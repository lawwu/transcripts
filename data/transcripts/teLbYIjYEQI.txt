[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540]   Now we have started considering the biblical teaching with regard to the
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.480]   ultimate and the last things, first of all from the personal standpoint. And
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.080]   last week we considered what the scriptures have to teach us about death
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.920]   and also about immortality. And we ended on this note that after death the souls
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.120]   of all who die go on. Death is not the end, there is a life beyond and we gave
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.440]   the scriptural proofs which established it and substantiate that contention. Now
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.520]   that we take up at that point, the next thing that obviously one asks is this. In
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.800]   the scriptures we thus discover that one goes on after death. In the scriptures
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.420]   also we have teaching about the resurrection. Now the question is, what
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.640]   happens between death and the resurrection? That is what is called the
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:16.000]   doctrine of the intermediate state. What is our condition in between death in
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.460]   this world and the resurrection which is to come? Now there has been a great deal
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.800]   of writing and talking and discussion about this. Let me try to deal with this
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.080]   as hurriedly as I can. I'm not going to deal with the Roman Catholic teaching
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.120]   with regard to purgatory and things like that, for again the good reason that
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.600]   there is really no biblical evidence for it. It is one of those things that they've
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.080]   added as we have seen from time to time, they have added other teachings also. But
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.580]   in apart from that there are certain loose and wrong ideas with regard to the
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.440]   intermediate state. There are some who think that it's a kind of vague state of
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.080]   being. Now that was the heathen teaching concerning the intermediate state. The
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.560]   heathen used to teach, you can find it in a great deal of classic literature, that
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.440]   the soul goes on into some vague, ill-defined condition where everything
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:32.160]   is nebulous and indistinct and where really there is no definition. Now that,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.120]   as I hope to show you, is very far indeed from being the biblical teaching. Then
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.320]   another idea that is sometimes thought is that after death the believer and the
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.040]   unbeliever pass in the same way to some common place which is called Hades or
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.880]   Sheol, and that there are two kinds of compartments in this common place for
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.640]   the dead. One of them Abram's bosom and the other the place of suffering. Now we
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.600]   might very well spend a long time with this, but I don't judge that it's a
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.440]   profitable thing to do. So let me put it like this, that the confusion has often
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:28.340]   arisen because the same word, this word Sheol, is used for a number of different
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.160]   ideas. Sometimes it simply means the grave. You read going down into Sheol when
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.120]   it really means going down into the grave. Or it sometimes just means the
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.920]   state of death. It doesn't mean anything more than being in the state of death.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.560]   And then at other times it means, obviously from the context, the place of
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.080]   punishment. So that if you are careful to observe the context, I think there need
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   be no difficulty about that particular aspect of the question. Then another and
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.960]   perhaps a more important one is this. The teaching with regard to the so-called
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.000]   sleep of the soul, which is teaching to this effect that when we die we enter
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.280]   upon a state of sleep, when we're unconscious. And that we will remain in
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.600]   this state of unconsciousness until the resurrection, the sleep of the soul. Now
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.280]   it is claimed that there is evidence to support that contention. For instance the
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.240]   Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 51 says, "We shall not all sleep." His teaching
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   there is, you remember, that some will remain on earth when our Lord does
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.960]   return, and that their bodies shall be changed. They, he says, shall not sleep.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.120]   We shall not all sleep. And there are various other statements in the
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.720]   Scripture that seem to teach that doctrine of the sleep of the soul. You
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.520]   will read in a psalm, for instance, "The dead praise thee not." And you'll find
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.360]   that stated many times in different ways in the Old Testament, "The dead praise
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.640]   thee not." And as I quoted last week, "Better a live dog than a dead lion." Which is
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.280]   again the same sort of idea, and might give the impression that there is some
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:37.440]   kind of sleep of the soul after death and until the resurrection. But that is
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.560]   rarely a complete misunderstanding of Scripture, because the Scripture teaches
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.640]   quite plainly a conscious existence after death and before the resurrection.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.480]   Now here is an important point and principle in the exposition of the
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.560]   Scripture. We must never build up a doctrine on an isolated statement. And
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.800]   this doctrine of the sleep of the soul rarely is based on 1 Corinthians 1551,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.520]   "They shall not all sleep," and the similar statements. Now it's quite clear that there
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.280]   the sleep just refers to the fact of death, that they're no longer alive. It's
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.400]   a kind of euphemism for death. Instead of speaking bluntly about death, he puts it
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.560]   in terms of sleeping. I say that because there is such definite evidence that the
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.040]   soul is not unconscious after death. And here's the evidence. First and foremost,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.200]   we again take the incident that happened on the Mount of Transfiguration. Moses
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.560]   and Elias appeared and spoken to our Lord. Clearly, therefore, they're not in
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.680]   this kind of unconscious state. They're not enduring this sleep of the soul,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.120]   waiting for the resurrection. Moses and Elias are in a state of consciousness.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.000]   Otherwise, they couldn't have appeared and have spoken in that way. But you've
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.600]   got the still more specific teaching of our Lord in Luke 16, on Divies and
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.160]   Lazarus. Lazarus and Divies are both conscious. Otherwise, there's no point
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.440]   whatsoever in his teaching. The whole purpose of the teaching is to show that
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.520]   this rich man is not only existing, but that he's conscious, and he's
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.080]   consciously suffering, and he's consciously aware of the state and the
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.920]   condition of his brethren who are still alive on earth. And obviously, Lazarus is
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.160]   also alive. Otherwise, the rich men couldn't plead that Lazarus be allowed
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.840]   to go to him to relieve him. Then, of course, there is the still more important
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.240]   statement, in a sense, our Lord's word to the penitent thief on the cross, "Today
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:09.520]   thou shalt be with me in paradise." Now, that is, of course, vital. Luke 23, 43. Put
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.640]   it with the others. And then you've got statements made by the Apostle Paul in
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:21.360]   the second epistle to the Corinthians in the fifth chapter. Take, for instance,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.920]   this statement of his in verse 8, "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:33.160]   be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord." Now, that is
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:40.680]   perfectly plain and implies at once this conscious existence in the presence of
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   the Lord. 2 Corinthians 5, 8. And, still more striking, and still more
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.360]   explicit, perhaps, those magnificent statements in the first chapter of the
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:59.120]   epistle to the Philippians, where the Apostle says, "For to me to live is
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.800]   Christ and to die is gain." But here it is in verse 23, "For I am in a straight
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.040]   betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:17.480]   better." Now, it cannot be argued that it's far better to be in a state of sleep with
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:24.040]   a soul in an unconscious condition. No, that would not be far better than the
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.280]   conscious communion of the believer in this world with our Lord. Paul is
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.520]   enjoying his present communion, "To me to live," he says, "is Christ." It cannot be
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.040]   better than that to go into a state of unconsciousness. No, what he says is this,
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.760]   "To die is far better," because it means going to be with Christ and enjoying his
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:51.040]   conscious presence face-to-face. It must mean that otherwise he has no argument.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.200]   And again in Revelation 6, 9 we are told of the souls of them that had been put
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.160]   to death by persecution under the altar, pleading and praying for the end to come,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:13.280]   and for the vengeance of God to be effected upon their cruel oppressors, and
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.640]   so on. Well thus, you see, there is an abundance of evidence which proves that
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:26.120]   this doctrine of the sleep of the soul after death is entirely unscriptural. No,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:35.720]   it is a conscious existence. The soul is not asleep. We can even go
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   further and say this, that both the believer and the unbeliever will be in a
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:51.000]   conscious condition, the believer enjoying untold bliss and joy, the
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.600]   unbeliever in a state of misery. Now there is the first statement ever with
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.360]   regard to the intermediate state. Now having dealt with that, we must come on
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.920]   to something else, which again often troubles people, and at the present time
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:19.360]   I think particularly is becoming more and more popular as a teaching. I take up
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.480]   the subject of what is called conditional immortality, or if you like
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.200]   another word for it, annihilationism. Conditional immortality or the belief
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.440]   that the souls of the unbelievers will be utterly destroyed and will pass
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:46.240]   entirely out of existence. Annihilationism. Now the teaching as put
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:56.120]   forward is something like this, that man is not naturally immortal, that man is
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:06.960]   naturally mortal. Immortality, they say, is a gift which is given by God only to
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.880]   those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the essence of their
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.280]   belief, that the gift of eternal life, which they reinterpret partly as the
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   gift of immortality, is only given to those who believe on the Lord Jesus
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:32.860]   Christ. With regard to the others, they say that their souls will go out of
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:40.120]   existence, will be utterly destroyed. Now they disagree amongst
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.200]   themselves. There are certain schools, some say that the souls of the
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:51.800]   unbelievers will be destroyed the moment they die. Others say no, that isn't so.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.840]   They will be kept alive for a certain length of time, during which they will
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.680]   suffer and will be punished, but there will be an end to that period of
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.800]   punishment and of suffering, and at the end of that period they will be finally
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:16.560]   destroyed and will simply cease to exist altogether and forever. Now that is the
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:24.120]   statement of the doctrine. What arguments have they for this idea?
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.960]   Well, they're very fond of quoting that statement which I quoted several times
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:39.200]   last Friday evening, which says that "God alone hath immortality." "God who alone
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:46.040]   hath immortality," says Paul to Timothy. Now they say that must mean what it says,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.200]   that only God is immortal. But we indicated last Friday that while
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.760]   everyone, of course, must accept that and agree with it, it doesn't preclude the
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.160]   possibility that God has given the gift of immortality to all men. To say that
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.080]   God alone is immortal doesn't mean of necessity that he hasn't given the gift
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:11.000]   in that way. However, that's one of their arguments. Then they also say that
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.280]   immortality is referred to in the Scriptures as a gift. The gift of God is
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   eternal life. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, says Paul in the sixth of Romans.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   But the real argument which they bring forward is this. It plays upon terms like
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:48.840]   destruction and perish and death. Now they say destruction means destruction.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.320]   They say surely it is inconceivable that something can go on being destroyed
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.280]   forever. They say that's no longer destruction. Destruction, according to
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.800]   them, means complete disintegration and the end of the thing as such. And they
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:13.000]   say that perish and death likewise must mean the end of existence. And when you
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.120]   quote to them 2 Thessalonians 1 9, which speaks of everlasting destruction, they
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:27.640]   say that it is something which to them is impossible. Now what are we to say
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:34.600]   about this doctrine? Well, I suggest to you that the whole general sense and
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.680]   teaching of the Scripture is altogether against it. What I mean by that is this,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.760]   that if you start at the first verse of Genesis and go right through your Bible,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.200]   you would never gain the impression, it would never even enter into your mind,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:58.320]   that anything is taught in the Scriptures save that the world is
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.560]   divided up into those who are Christian and those who are not, those who belong
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.440]   to God and those who don't, and that those who belong to him go on to
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.640]   everlasting bliss, and that those who don't go on to everlasting punishment
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.200]   and destruction. The general sense of the Scripture is against it. And in all
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.680]   these discussions, the general sense of the Scripture is a most important factor.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.280]   We must be very careful to arrive at any conclusion which is at variance with the
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:34.640]   general tenor and sense of scriptural teaching. I suggest that this does. Not
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:43.560]   only that, I would say that the whole teaching of the Scripture is contrary to
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.840]   that, as I hope to show you. It's even positively against it, and thereby it is
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.080]   in agreement, the Scripture is in agreement with what we can describe as
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:04.800]   the common instinct of mankind. And the common instinct of mankind is to believe
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.560]   that after death the soul goes on and goes on forever. Now let me give you one
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.360]   illustration out of the Scripture. We read in the second chapter of the epistle
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.920]   to the Hebrews, starting at verse 14, "For as much then as the children are
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.120]   partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same,
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.320]   that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:38.200]   devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:45.240]   to bondage." The whole human race is afraid of death. And why is it afraid of
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.080]   death? It is afraid of death because it's afraid of the punishment that will come
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.320]   upon sin after death. As there is a common instinct in the whole of mankind
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.560]   to believe in a supreme God, it's in every man was born into this world. Every
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.840]   man has an idea of a supreme God. In the same way there is this instinct in human
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.240]   nature that death is something to be feared. Why? Not because it means
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.440]   extinction and annihilation. Many people would be very glad indeed to believe that
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.840]   that is true. They'd say, "It doesn't matter then what you do in this world when
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.400]   you die, there's the end of it." Oh no, mankind is afraid of death because it has
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.040]   a belief within it, innate, that there is judgment after death, as the scripture
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.800]   teaches, and that there is suffering and punishment, and that it goes on forever
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:44.000]   and forever. They're in bondage because of the fear of death. But there are still
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.800]   other arguments which are more powerful. Take this word "eternal." Eternal
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:57.560]   destruction, everlasting destruction. These are the terms that are used. Now
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:07.840]   this word "eternal," sometimes it is perfectly true, refers only to an age. And
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.760]   our friends are very fond of saying that that as regards the punishment it
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.840]   only means a particular measure of time, an age. And they say that it sometimes
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.880]   means to the ages of ages, and so on. But let us remember this. This same word
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:32.080]   "eternal" is used about the being of God the Father, about God the Son, and God the
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.920]   Holy Spirit. The eternal Father, the eternal Son, the eternal Spirit. And there
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:47.560]   obviously they carry the sense of endlessness, everlastingness, from
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:55.360]   eternity to eternity, the eternal God. It's the same word. Now the same word is
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.760]   also used always in the parallels and contrasts that are drawn in the
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   scripture between the believers and the unbelievers. It is either eternal life or
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:13.360]   eternal destruction. Let me give you the best example of all, perhaps the
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:21.400]   last verse of Matthew 25, Matthew 25 46. "And these shall go away into everlasting
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.480]   punishment, but the righteous unto life eternal." The contrast between the
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.400]   unrighteous and the righteous is the contrast between everlasting punishment
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:39.640]   and everlasting life. And if everlasting as regards punishment means only for a
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.360]   while and then this extinction, why shouldn't everlasting mean exactly the
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.640]   same about the righteous and the life that they're going to inherit? Now there
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.720]   is no exception to this. Constantly in the scripture the fate of the believer
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.440]   and the unbeliever are contrasted in that way. And each time the same word
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.400]   exactly is used in both cases. Eternal on the one hand, eternal on the other. So if
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.680]   there is no such thing as everlasting destruction, there is no such thing as
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.720]   everlasting life. And all that is promised to the believer is only going to
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:22.400]   last for a while and then come to an end. Now there is nothing plainer surely in
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.600]   the scripture than that. Indeed the best and most expert Greek scholars are
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:36.640]   agreed in saying this, that there is no word in the Greek language to express
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:44.400]   the sense of eternal endless duration as this particular word which is used both
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.280]   regard to the destruction and with regard to the life. Surely nothing can be
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.980]   plainer than that. But if you want something further you can put it like
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:04.280]   this. In Jude 6 we read that the certain angels have been reserved in
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:10.680]   everlasting chains. And we are told elsewhere in the book of Revelation that
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:16.640]   the unbelievers will be cast into the same place as these fallen angels that
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.240]   are in these everlasting chains and shall share their fate. But finally, and
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:29.480]   perhaps the most convincing argument of all, it is the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.560]   who speaks about the fire that shall not be quenched. What can be stronger than
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:44.120]   that? The fire that shall not be quenched. It's never going to end. And if all those
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.200]   who are opposed to God are going to be destroyed, well you don't need a fire
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.880]   that shall never be quenched. A time would come when the fire would no longer
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.840]   be necessary and therefore would be quenched. It is he also who speaks about
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:10.040]   the worm that dieth not, suggesting this everlasting eternal existence in a state
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:17.640]   of punishment. Let me say this. I can well understand those who seek the scriptures
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:24.280]   with great diligence in order to avoid this doctrine. But my dear friends, we
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.520]   mustn't base doctrines on our feelings. People say, "I can't conceive of the love
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.400]   of God doing something like that." Perhaps you can't. But after all, our beliefs are
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.760]   to be based not upon what you and I can conceive, but upon what we read in the
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   scriptures. We are not only finite, we are sinful. You and I are incapable of
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.480]   judging the love of God truly. Our minds are not big enough, they're not straight
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.880]   enough, they're not clear enough, they're not pure enough. And for men to argue in
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   terms of what they think the love of God should do, is not only to be utterly
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.120]   unscriptural, but is rarely to put yourself into the position of the
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.640]   unbeliever. For that is precisely what he does about the atonement and about almost
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.720]   every other single doctrine of our glorious salvation. He doesn't see it, he
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.360]   doesn't understand it, therefore he doesn't believe it. Let us be very
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.240]   careful that face-to-face with this tremendous statement, this doctrine, we do
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.360]   not put ourselves into the condition of the unbeliever and argue as a
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.480]   philosopher rather than as one who submits his mind to the scriptural
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.840]   teaching. I must leave it at that, because I want to take up another subject this
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.400]   evening before we finish. The next subject is the question of a second
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:25:04.720]   chance. Is there beyond death another opportunity for salvation? Is our eternal
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:11.760]   fate and destiny settled in this world? Or is there another presentation of the
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.720]   gospel beyond death and the grave? Now, here again, as you know, is a doctrine
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.560]   that has been taught, especially during the last hundred years, and has been
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:29.760]   popular in certain circles. There are those who believe that another chance,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.880]   another opportunity will be given to those who have died in unbelief. On what
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.920]   do they base that theory? Well, again, their main argument generally is their
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.000]   idea of the love of God. They can't conceive of the love of God not doing
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.440]   this, as we shall see still later on in the new year sometime, God willing. There
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.640]   are those who press this argument of the love of God to this extent, that they say
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.280]   that ultimately everybody will be saved, the larger hope, even the devil they say
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.520]   is going to be saved. There will be no such thing as anybody remaining rebellious
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:10.000]   against God. However, the argument here is again the love of God. But they do try
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.360]   to claim that they've got two scriptures to support them. And the two scriptures
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.960]   are found in the passage that we have read together at the beginning tonight.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.680]   The first is in the first epistle of Peter, the third chapter, and the nineteenth
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:38.120]   verse, 1 Peter 3 19, "By which also he Christ went and preached unto the spirits
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.400]   in prison." You remember the argument, don't you? "For Christ also hath once
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.440]   suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.960]   being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit in by which also
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:00.600]   he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which sometime were disobedient,
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.240]   when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.680]   was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water." That's one
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:19.320]   of them. The second is the sixth verse of the next chapter, 1 Peter 4 6, "For for
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:27.640]   this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:34.440]   judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit." Now
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.840]   those are the only two scriptures that they claim to support their teaching.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.560]   Well now, that means that we really must face these two scriptures and expand
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:55.160]   them. Take, first of all, 1 Peter 3 19. What does this teach? Now there are some
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:00.440]   who have tried to avoid this difficulty by saying that what 1 Peter 3 19 means is
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:07.800]   this, that the Lord Jesus Christ in spirit through the apostles was then
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:15.280]   preaching the gospel to the men of the first years of the Christian church. But
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:22.720]   that is surely quite impossible, because the emphasis is here that it is not the
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.160]   apostles preaching, but that it is Christ in spirit, the Christ who has been put to
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.080]   death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit, in which also he went and preached.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.040]   Quite apart from that, that explanation doesn't explain to us why this term
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.440]   about the spirits in prison is used. And still less does it explain the reference
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.400]   to the men of the time of Noah and the flood. So we can leave that all together.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.120]   Certain people, I say, have thought there was no difficulty here at all, because
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.720]   they could explain it like that. But that patently is not right.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:04.440]   Another explanation which has been put forward has been this, that what it says
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.840]   is that our Lord Jesus Christ, after his death and burial, and before again he rose
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   from the dead, that he went to these spirits in Hades and proclaimed judgment
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:27.240]   upon the impenitent dead. They say what this means is this, that he descended
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.160]   into hell and there he proclaimed judgment upon all the Old Testament and
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:37.960]   those in the New Testament times who had rejected God and his wonderful salvation.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:44.720]   But again this is quite impossible, because the word translated "preached"
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:53.400]   means to proclaim an evangel, to proclaim good news. And therefore it cannot mean
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.640]   pronouncing judgment, because it means good news, and judgment is not good news.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:05.240]   Not only that, there is a further difficulty. If it means that, why then
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:11.280]   this peculiar particular reference to the men of Noah's time? They were no
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.080]   greater sinners than the sinners that followed in the subsequent generations
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.640]   of the Old Testament. But the reference is particularly to those at the time of
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:28.760]   the flood, so that I say that that explanation must go out also. Then a
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:35.440]   third explanation is this one. That what it really teaches is that the Lord Jesus
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:41.680]   Christ, between his death and his resurrection, went to this place in which
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:49.160]   the dead remain, and that there he preached the gospel to the righteous
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.840]   dead of the Old Testament dispensation. They mean those who had served God
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.040]   according to the light they had, and had lived according to the law. People like
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.680]   John the Baptist's father and mother, and others who are described as righteous
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.120]   persons, all the righteous of the old dispensation. He went to them and said,
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.800]   "Now you believed God, and because of that I am now preaching the gospel to you. I am
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:21.160]   here to tell you what I've done for you." And thereby he completes their salvation.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.260]   But again, of course, it's quite impossible. How can such people be
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.560]   described as spirits in prison? They are not in prison. There is nothing to
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.480]   suggest that the righteous dead of the Old Testament can be described as being
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.720]   in a kind of prison house. Not at all. As I've shown you, Moses and Elias were
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.360]   clearly not in such a condition. But again, why this extraordinary reference
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:53.480]   to the men of nurse type, if it is simply to be explained as preaching the gospel
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:32:00.560]   to the righteous dead? No, that again, it seems to me, must be excluded. Then there
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:06.280]   are those who go further and say this, that what the Lord did when he thus
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:13.320]   descended to Hades between his death and his resurrection, was to offer the
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:19.160]   gospel of grace. And now there's a subdivision. Some say that he offered it
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:26.360]   to everybody in Hades, righteous and unrighteous alike. To everybody. Others
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:36.320]   say that he offered it only to those men of nurse generation, and only to those of
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.680]   nurse generation who repented at the very last moment when the flood came. They
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.200]   say the flood came very suddenly upon them. They didn't have time as it were to
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.080]   express their repentance, but in their last agony and gasp they repented. And
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:56.640]   our Lord went and offered grace to them because of that last-minute repentance
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:06.200]   on their part. Others say that he offered it to all who were drowned at the time
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.120]   of Noah because of the suddenness of their death. That their death was so
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.840]   sudden that it wasn't really quite fair to them, and therefore they are given
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:21.880]   this further opportunity of grace. And there are those who say that it is an
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:28.400]   offer that was made by him then to all, not only the men of nurse time, but to
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.600]   all other times. And they go even further and say that it will go on being offered
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:42.240]   to all and sundry until the very end of the world itself. Well now, what are we to
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:50.640]   say to all this? Well, again, we start by saying that the whole tenor of
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:58.880]   scriptural teaching is entirely against it. Surely, again, if you read your Bible
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.360]   from beginning to end, you must get the impression that this life and this world
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:11.080]   is the one in which our eternal destiny is settled. I say that no impartial and
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.800]   prejudiced person can read the Bible without coming to that conclusion, but
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:21.160]   then the scripture supports it in detail. Go back again to Davies and Lazarus. It
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.680]   is our Lord himself who teaches that there is a gulf fixed, and that there is
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   no passing from one state to another. There is no glimmer of a hope offered to
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   that man, Davies, the rich man. There is nothing said about a second chance. He is
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.800]   reminded that he's had his chance, and that he's rejected it. Our Lord's own
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.280]   explicit and specific teaching surely should be sufficient for us. How
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.040]   precarious it is to found a doctrine and a theory upon a passage of scripture
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:00.080]   such as this, in the light of our Lord's own perfectly plain teaching. Not only
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.880]   that in John 8 he talks about people dying in their sins, and the three
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:14.080]   parables in Matthew 25 surely leave it beyond any doubt whatsoever. But not
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:21.400]   only that, let's come back to this particular passage. What possible
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:29.000]   connection can any of those expositions have, which is with the very drift and
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.840]   meaning of this passage? There is really nothing in the passage that tells us
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.880]   that our Lord between his death and his resurrection did anything at all, leave
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.680]   alone anything of this particular type. What the passage talks about is this, a
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.280]   difference between our Lord in the flesh and our Lord in a spiritual condition.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:00.560]   Our Lord while he was here on earth was in a fleshy condition. Our Lord before he
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.960]   came into the world and after he went out of the world is in a spiritual
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:10.080]   condition. Surely that's the teaching of the passage. It says that he died
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:17.880]   according to the flesh, but was quickened in the spirit. And it is after his
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:23.960]   quickening we are told that he is in the spirit. Again we must bring into
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:30.280]   consideration this whole reference to the men of Noah's time, and all this
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:38.440]   teaching about the ark being prepared. It's a vital part of the exposition. But
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:45.840]   still more important is this. The Apostle Peter clearly in this whole epistle and
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:52.080]   particularly in this section, is concerned to give comfort and
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.040]   consolation and encouragement to Christian people who are suffering. That's
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.400]   the context. Now I feel that all those other expositions have gone astray
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:08.440]   because they do not remember the context. The whole context is about suffering, and
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:14.960]   he's strengthening them and helping them. Now the question I ask is this, how did
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:21.720]   it help those Christian people to endure suffering to be told that those who had
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.520]   died impenitent at the time of the deluge are going to have another
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.440]   opportunity of salvation? How does it help these Christian people, these
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.280]   Christians who were suffering, to be told that after death there's going to be a
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:41.320]   second chance for the unbeliever? It's utterly irrelevant. It has no connection
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:48.160]   whatsoever. It would be a completely pointless and useless remark.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:55.520]   Very well then, let's try to expound it in its own setting. The Apostle I say is
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:02.120]   encouraging these people in their trials and face to face with death. Indeed he's
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:11.040]   going beyond that. He says the end of all things is at hand. He says later on in
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.560]   that fourth chapter that judgment must begin at the house of God. The time has
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.680]   come that judgment must begin there. And if it must, and if it first begin at us,
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:26.920]   what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel? And so on. What is his
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:34.560]   setting? Well his idea clearly is this, that these people as it were are at the
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.480]   end time. They're suffering persecution and hardships and trials. That's the
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.680]   whole condition of crisis. So the encouragement and the consolation he
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.360]   gives them is this. He says take the example of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:57.920]   himself. He said men killed him even after the flesh, but that wasn't the end.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:03.000]   He was quickened in the Spirit. The most that men can do to you is to kill the
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   flesh as it were. They can't touch the Spirit. That's his first statement. He
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.920]   brings that in in verse 18. "For" he says. Now you notice in 17 he says, "For it is
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.560]   better if the will of God be so, that he suffer for well-doing than for evil
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:26.160]   doing. For Christ also hath once suffered for us." And then he goes on to say that he
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.480]   suffered in the flesh, but that the Spirit still goes on. There's the first
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:39.440]   thing therefore. Not only that, he argues this, doesn't he? That our Lord is still
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.920]   doing in the Spirit what he did in the flesh. He helped men while he was here in
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.440]   the flesh and encouraged them and strengthened them. Risen from the dead
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.360]   though men did kill him, he's still the same and in spirit he is still doing the
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:05.920]   same thing. Not only that, he goes on, as I suggest to you, to teach this. The Lord
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.320]   Jesus Christ, when he was here in the flesh, he warned men. He called them to
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.880]   repent, to flee from the wrath to come. He warned them against the terrible
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:22.200]   consequences of not believing him and disobeying God. And on top of it he told
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.760]   them that he had come to save them. That's his message. He's still doing that,
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:34.520]   says Peter. Yes, he's not only still doing it, he's done it once before. "There was
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:42.840]   another occasion in this world," says the Apostle, "when judgment came upon mankind,
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:49.480]   when the end of all things was at hand." When was it? It was at the time of the
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:57.800]   flood. That is the only previous occasion when the whole world was judged and this
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:03.200]   final separation took place. Now you see why the Apostle refers to the time of
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.260]   Noah and of the flood and why he tells us all this about the preparing of the
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:14.400]   ark. It's got no sense nor meaning apart from that. Now then, says Peter, go back
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:22.040]   and look at that old time. What do you find? Well, you find this. Christ was then
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.400]   preaching to people, even as he did in the days of his flesh and as he's doing
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.560]   now. He used Noah to build an ark to warn the people against the deluge. It went on
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.640]   for a hundred and twenty years. It was Christ preaching righteousness,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:43.720]   doing things as well as the words of Noah, warning people about their fate,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.560]   about the destruction that was to come, and showing them that they could be
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:53.680]   saved if they but believed the word and entered into the ark. But they wouldn't,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.560]   they rejected it. Ah yes, but those who did, Noah and his family, they were only
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.200]   eight, but they believed and they went into the ark. And because they went into
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.960]   the ark believing him, their souls were saved and in spite of the deluge, they
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:17.500]   went on. It's exactly like that now, says Peter. That ark is just a sort of picture
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:23.300]   of baptism. Those who believe on Christ and were baptized into him enter into
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.800]   the ark of salvation. Oh yes, men may destroy you in the flesh as they
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.740]   destroyed Christ in the flesh. It doesn't matter. If you're in Christ, your spirit
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:40.000]   is safe. He rose and you will rise with him, as he was put to death but
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.800]   goes on in the spirit. Though they may kill your bodies, if you're in the ark
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.680]   Christ by baptism, your spirits are absolutely safe, and men simply cannot
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.720]   harm you at all. He even uses that very expression, you remember. He says, "Who is
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:03.680]   it that can harm you, if indeed you are in Christ?" Well, very well then, it seems
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.000]   to me that that is the teaching here. His whole point is that Christ has overcome
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.320]   death. Therefore, as Noah, who listened to him before the flood, overcame the flood,
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:22.560]   we can also overcome everything, the fiery trial that may come upon us, and we
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   shall be safe with him, because though he has been crucified in the flesh, he's
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:34.360]   alive in spirit, and he's reigning, and he is the Lord of all. Very well. Now, when
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:40.080]   you come to 1 Peter 4, 6, I suggest to you that very similar arguments are of
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:46.120]   equal cogency. There is a statement on the surface which seems to say that there
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.880]   is preaching after death, for for this cause was the gospel preached also to
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:57.280]   them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:03.520]   live according to God in the spirit. Now, they try to interpret that as meaning
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:11.120]   that the gospel was preached again to those who are dead, and they bring in
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:17.840]   these various groups after all. But surely there is nothing here at all to
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.000]   say that the gospel was preached to anybody after their death. That isn't
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.040]   what we are told. We are not told that they died and then the gospel was
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   preached to them. What we are told is that the gospel was preached to certain
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.320]   people who are now dead, which is a very different thing. And that is precisely
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:45.440]   what we are told. The gospel was preached to them that are now dead. They were
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:50.240]   alive when it was preached to them. So that really the very words here preclude
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.880]   that other explanation. But again, let me put this argument to you.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:02.920]   Luther is still writing to the same people. How can it possibly help these
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:09.360]   suffering Christians to be told that there will be another opportunity of
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.320]   salvation given to the very people who are persecuting them? It's no comfort at
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:20.320]   all. It's another pure bit of irrelevance. It has no sense nor meaning. No, no. The
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:28.560]   Apostle is again saying exactly the same thing. What he's saying is this. Those men,
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:35.560]   he said, those Christians to whom the gospel was preached and who believed the
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:42.640]   gospel, they have certainly suffered, been judged, if you like, or even condemned, if
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:50.760]   you like, as men according to the flesh. But they're all right. They're alive
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   according to the Spirit. That's his statement. He said you needn't be
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:01.080]   troubled about your loved ones who have gone on and who died. That was something
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   that greatly troubled this first generation of Christians, as you
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.840]   remember. The Apostle Paul is to deal with the same thing in writing to the
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.720]   Thessalonians. They kept on saying we'll be all right, of course, when Christ
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.760]   returns, but what about those who are dead? What's going to happen to them?
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.360]   There was this curious feeling that those who had died, and especially those
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.040]   who died the death of martyrdom, were somehow or other being robbed of their
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.000]   salvation. That's the very thing that Peter's dealing with here. He says you
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.920]   needn't trouble about those who are dead. You needn't trouble about dead believers.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.400]   They've certainly been put to death according to the flesh, as Christ
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.720]   himself was, but as he is alive according to the Spirit, so are they. They're in his
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:50.320]   safekeeping. You needn't have any concern at all. The gospel was preached to them
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:47:00.560]   likewise, as it is to you now, for this reason, that if they believed in Christ
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.960]   they would have no need to fear being put to death in the flesh at all. They
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:12.360]   would know that they're perfectly safe, and they are perfectly safe. You see to it,
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.520]   says Peter to them, that you are equally sure and certain of your salvation as
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:23.960]   they were. And then, though men may kill your bodies and put you to death in the
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.560]   flesh, it'll make no difference to you at all. You may be condemned, you may be
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.600]   judged, just as men, as ordinary men in the flesh, and there they condemn you to
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.560]   death and you're put to death. That's all right, that's only physical, that's as men
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:46.080]   in an external sense. But in the Spirit, you will be alive unto God. You'll go on
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:52.760]   living in that spiritual condition. Therefore his argument is this. Have
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.400]   nothing to do with the unbelievers. Don't live as they live any longer, he says. The
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.800]   time past of your life was sufficient to do that sort of thing. Have nothing at
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.720]   all to do with them. And not only have nothing at all to do with them, don't be
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.680]   afraid of them. They can only destroy your bodies, but they can't touch your
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:16.080]   soul. You belong to this Christ whom they also killed, but whose spirit they
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.640]   couldn't touch. Have nothing to do with them. Sanctify the Lord God in your
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   hearts, and be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in you at all times. And
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:30.480]   if you must suffer, suffer as a Christian, and then all will be well with you. Make
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:35.440]   sure of Christ and your relationship to him, and then none of these things can
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:42.240]   touch you. Surely, if you take these two verses in their whole context, in their
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.920]   setting, if you remember this reference to Nirn, the time of the flood, and the
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:53.080]   preparation of the ark, and the emphasis that's laid upon that, surely you must
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.560]   agree that the only adequate and satisfactory exposition of the two
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:04.280]   verses is the one that I have thus tried to put before you. In other words, there
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.800]   is not a vestige of evidence in the whole Scripture that there is a further
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:17.400]   opportunity of salvation given to anyone beyond death and the grave. No, my
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:25.080]   friends, what makes preaching so vital and urgent and important is this, that it
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:34.640]   is in this life and in this world that the eternal destiny of all men and women
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:42.880]   is determined. Let us remember, therefore, that we all have a responsibility to the
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   men and women round and about us. Don't comfort yourself by saying they'll have
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:53.520]   another chance after death, or they'll finally be destroyed. We must
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:50:00.980]   live in this world and deal with men and women as believing that their eternal
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:08.960]   bliss and joy, or their eternal unhappiness and wretchedness, is decided
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   and determined by their belief or rejection of the gospel of God's
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:27.120]   wondrous grace in the Lord Jesus Christ in this present world. Knowing the
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:36.960]   terror of the Lord, we persuade men. God enable us to do so. Amen.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.080]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
