[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840]   This question comes from Annalisa,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.840]   who asks, what do you tell your students
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.720]   about phone use in class?
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.520]   Well, my policy has converged to me not bringing it up.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.320]   Essentially, the configuration of the type of classes I teach
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.520]   are such that it is to your peril
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.840]   if you are trying to divide your attention.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.280]   Because I teach technical classes--
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.720]   algorithms, mathematics, theoretical computer science--
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.960]   if you stop paying attention to look at your phone,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.840]   you will miss the thing I'm explaining.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.280]   And if you miss the thing I'm explaining,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.120]   that's going to be an issue, because you need
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.420]   know how to do it for your exam.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.480]   So because of the technical rigor of my classes,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.520]   it's just a natural side effect that most people
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.920]   aren't going to use their phone.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.480]   And if people want to, then I think
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.200]   there's just natural consequences.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.920]   I'm not really of the mindset that I should
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.240]   be talking to fellow adults.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.280]   And if you're at college, you're a fellow adult,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.160]   and telling them how they should or shouldn't behave,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.720]   we'll leave them up to that to make that discovery.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480]   Two things to say about this, though.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.540]   One, I may have a biased perspective.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.960]   Because my reputation now precedes me,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.360]   my students might be unusually compliant about not
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   using the phone in a way that other academics might not
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   enjoy.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.440]   In other words, they might be a little bit nervous
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.280]   to be on their phone in a Cal Newport class.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.800]   That might be going on.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.360]   Two, I will say there was an occasion a few years ago,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.120]   teaching a PhD level class.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.200]   It was a theory of computer science, doctoral theory class.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   And there were some students on their phone.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.920]   Some of my grad students were on their phone.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.320]   And I did talk to them about it.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.120]   And I said, you know, this is a small class.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.360]   It has complicated material.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.200]   And I don't know if you should be on your phone
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.160]   or whatever it was.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.080]   I actually confronted them about it.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.480]   And it turned out that they were actually
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   looking up what I was talking about in class.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.240]   Or they had their textbook on their phone.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   I forgot exactly what it was.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160]   But it made complete sense why they were on their phone.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.520]   They weren't looking at their email.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.120]   They weren't looking at social media.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.280]   They were actually trying to pay attention even better
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.160]   to what I was saying.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.040]   So I kind of learned my lesson there.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.080]   I'm not going to yell at people.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.880]   I teach in such a way that it is in your benefit
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.760]   to pay attention.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.180]   But if you want to check your phone, you're adults.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.040]   And it's not my role to tell you what to do.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
