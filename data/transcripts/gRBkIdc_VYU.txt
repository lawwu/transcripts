[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   I'm Cal Newport and I want to talk to you for a moment about reading.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.040]   As a professor and writer, reading is an important part of my life.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.140]   My goal is to read five books every month and to hold myself accountable on the first
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.200]   episode of my podcast, Deep Questions each month, I actually go through the five books
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.680]   I read that month before.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.720]   You can actually go back and see what I have been reading.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.120]   Now people often wonder how do I do this?
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.920]   Five books seems like a lot to get through in a month, but I don't actually think it
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.120]   is.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.060]   So I want to share my secrets to how I get through so many titles.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.480]   So quickly, I'm going to have five reasons to share with you.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.260]   Four are small.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.320]   The fifth is going to be the big critical one.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.360]   Now before we get into those five reasons, let's briefly answer the question of why this
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.560]   even matters.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.160]   Why bother reading so many books?
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.840]   Well I am convinced that if you do intellectual work, so if one of the primary ways you make
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:14.440]   money is by creating value with your brain, alchemizing dollars out of the stuff of thoughts,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.880]   reading is critical to you.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.760]   Why because reading is to your brain what exercise is to your body.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   To work with books means you are grappling with complex ideas, trying to make connections
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.520]   between different types of theories or ways of seeing the world.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.360]   It helps your ability to empathetically put yourself into other people's shoes and understand
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960]   life through other people's eyes.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.280]   All of this is critical.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.520]   It's calisthenics for the gray matter up here.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.300]   It is a huge competitive advantage if you work in knowledge work.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.000]   You need to work out your brain.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.040]   Reading is one of the best workouts that we know about.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.160]   I mean I find it to be surprising the degree to which we obsess so much about physical
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.960]   health and we get into minutia about different exercise routines or supplements or exactly
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   how you eat and yet we barely think at all about how to keep our brain operating at its
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.520]   full capacity even though for most of us we depend way more for our livelihood on our
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.400]   brain than we do these days on our body.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.320]   So I care about getting the most out of our brain.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.920]   Reading is a fantastic way to do this.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320]   Alright five books a month.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.600]   Five ways to help you get there.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.640]   Number one choose more interesting books.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.000]   Now I think this is something that trips people up.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.960]   They think about what book should I be reading.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.520]   What book is going to impress other people if they heard I read it.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.840]   This is a quick way to get stuck.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.140]   To hit a dead end on some giant tome and just give up on reading altogether for a while.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.080]   Choose a wide variety of books.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   Switch between novels that are just absolutely fun and you're lost in with nonfiction books
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.680]   that are just hitting a sweet spot.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.360]   Mix in some deeper books or some more interesting books.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.760]   Big variety.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.320]   Different difficulties.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.880]   Different styles.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.600]   Also mix between audio and written.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.840]   I think that's absolutely fine.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.440]   Find what genre of books you can listen to well that are compelling on audio.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.800]   Some are better in your ear than they are on the page and always have one of those going.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.600]   That's one or two books a month already happening just in your spare time.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.000]   So mix it up.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.360]   In the month that we're in right now and I'm recording this for example.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.720]   I read Lost Moon.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.300]   This is just a nonfiction account of the Apollo 13 disaster.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.740]   It reads like a thriller.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.420]   It's just a fun book.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.840]   It's easy to get lost in and you could just go down a rabbit hole and get lost in it.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.760]   At the same time I also read a much more dense biography of Daniel Boone.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.640]   I was just curious about that point of American history.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.240]   You mix it up.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.380]   Alright that's number one.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.040]   Number two.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.240]   Schedule reading sessions like you schedule exercise.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.680]   So give them respect in your schedule.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   Hey, you know what?
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.600]   I'm going to get home from work at this point.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.980]   I'm going to put aside a half hour I want to read today.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.120]   For tonight between dinner and when we put on a show I'm going to have a reading session.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680]   Sunday morning before we get out of the house I want to put aside an hour to read.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.720]   Start actually putting reading on your calendar just like you would with exercise.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.440]   Very few people tackle physical exercise with the mindset of if I have time and I'm in the
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.760]   mood I'll do it.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.180]   As we know from long experience that means you will do exactly zero hours of exercise.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.520]   The same is true for reading.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.760]   If you're just saying, hey, if I have a lot of time and I'm in the mood to read then I'll
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.880]   do it.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.160]   You're not going to find that time.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.380]   Pages will not get turned.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.380]   So treat the activity with respect.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.020]   Actually schedule time.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.960]   Number three.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   Put rituals around reading that makes it more enjoyable.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.280]   I like for example if it's a Friday night, it's the end of a long week to have a drink
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.940]   with a book and just sort of get lost in my study, just lost in a book and enjoy a little
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.840]   bit of bourbon.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   There's something to that.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.880]   I also like leveraging during the nice weather months my porch.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   I have a nice porch.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.080]   I have an outdoor couch on it.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.920]   There's some columns that frame a bunch of plants in front of me.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.260]   It's all very verdant.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.560]   It's all very scenic.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   I like going out there and reading.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   If I'm reading a demanding book, I like to have something like tea or coffee with me.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.240]   If I'm reading a fun book like a novel, I like to have some crackers to chew on.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.960]   That's an old habit from my childhood.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.340]   But nice rituals surrounding the reading makes you more likely to do it.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.600]   Number four.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   Do closing pushes.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.700]   This is a big part of my secret to getting through all five books each month.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.000]   When you're just working on a book or two in the background and you get close to finishing
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.520]   one, and by close I mean you're at that last 100 pages, you have some momentum, you've
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.040]   been working on this book for a while and you can see the finish line in the hazy distance.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.800]   You say, you know what?
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.760]   Let's just get this done.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.520]   I'm going to put aside two and a half hours.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.640]   I'm going to hold myself up and I'm just going to go, go, go.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.860]   I'm going to the coffee shop, you know, hold my calls, two hours.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.280]   I'm going to push final sprint.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.320]   Let's get to the finish line.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   That really helps.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.380]   So instead of just petering off or trailing off as you get towards the end of a book,
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.140]   this allows you to actually push to get done.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.300]   This brings us to the fifth idea for reading more each month.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.200]   The most important of the five ideas I talk about in this video, and that is to take everything
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.780]   interesting off your phone.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.500]   This is my secret weapon.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   Perhaps the most important secret weapon I have to support my reading life is the fact
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.440]   that I have never had a social media account.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.500]   The effect of this is that my phone is not very interesting.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.280]   There's not much for me to look at on my phone that is going to distract me.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.020]   So what do I do when I'm bored?
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.340]   I'm at the table, I'm just sitting around the house waiting for someone to come over.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.460]   I've woken up early before my kids and I don't know what to do with myself.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.700]   I read.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.500]   Reading becomes my default activity when I don't have something else to do.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.740]   Now remember when Apple first introduced a few years ago that screen time feature, when
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.460]   it revealed to people how much time they were actually spending on their phone and everyone
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.580]   was surprised they were seeing two hours, three hours, four hours a day they were looking
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.700]   on their phone.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.660]   That is a lot of time.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.460]   We underestimate how much time we spend looking at those little glowing pieces of glass.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.580]   Imagine how much reading you get done if that two, three, four hours a day was diverted
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.940]   towards pages in a book.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.060]   Tell you what, five books a month no longer looks all that difficult.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.400]   So take everything interesting off your phone.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.660]   Take off the social media apps, take off the YouTube apps.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.700]   When you feel that itch of boredom or you have that downtime, just have a book nearby.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.380]   Retrain yourself to make reading your default activity.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.900]   Even if you do nothing else I advise in this video, that alone is going to skyrocket the
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.100]   amount of books you get through each month.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:33.660]   Oh, by the way, there's a side benefit to that as well because now that time that used
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.700]   to be spent on your phone is going somewhere not just more productive, but you are avoiding
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:45.140]   the anxiety, the stress, the addictive emotional manipulation that these apps are inflicting
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.340]   upon you every minute that you're looking at them.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.100]   So you gain a positive over here because you're going deep in a book, doing cognitive calisthenics,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.140]   building up that competitive advantage against everyone else who makes a living with their
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.900]   brain while at the same time avoiding a major source of negativity.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.420]   The difference between two hours spent on Twitter versus two hours spent grappling with
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:13.220]   Thoreau on the quality of your life is significant.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.620]   It's worth at least trying.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.940]   All right, so five books a month is not actually that crazy of a goal if you come at it the
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:21.940]   right way.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.660]   So let's just go down my five tips real quick.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:30.620]   Choose better books, schedule reading time like you would exercise, have good rituals
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.220]   surrounding your reading, do big closing pushes when you get within 100 pages of finishing
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.180]   a book and most importantly, make your phone boring so that reading can once again become
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:46.500]   your default leisure activity when bored.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.900]   The reading life is a deep life.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.300]   The reading life is a good life.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.740]   I recommend it.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.260]   Give it a try.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.840]   (upbeat music)
