[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We are about to begin day two of our conference for pastors here in downtown
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Minneapolis this morning, but the Ask Pastor John train keeps chugging,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   and we do our best to keep up with your excellent questions.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Today's question comes from Graham in Tennessee.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Pastor John, my question is this.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Is it wrong to have hobbies such as hunting, flying, shooting, climbing,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   or any number of other things that cost a decent amount of money
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   to be able to participate in?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   These things seem like something you would enjoy God's creation with,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   but it's also a lot of money not going towards missions.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So where do you draw the line?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Should we not do anything apart from those things strictly related to ministry,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   or maybe we enjoy other areas of life as well and split our money between the two?
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Oh, man.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I'm reading right now biographies and books about and by Hudson Taylor,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   the missionary, and I think Hudson Taylor would answer this with pretty blunt,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   "Come on, come on, come on.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Let's give our lives for this cause."
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So I have that ringing in my ears, and I don't want to soft pedal by being a
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   culturally adapting Christian, but here's what I think I need to say biblically.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Yes, some people waste their lives playing.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   They do.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Their whole life is jumping from one fun to the next.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's about all they know to talk about and all they spend their life thinking about.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's the next toy or the next vacation or the next stunt that they're going to be a part of.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And those people give little thought to the biblical truth that their life is not their own.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Paul said, "You're not your own, for you were bought with a price.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So glorify God with your body."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's like as if they do whatever they please with no reference to the one who owns them or bought them.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And those people need to hit pause in their life and ask, "Am I really born again?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Do I have any of the affections my Father in heaven has?"
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So to me then, if you operate from that verse, 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   then you ask about hobbies, whether outdoors or indoors,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   doesn't make any difference whether you collect coins or climb mountains.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You ask, "Is this the Lord's will for my life that He bought and He owns?"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And to answer that, you ask, "Am I glorifying Him in this hobby?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Is this hobby serving to make Him look glorious?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Is it making me look like one who values His glory above all?"
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Paul said, "Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink, whether you climb mountains or hunt deer or collect coins or do crossword puzzles,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   do it to the glory of God.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Make Him look like the treasure that He is in doing it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   If you can't, don't do it."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Now, how does that happen in hobbies or in leisure or in recreation?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And I'll just mention three ways.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   One, is the hobby, the leisure, the recreation, feeding your own soul with God-exalting experiences?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Do you see God in it and find your spirit enlivened for Him in it?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Or is it dragging you down?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Is it leaving you more distant from Him, more indifferent to Him,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   more in love with the world and less in love with Him?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's question one.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Question two, is the hobby, the leisure, the recreation refreshing you physically, emotionally, spiritually
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   for the other parts of your life where you need energy and focus to live for His glory as part of your vocation, perhaps, or your family?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Or is the hobby depleting you and weakening you and making you less able to do that part of your life to the glory of God?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's question two.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So here's three.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Are you involving others in your hobby, leisure, recreation, so that they're pointed to the glory of God?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Is your hobby a means of drawing others into your life for the sake of authentic relationships leading to Christ?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So it seems to me that those are the questions that are more prominent than the amount of time you spend
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   or the amount of money that you spend.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Time and money are a subset of those questions.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So instead of thinking quantitatively, quantities of time, quantities of money, think qualitatively,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   the quality of your walk with God.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And is the hobby deepening your walk with God and enhancing your witness to others?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yes, very good questions to think through.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And speaking of the Pastors Conference, which begins for us in a few minutes, today will be a very rich day.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I'm sure on the schedule are two messages from Sinclair Ferguson and two messages from Michael Horton.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And all four messages can be watched live online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You can also watch Pastor John's biography message of Hudson Taylor, which will air tomorrow morning, Wednesday morning,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   at about 9 a.m. Central Time, 10 a.m. Eastern.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   We hope you can tune in for that.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   See you tomorrow.
