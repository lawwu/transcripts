[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   - Do you think about your own mortality, death?
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Sure.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.920]   - Are you afraid of death?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.720]   - I released a theory during something
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.540]   that can kill older people, sure.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.880]   - Oh, is there a little bit of a parallel there?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.600]   - Of course, of course, I don't want it to die with me.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.940]   - What do you hope your legacy is?
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.820]   - Oh, I hope my legacy is accurate.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.900]   (laughs)
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.940]   I'd like to write on my accomplishments
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.760]   rather than how my community decided to ding me
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.460]   while I was alive, that would be great.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.740]   - What about if it was significantly exaggerated?
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.140]   - I don't want it.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.580]   - You want it to be accurate?
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.460]   - I've got some pretty terrific stuff
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.940]   and whether it works out or doesn't,
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.780]   I would like it to reflect what I actually was.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.580]   I'll settle for accurate.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.300]   - What would you say, what is the greatest element
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.980]   of Eric Weinstein accomplishment in life?
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.040]   In terms of being accurate, what are you most proud of?
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.980]   - Trying.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.620]   The idea that we were stalled out in the hardest field
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.860]   at the most difficult juncture
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.980]   and that I didn't listen to that voice ever
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.460]   that said, stop, you're hurting yourself,
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.980]   you're hurting your family, you're hurting everybody,
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.300]   you're embarrassing yourself, you're screwing up,
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.740]   you can't do this, you're a failure, you're a fraud,
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.640]   turn back, save yourself.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.820]   Like that voice, I didn't ultimately listen to it
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.580]   and it was going for 35, 37 years.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.820]   Very hard.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.300]   - And I hope you never listen to that voice.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.140]   - Well-- - That's why you're
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.740]   an inspiration. - Thank you, I appreciate that.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:38.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
