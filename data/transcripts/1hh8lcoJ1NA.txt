[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Congressman, how should we refer to you today?
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.040]   Well, I prefer Dean but you know,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.000]   let's go with Dean. Let's go with that Mr. Phillips.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   And just I'm asking people to be keen on Dean so I might as well
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.360]   run with it. Oh, there you go. Well, you know, I'm a big
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.080]   supporter of the Dean machine already. Oh, you know about the
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.440]   Dean machine with this gelato? I'm all up on the Dean machine.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.320]   By the way, I bought an old International Harvester Metro
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.880]   van for 20s when we did activations like South by
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.000]   Southwest. And I used to own one of those by the way. No, you did
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.320]   I yeah, I bought it for my ranch. Come on. I love that
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.600]   baby. So I bought one for 20. And I saw how people just
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   immediately were attracted to it and fell in love with it. And I
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.680]   thought, hey, when I ran for Congress, I'm gonna do the same
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.760]   thing. So I created the government repair truck.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.640]   Are you driving around in this international harvester? Of
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.560]   course. You're kidding. Yeah. I'll show you. I'll send you a
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.440]   picture of it. It's cool. It's awesome. It's got a 1980 Chevy
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.000]   chassis under it, but it's still the still the basic nuts and
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   bolts. We're referring to a type of automobile. You can ask one
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.600]   of your three drivers about it. David. Don't worry, David, your
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.480]   driver can take you in it. Ask your Miami driver. He probably
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.960]   owns some muscle cars. I don't think your LA driver owns muscle
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.440]   cars. Here we go. Let's start. Three, two
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.920]   Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to the all in podcast
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.440]   with us again today. The dictator himself to mouth
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.520]   polyhepate. The rain man David Sachs, and the Sultan of Science
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.320]   David Friedberg. We are going to continue our conversation series
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.480]   with presidential candidates today. Our fourth presidential
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.320]   candidate is on the program Dean Phillips represents Minnesota's
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.200]   third district. And he's about 25 years younger than Trump and
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.400]   Biden at 54 years old. Dean, before getting into politics, I
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.640]   understand you were the CEO of your family's spirits business
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.720]   and you ran to lenti gelato. Oh, pistachio flavor. Amazing. So
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.480]   welcome to the all in podcast meet the other besties. And
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.520]   maybe you could just start out by telling us why you are
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.720]   running for president.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.160]   Yeah, well, I'll tell you after being in the vodka business and
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.360]   the ice cream business and actually the coffee business, I
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.400]   think I understand at least what Americans want. So that's a good
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.720]   start. Well, I'll tell you a little about my background and
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.040]   why I'm here. I lost my dad in the Vietnam War, when I was just
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.320]   six months old. I had grew up with no money in St. Paul,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.640]   Minnesota, I earned an ROTC scholarship on behalf of the
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.480]   federal government, of course, to pursue his education, went to
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.680]   Vietnam in 1968, just before I was born, I got to see the US
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.080]   land on the moon. And I think regularly about how he looked up
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.880]   two days before his helicopter crashed and he died, looked up
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.520]   and saw Americans on the moon, and look down and saw America at
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.360]   its worst. And literally that experience, in no small way is
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.480]   what brings me to this day. And I was six months old, my mom was
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.000]   24 and widowed and we moved in with my great grandparents for
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.120]   the first three years of my life. And I got lucky when I was
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   three, my mom married a wonderful, extraordinary man who
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640]   adopted me, Eddie Phillips brought me into a family of
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.040]   great blessings. My grandmother became Dear Abby, and my aunt
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   Ann Landers, so I grew up in a family of a lot of advice. And
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.400]   I've lived on both sides of advantage, and I recognize it. I
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.520]   remember the day I turned 26. And I counted the days that my
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.280]   father had lived my birth father. And I remember the day
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.840]   after I had lived as many days as him, my life changed forever.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.800]   And I, I became inspired, joined our family business after
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.520]   college, ended up running our beverage business, we created
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.480]   Belvedere vodka, which we sold LVMH, and then got into the ice
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.800]   cream business and did the same thing.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.840]   You guys created Belvedere?
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.200]   Yeah, we my father and I and our partner, Steve Gill, went on a
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.520]   trip to Poland in 1993, hoping to sell them Phillips schnapps,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.240]   which we made in Minnesota, we thought Eastern Europe was ready
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.120]   for peppermint and peach schnapps. And we were touring
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   distilleries, and we see both in duty free in the airport and in
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.800]   the distilleries, the most beautiful packaging we'd ever
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.840]   seen in the spirits business. Now mind you, this is when
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.200]   Absolute and Stoli were like the pinnacle of luxury, $15, you
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.080]   know, average now. And my father immediately sat at a restaurant
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.600]   that night, literally, this is a literal napkin story, he on a
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.920]   napkin, created a little matrix and said, if Stoli and Absolute
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   are $15, and they're the most premium in a fast growing
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.000]   category, why shouldn't there be a $25 vodka? And why should this
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.280]   not be it? So we negotiated with the Polish government, our
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.880]   partner, Ted Dorda from Poland helped us. And we first obtained
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   the distribution rights. And then when Poland privatized
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.360]   their spirits industry, we acquired the distillery and the
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.720]   IP. And the rest was history. And you know, cork finish,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.400]   beautiful bottle, we sold it. We talked about the lowest common
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.040]   denominator, the pens we use to write the orders, the way we
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.400]   carried it made all the difference in the world. And
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.000]   then we use that same template in ice cream, because what we
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.480]   found is, in every category of every consumer product category
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.200]   in which there are two main competitors, Coke and Pepsi,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.280]   Stoli, Absolute, Ben and Jerry's and Haagen Dazs, they tend to
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   fight to the bottom, lower pricing, you know, frankly,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.400]   demeaning consumers. And there's always an opportunity to
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.640]   introduce something a little bit more premium, a little bit more
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.120]   special, that's still an affordable luxury. And Belvedere,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.840]   by the way, was built by Jay Z. I can tell you that story, if
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.400]   you want to hear it, it's an extraordinary one.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.640]   Yeah, tell that story. Yeah.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.760]   Yeah. So, so far, you're like, you're our kind of candidate.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.360]   We're like, exactly. Yeah, you just got
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   we're all looking at you like, who is this guy?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.080]   So when people ask me about my platform, I'll say I'll be a
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   storyteller about vodka.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.640]   I'm ready to start popping bottles over here.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.440]   By the way, that's exactly what Jay Z did.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.520]   Sax and I popped many a Belvedere bottle in when we had
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.440]   our run in LA. True or not true, Sax?
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.720]   It was a tough choice between Belvedere and Grey Goose.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.360]   Oh, I'll tell you that story too, by the way. Anyway, so
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   we introduced Belvedere and it and.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.120]   By the way, what we learned in hindsight is that our aperture
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.200]   was way too small.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.040]   You know, we were way too we sold it by the bottle, not by
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.360]   the case. We only went to restaurants and bars at first,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   not to the big stores.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.600]   We wanted to be special and we completely underestimated the
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.280]   size of what this category could be.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.240]   Sidney Frank, who introduced Grey Goose, took a much bigger
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   approach. Anyway, so I'm sitting at home getting ready for work
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.800]   one day. I have MTV on and it's probably a year after we
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.960]   introduced Belvedere. It's doing well, but not not big.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.080]   So sorry, this is mid 90s.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.560]   Yeah, I can't remember the year, Chamath.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.400]   It's probably, you know, 95.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.160]   Yeah, 90s thereabouts.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.120]   I'm watching MTV. I see a Jay-Z video and it is all Belvedere.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   It's in the fridge. He's holding it.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.960]   There are people dancing.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   He's pouring it on him.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.200]   And I froze, called my dad immediately, who, of course,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.720]   didn't have MTV on.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.320]   And and I said, you got to turn it on.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.160]   He couldn't find the channel.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.560]   I'm like, hey, dad, you know, MTV repeats the same videos, you
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.920]   know, five, ten times a day.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.160]   So we got to the office and sure enough, we had the TV on.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.040]   It came back on.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.600]   The whole company gathered at that time.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.800]   We were probably 10 people and we gathered around the TV and
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.720]   watched this video.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.280]   And I'm telling you guys, within two weeks, the brand completely
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.000]   popped. And my dad, Jay-Z, ended up calling my father.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.520]   They had a dinner in New York City, a memorable one for both.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.480]   Actually, he ended up introducing a vodka some years later called
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.280]   Armadale. And it failed miserably.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.480]   But it was one of the first times that I think in this new
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.320]   culture of influencers and celebrity endorsers that that magic
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.760]   happened. He almost literally made Belvedere.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.120]   So that's the story.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.640]   Did you guys sign into a deal and pay him money or?
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.160]   No, no.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.680]   In fact, we talked about that.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.800]   And the so this is the brand foundation of the brand house was
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.640]   authenticity. We didn't do a damn thing that had anything to do
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.000]   with anything that wasn't true.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.840]   The makers of it, the product itself.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.880]   We didn't we didn't pay people to talk about it, unlike Sidney
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.200]   Frank with Grey Goose.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.640]   So we chose not to.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.720]   It was all natural.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.280]   And then here's the other cool thing.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.120]   And this is how my campaign is going to work.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   We sent 200 bottles in very special, beautiful boxes to 200
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.160]   influencers. We believe that if we could simply seed the brand
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   with 200 people all around the U.S., that they could be the
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.960]   content makers and the advocates, the ambassadors.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.560]   In fact, one of them went to this guy right behind me, Bill
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.960]   Oakland and Robert De Niro.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   Another example, Robert Redford, leaders of industry and actors
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.720]   and and and the like.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   Robert De Niro gets one of these things and there is a note
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.600]   inside with a picture of the distiller Bogdan Zalensky.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.760]   It said, Watch page three, the Tiffany section.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   I'm sorry, the Tiffany location of The Wall Street Journal on
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.640]   call. It was like Monday, February 6th to only 200 people
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.400]   knew what was coming.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.160]   The ad in the paper didn't show a bottle of anything.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.560]   It just said Belvedere.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   Bogdan wants to know how you like it.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.480]   So we literally did an ad that cost gosh knows back then
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.240]   probably one hundred thousand dollars, tiny little top corner
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.480]   ad that spoke to 200 people in the United States of America
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.760]   that had no idea. Nobody else knew what it was.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.720]   Robert De Niro goes to the Beverly Hills Hotel or the
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.120]   Peninsula. I can't remember.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.320]   Orders a Belvedere martini soon thereafter.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.440]   The barman says, Mr. De Niro, we have Absolute, we have Stoli.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.560]   I don't have that brand.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   And he says, I don't think you heard me.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.440]   I want a Belvedere martini.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.040]   So the barman sends like the bar back to whatever the wine
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.440]   and spirit shop is on Rodeo Driver in Beverly Hills.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.320]   And the guy, he comes back with a bottle.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.160]   And the entire bar watched this little episode.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.360]   And I'm telling you once again, within a week, that store was
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.160]   selling through Belvedere like it was water.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.400]   So these little moments where you identify the right people.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.200]   And now mind you, this is in the analog era.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.080]   There was no Internet. There was no social media.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.840]   This was people simply talking to people.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.160]   So we sold Belvedere to LVMH and then we looked at the ice
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.080]   cream category.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   Saab Benajiri is doing the same thing.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.320]   If you can tell us about that, what is it like to negotiate
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.600]   against LVMH and Bernard Arnault?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.960]   And why do you sell it when it's working?
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.080]   I guess maybe it's a question.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.440]   You know, I'll tell you, well, this is not a story I've shared
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440]   with many.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.640]   They were very disingenuous.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.400]   And it deeply troubles me to this day.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.600]   The way that my father was treated, the promises that were
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.240]   made simply to get a deal done and then not kept, I think is a
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.400]   reflection on principle.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   And I'll leave it at that.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.720]   A lesson learned.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.080]   In fact, rather than going through a competitive process,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   which I think any enterprise would do to maximize value of a
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.320]   brand, our family ethos was a little different.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.800]   And I think we bit.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.280]   And in hindsight, it was a mistake.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.240]   But I'll leave it at that.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.080]   You learn less.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.920]   You know what?
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   You learn lessons every experience to this very day.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.640]   I'm learning them every day on the campaign trail to that was
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.040]   one I would never make again.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.120]   All right, well, you got the two David's votes with the vodka.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.280]   You got mine with the gelato.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.360]   And if you launch a luxury fabric brand or sweaters, I think
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.320]   you're going to get your first.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.720]   I got some other work to do for eight years.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.160]   So we'll do that afterwards.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.800]   I'll just wrap this long story up.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.760]   So we introduced, you know, plenty obviously does well.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.440]   We sold it to Unilever.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.840]   Then I opened a couple of coffee shops with my family in
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.360]   Minneapolis thinking this would be kind of a fun folly.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.880]   And then we're watching the 2016 election at home.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.480]   I thought I would wake up the next morning.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.360]   We'd have Hillary Clinton as president.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.200]   Not that that was thrilling to the world, but it would have
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.160]   been safe and lo and behold, you know what happened.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.440]   And I remember telling my family that night, like, look,
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.400]   give the guy a chance.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.280]   He's not going to act like that in the White House.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.720]   The presidency changes you.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.800]   It humbles you.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.400]   It moderates you.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.560]   And my family thought I was a, you know, I was a joke.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.680]   And I woke up the next morning.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.480]   My 16 year old was in her room crying.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.680]   My 18 year old was a freshman at college.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.160]   We FaceTimed her and she's crying.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   And I sat at the breakfast table, guys, and I promised my
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.720]   daughters I would do something.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.440]   I raised them to be participants, not observers.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.760]   And I looked around at my district.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.080]   I thought maybe I'll run for Congress.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.880]   I looked around and I had, the district had not been won by a
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.440]   Democrat since the 1958 election.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.840]   This is the, now we're looking at the 2018 election, 60 years.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.120]   And the man who had won, won his fourth term by 14 points.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.800]   And people told me I was crazy.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.680]   You know, you're out of your mind.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.000]   You're giving up a good life to run for misery and you'll never
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.960]   make it and you'll embarrass yourself,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.080]   which is why I did it.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.280]   And not only did we win, we won by 12 points.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.120]   We had fun.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.440]   We used invitation, not confrontation.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.280]   And I drove that little van all around the district to the most
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.480]   unhospitable parts.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   I opened the service window.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.520]   I served coffee and I sat, I put two chairs out and people
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.160]   would just come up and talk.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.560]   And I found magic in just letting people share what's on
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.400]   their mind.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.240]   They're so unheard.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.960]   Anyhow, I get to, well, I can tell you now,
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.000]   I want to tell you why I'm doing it,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.640]   but that's the story of where I came from and why I'm doing
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.160]   this and look at the end of the day,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.520]   I'm the one of those that got lucky.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.560]   You know, there's a lot of kids who lost their dads in
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.880]   Vietnam, who did not have the magical moment that I had to be
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.760]   adopted by an amazing father.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   And that was the difference for me.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.880]   It's my job to make sure others get that same chance.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.040]   Simple as that.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.880]   - Before we jump into the future,
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   but why you're running and what you,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.040]   what you see for the country,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   talk about the years that you spent in Congress.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.320]   What did you observe there?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.200]   What, what is it like day to day?
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.000]   And what do you think is working and what isn't working?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.640]   - I wish we had three hours.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.920]   I get there, Chamath, I get there the first week of 2019.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.760]   And like all of you that come from organizational enterprise
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.800]   experience, I assume that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.760]   would have a, have a strategy to introduce the new members
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.960]   of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.880]   you know, get to know each other, do a ropes course,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.120]   you know, and build some trust or something.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.320]   And my goodness, it was just the opposite guys.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   We were put on separate buses, going to different events.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.480]   And I realized right away that they had a systemic
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.560]   segregation strategy on day one.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.480]   And I mean, sincerely, the two parties, this is,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.600]   I'll tell you what I've learned.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.200]   We can talk more about this.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.720]   The only people that want to protect the status quo of the
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.360]   duopoly and the political industrial complex that just
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.600]   surrounds it all are the two parties.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.040]   And it is destructive and I will get into that.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.000]   But I recognize right away, all of my colleagues,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.520]   that the leadership in both Democratic and Republican side,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.120]   they wanted to keep us separate.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.680]   They did not want to give us education and information.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.040]   And they wanted to keep us so busy that we could not become
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.800]   threats to their power structure.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.840]   You can imagine, members of Congress tend to be pretty
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.000]   ambitious people.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.640]   And ultimately they were smart to do that because
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.560]   they made members of Congress, they do this day,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.240]   raise money all week long.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.160]   10,000 hours per week is what senators and house members
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.880]   spend raising money.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.640]   I've got a bill actually that would preclude it from 8 a.m.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.840]   to 5 p.m.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.240]   'cause it's such an unmitigated joke and disaster.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.400]   The fact that in the United States,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.600]   that a PAC representing a special interest or corporation
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.800]   can hand a $5,000 check to a member of Congress at a
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.360]   steakhouse on Wednesday evening,
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.400]   and then that member serves on a committee in which that
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.960]   business or special interest has business in front of the
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.240]   next day, is the most unbelievable form of legal corruption
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   you could possibly imagine.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.400]   So that's one.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.640]   Needless to say, I resolved right after that first week of
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.480]   orientation that I would do it differently.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.840]   I befriended my Republican colleagues.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.440]   My wife Annalise and I started having bipartisan dinners
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.560]   at our house.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.040]   I joined the Problem Solvers Caucus.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.080]   I hope you guys know about it.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.560]   It's the most important small caucus in Congress.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.920]   We're now 32 Democrats and 32 Republicans committed to doing
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.240]   what we're supposed to do.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.640]   Get to know each other, talk policy,
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.680]   and try to make a difference.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.200]   Now we're the workhorses, not the show horses,
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.600]   so you don't know most of our names, including me.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.880]   But we were the ones invited to the White House
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   in like week three of our service.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.120]   I was one of four Democrats.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.080]   There were four Republicans that President Trump invited to
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.520]   the Situation Room to make a proposition to get us through
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.640]   the shutdown, which I can talk about that bizarre hour
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.920]   of my life as well.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.800]   And that's how I resolved to do it.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.600]   Now I'm ranked, depending on the survey,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.880]   number one, number two, number 10,
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.960]   most bipartisan members of the entire U.S. Congress
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   and including governors.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.880]   And I vote relatively progressive.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.320]   It's not about just the votes, it's about the ethos.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.800]   It's about Republican sponsored bills that come from me.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.520]   It's about me sponsoring Republican led bills.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.800]   And that's what makes me a little bit different than I think
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.240]   just about every member of Congress, not to mention,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.920]   I think I'm the only one that's willing to torpedo a career
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.160]   so that the country isn't torpedoed by this nonsense
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.080]   and dysfunction.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.880]   There's a lot more to talk about, but it all starts
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.160]   with a systematic segregation and a focus on fighting
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.880]   each other instead of fighting for each other.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.600]   I can talk about it all day long.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.240]   - Let's start there, Dean.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.840]   Give us the assessment of what's happening
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.080]   in the White House right now.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.440]   Before we talk about your candidacy,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.280]   just like what's going on?
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.120]   - Well, let me just say, I respect President Biden.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.520]   He's a man I've had in my house for an event.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.800]   He's a man with whom I've flown on Air Force One twice.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.760]   He did a beautiful video for my daughter.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.080]   He called my mother.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.360]   I think he did a fine job.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.520]   I think he was the only man that could have defeated
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.200]   Donald Trump in 2020.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.960]   And I have to say, I think it's fair to say too,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.480]   he's probably the only Democrat who could and will lose
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.920]   to Donald Trump in 2024.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.560]   He's a human being.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.480]   He's now in his 80s.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.520]   He is clearly on the decline.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.000]   He's not incompetent.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.120]   I believe he's surrounded himself by competent,
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.800]   able, principled people.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.560]   And I believe the White House is running as a team,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.080]   as most do.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.120]   But do I think that he will be in a position
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.280]   to continue leading this country in the future?
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.360]   I do not.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.400]   I think I'm joined by about 75% of the country
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.240]   in saying that.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.960]   I also believe the policies that we pass,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.560]   for the most part, are investments for the future.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.200]   In infrastructure, the CHIPS Act,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.080]   I think is a very important bill,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   which by the way, has national security implications,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.240]   as you guys know.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.800]   The Inflation Reduction Act, a bizarre name for a bill
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.880]   that's really an energy and climate bill,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.480]   I think is pretty good legislation.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.640]   And I think he reconstituted our allies around the world
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.160]   that had been frayed to a point of great danger
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.680]   during the Trump administration.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.360]   So I salute the past,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.760]   but this is really an election about the future.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.040]   It's about a generational change.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.600]   It's about creating, you know,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.240]   really a new American century
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.160]   that will be powered by systems, structures,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.200]   people, technologies,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.120]   that I'm just afraid that President Biden
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.200]   and former President Trump can't even comprehend,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.040]   let alone create thoughtful policy
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.320]   to both nurture and also manage.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.560]   And I think that's where we're at.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.160]   And I think we have wars overseas
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.800]   that I think in no small part are caused by a generation
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.320]   that is so focused on techniques and tools of the past
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.640]   that they can't even dare look
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.480]   to building peace for the future.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.160]   That's I think why we have the Middle East still going.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.960]   That's why Ukraine, you know,
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.080]   the Vice President has some ownership
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.320]   in some of these issues that I'm afraid have to be exposed
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.160]   and they're the truth.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.240]   And I'm happy to talk about them.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.400]   But most of all, I'll wrap it with this.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.040]   Affordability in the United States of America
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.280]   is absolutely the most challenging issue facing Americans.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.400]   They don't believe that their government is listening.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.680]   They don't believe the President understands.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.320]   They don't believe Congress is able to do anything about it
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.200]   'cause we're so dysfunctional.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.280]   And that's another mission that I'm on right now.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.200]   To end this nonsense, I am gonna build a team of rivals.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.920]   I will have a White House and a cabinet comprised
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.920]   of both Democrats and Republicans,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.360]   the most able leaders imaginable
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.480]   who have run multi-billion dollar organizations
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.920]   in some cases, understand customer service.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.440]   We'll employ zero-based budgeting to the extent we can.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.100]   We will employ a world-class consulting firm
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.520]   to look at every single government program,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.320]   system, structure, and personnel
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.640]   to identify ways to save money.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.320]   These are things that this President,
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.040]   and frankly, no President,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   who doesn't have business experience,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.760]   nonprofit leadership experience,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.160]   and government experience could possibly imagine
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.680]   'cause they're so stuck in their siloed ways of thinking.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   He's been there for 50 years and it's time for change.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.520]   I was three years old when he became a Senator.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.120]   - So let's get specific on the issues
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.880]   and go into foreign policy, which is David Sachs's,
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.640]   I think, number one issue of this election.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.480]   - Of course. - But first,
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.720]   just to be clear on Biden,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.120]   do you believe he's in cognitive decline?
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.160]   Do the Democrats privately believe he's in cognitive decline?
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.400]   And to what extent?
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.160]   Do you think he'd make it through the next presidency?
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.120]   Or do you think this is sort of a Ronald Reagan situation
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.040]   where he might look back on it
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.600]   and he's got some early onset of some cognitive decline?
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.280]   What do you personally think and what do Democrats think?
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.920]   - I don't want to impress upon anybody
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.360]   or give you the sense that I think he has a form of dementia
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.500]   or Alzheimer's or significant cognitive decline.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.920]   But anybody who pays attention can see the change.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.760]   And I'm not, you know, people are saying
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.700]   that I'm causing his problems,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.360]   I could risk his re-election.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.160]   I'm not the guy that has him losing to Trump nationally
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.120]   down in five of six battleground states,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.280]   the lowest approval ratings in presidential history almost.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.400]   And I'm certainly not the guy that has shown his,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.460]   you know, his decline.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.480]   That's on video, that's on audio, you see it, it's natural.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.320]   He's a human being for goodness sakes.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.960]   All I'm doing you guys is saying the quiet part out loud.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.280]   The only one.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.420]   You asked the question, do others talk about this?
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.760]   The question is, is anybody not talking about this?
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.120]   Of course they are, you guys.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.720]   - They've really created an opportunity for you
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.080]   because like you said, everyone's talking about this,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.440]   but no one's willing to say it.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.280]   - Of course.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.200]   - What has been the blowback in the Democratic Party
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.440]   from your declaring?
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.080]   - What do you think?
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.800]   I'm not being thrown flowers and parties,
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.640]   let me tell you that.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.460]   Guys, I'll tell you,
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.000]   I think most would consider me an affable, friendly,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.160]   well-liked member of Congress, I know that.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.340]   That's my ethos.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.400]   My friends are still my friends.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.320]   I think they're disappointed because this is not
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.120]   what you do when you're a member of a party.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.520]   You fall in line, you shush up, you sit down,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.800]   you get in line, and you do nothing to upset the apple cart
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.500]   of others who've been waiting in line,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.120]   perhaps a little longer than you.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.200]   So you can imagine the pushback has been strong,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.560]   the arrow's sharp, and the pain quite significant,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.120]   but nothing compared to the pain that Americans
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.800]   are feeling right now, and that's why I'm doing this.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.280]   And I should also let you know,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.200]   I had no intention of doing this.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.860]   A year ago, I was on a radio show and a host asked me
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.840]   if I thought the president should run again.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.200]   And I said, of course not.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.800]   He implicitly, if not explicitly, said he would be
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.380]   a transitional president, kind of the bridge.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.800]   Most members of Congress thought he was going to stand down.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   That's why Newsom and Pritzker and Whitmer
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.440]   and so many others were kind of making their plans.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.260]   And I said, and if he doesn't pass the torch,
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.620]   then we should ensure that at least that the stage
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.480]   has newer generation candidates to give voters a choice.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.840]   Anyway, months went by, I started seeing the polls
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.120]   change dramatically, the tenor and tone
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.680]   of constituent discussions with me and every single one
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.480]   of my colleagues was changing graphically.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.280]   All the independents, moderate Republicans
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.840]   that voted for the president, I think for the right reasons,
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.640]   were increasingly telling us that they're not
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.480]   gonna do it again.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.560]   They may not vote for Trump, but they're not gonna vote
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.200]   rather than vote for Biden.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.720]   And over time, it got to a point actually, guys,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.080]   where I resigned from the House leadership table
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.040]   because my position was so incongruent
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.720]   with those who were in positions to do something about it
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.840]   that I didn't feel it was appropriate for me
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.900]   to sit with them anymore.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.480]   And I was really frustrated.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.320]   I called Gretchen Whitmer, I called J.B. Pritzker,
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.200]   I made public calls to the candidates
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.840]   whose names are better known than me to jump in.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.080]   You know, the water's warm, you guys,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.320]   it's a democratic primary, that's what we do.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.840]   Not only did those two not take my calls,
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.520]   which they would have any other day,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.300]   they had their political operatives take those calls
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   and they told me, "Please don't use their names."
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.380]   That's the culture, that's the culture, you guys,
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.340]   that we're dealing with.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.220]   You will be blackballed, you will be disenfranchised,
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.140]   you will be let out the door if you so much
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.020]   as even issue a word that you might challenge
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.580]   a sitting president of the United States.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.620]   This is the United States of America, it's appalling.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.460]   Anyhow, I'm frustrated.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.340]   - We saw that happen with R.K. Jr.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.580]   - Sure, sure. - Because he declared,
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.060]   initially as a Democrat, and Biden wouldn't give him
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.300]   secret service protection despite the enormous
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.820]   personal safety risks and threats.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.660]   He's actually had threats. - Which is the same thing
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.020]   for me, by the way, guys, you can imagine.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.700]   - Yeah, and-- - Biggest line item
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.660]   in my budget right now, by the way, is security.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.620]   The biggest line item, the second biggest line item
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.500]   that's gonna surpass that is getting onto the ballot.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.380]   - Right, well, that was the thing,
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.700]   is they wouldn't let R.K. on the ballot,
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.100]   they wouldn't debate him, they just wanted to pretend
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.660]   like he didn't exist and they basically drove him
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.340]   out of the party, so now he's running as an independent.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.060]   Do you think you're gonna be able to get on the ballot
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.380]   as a Democrat in these primaries?
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.540]   - Absolutely, and we're making those choices right now,
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.820]   David, because first of all, it's obscene.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.020]   I wanna let you all know that in a country
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.900]   that prides itself on being a democracy,
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.780]   a democratic republic, I can't even tell you
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.880]   how many states literally create high barriers to entry
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.140]   to satisfy the two parties to ensure
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.020]   that their coronated candidate has an advantage
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.540]   over anybody else.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.580]   I'm talking about-- - They're the most
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.900]   egregious ones, give us an example of what you have to do.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.500]   - Oh, the most egregious are oftentimes the deepest blue.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.300]   New York is close to impossible.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.340]   When I say impossible-- - How so?
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.460]   Explain it to us, like what you have to do.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.500]   - So the reason I started in New Hampshire
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.420]   is it has a 103-year-old tradition
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.980]   of being the first in the nation primary.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.500]   They take this really seriously.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.820]   They're the most engaged Americans in the country.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.620]   They have a process, we walk through the snow,
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.100]   we answer their questions, and you also,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.580]   all you need is a $1,000 check,
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.220]   you gotta be 35 years old,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.620]   you gotta be born in the United States of America,
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.940]   and you too can become a candidate
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.320]   for president of the United States.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.160]   That's what I did.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.000]   They have the most beautiful ritual
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.700]   in the Statehouse in Concord, New Hampshire
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.140]   that is worth going to one time just to see the majesty
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   of filing for president of the United States.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.500]   So there are 21 of us on the democratic side of the ballot
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.460]   because that's how it should be.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.460]   Take a state like Virginia-- - Wait, wait, hold on.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.460]   There's 21 people running for the democratic,
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.060]   but that's incredible, I had no idea.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.460]   - Yeah, Chamath, 21, Marion, Williamson, and I
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.520]   are the best known of those 21
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.520]   because the president of the United States chose not to.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.460]   So that's how you have it.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.440]   You ask about other states though.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.440]   New York, Virginia, $450,000 to $500,000
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.540]   to pay consulting firms, to pay people $25, $26 per signature
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.420]   to just sit outside and just say,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.500]   "Hey, can we get your signature to get this guy on a ballot?"
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.820]   It's not grassroots,
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.620]   it's not old school caucusing democracy.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.260]   It is pay to play.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.140]   And we would need it, we would need,
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.340]   well, we're going to have to raise probably six,
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.460]   yeah, maybe, I'm sorry, maybe less than that,
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.140]   maybe $5 million.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.020]   We have a staff of three people right now
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.020]   and legal counsel just to get my name on a primary ballot.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.540]   It's absurd.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.900]   Marion Williamson, she's not going to be able to.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.220]   RFK as an independent, by the way, I think he should be.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.500]   I'm not someone who I'm concerned about
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.380]   some of his positions,
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.380]   but I think he should be able to get on the ballot.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.140]   You guys, it's absurd, it's obnoxious.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.180]   And what I've discovered in the last three weeks
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.340]   is going to be my mission after being president to fix
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.400]   because it is going to destroy the country from the inside.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.060]   And that is why we have the kind of candidates
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.780]   we have year after year after year and Americans say they're,
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.100]   and that's why we have Trumpism.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.660]   - I like the fact that, - Of course.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.820]   - You know, most people become politicians as a career.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.300]   I've harped against this for a while.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.780]   And so they have everything to lose
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.600]   if they stand up against the party
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.260]   and they stand up against the political establishment
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.740]   within which they're meant to operate.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.060]   And therefore just a few people get to make all the decisions
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.060]   and control all the levers
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.100]   and everyone else is just a marionette.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.340]   But you have- - And they stay there forever,
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.900]   Dave, they stay there forever.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.740]   And there's no term limits, which is what we need.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.780]   That's why we need them.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.600]   - The fact that you're self-made
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.700]   and you don't have anything to lose.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.500]   You can leave Congress and you'll be fine.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.140]   You're a citizen that can go back to work
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.780]   and do what you do.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.100]   And you're doing this as a service,
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.980]   you're doing this because of your interest in the country,
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.140]   it sounds like, not to say that other folks don't,
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.820]   but they're largely gonna be driven
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.340]   and unfortunately adversely affected by the fact
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.500]   that they have to fall within the way
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.540]   that the game is played in order to operate
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.580]   and will not stand up and say the things
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.260]   that need to be said in order for us to make progress
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.500]   and get out of these situations.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.940]   But- - Those are the perverse
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.780]   incentives, exactly. - I commend you for doing it.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.940]   I'm glad it's possible.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.220]   I think, Jason, we should probably talk about the topic.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.900]   - We have two topics that I think
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.740]   we're all passionate here.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.820]   The first is foreign policy,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.540]   the second is the budget and our out of control spending.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.820]   Let's start with Sachs.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.100]   You said you wanted hard questions.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.980]   Welcome to the pod, Sachs, foreign policy.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.820]   Let's go. - I'd love nothing more.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.660]   Let's bring it. - Before we get on,
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.860]   you've said hard questions, let's go.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.180]   - Please. - Meet David Sachs.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.020]   - Hey, David.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.980]   - Dean, you said a minute ago that
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.100]   one of the reasons why the world's on fire
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.500]   is because of the Biden administration's handling
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.420]   of foreign policy has kind of led us to this point.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.500]   I think there was a really good example of this.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.940]   A week ago, there was a new report out
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.740]   by a former UN assistant secretary general
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.860]   named Michael von der Schulenburg
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.100]   who worked at the UN for 34 years.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.740]   He did a detailed study and reconstruction
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.260]   of what happened in March of 2022.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.140]   So the month after the war.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.980]   And what he concluded is there was a bona fide deal
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.660]   on the table between Russia and Ukraine
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.180]   where Putin was willing to pull back and leave
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.180]   and leave the territorial integrity of Ukraine intact
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.580]   if Ukraine would agree not to become part of NATO.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.900]   And this is something that's been discussed.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.580]   There've been many reports of this
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.660]   over the last several months.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.460]   Ukrainian Pravda had a story about that.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.060]   But now there's yet another confirmation
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.180]   that such a deal was available.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.780]   And yet Boris Johnson and Joe Biden said,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.780]   "No, we wanna pressure Putin
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.700]   "not work out a peace deal with him."
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.820]   And so thanks to Western intervention,
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.180]   that deal never happened.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.760]   Now we're 20 months later
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.780]   and the Ukrainian counter offensive has failed.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.740]   It's been a fiasco.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.380]   The casualties have been absolutely massive.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.220]   Horrifying.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.900]   You saw there was this article on Time Magazine,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.060]   this new profile of Zelensky
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.860]   where his own aides and advisors say
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:47.940]   that he's delusional.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.700]   He can't accept that they're losing the war.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.460]   They furthermore say that even if the US
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.380]   provides more weapons, more aid,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.780]   they don't have enough men,
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.340]   they don't have enough soldiers to use them.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.340]   Things are going that badly.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.840]   I think there's now a fear
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.580]   that Ukraine could collapse in the next year
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.140]   even if we provide more aid.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.620]   So I guess, I know that early on in the war
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.960]   you supported Biden's policy.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.940]   I'm wondering, have events on the ground now
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.300]   changed your view at all?
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.460]   How do you feel about it today?
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.780]   Do you think it was a mistake not to try
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.260]   and work out a peace deal
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.220]   in those early months of the war?
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.540]   And if you were president,
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.260]   what would you try and do differently now
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.900]   to try and end this thing?
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.480]   - Well, first of all, I think we have to back up to 2014
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.780]   to talk about this, David.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.540]   First of all, I've seen that reporting.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.200]   I do not have confirmation of the validity of that.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.840]   And if I did, I could talk about it more directly.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.700]   But if that's the truth,
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.540]   I would first ask, did that include Crimea?
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.260]   And secondly, it's not a United States decision
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.780]   about whether or not Ukraine should agree to a peace deal.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.780]   It is Ukraine's decision, plain and simple.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.700]   But I do wanna turn back the clock a little bit
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.660]   'cause I think this all kind of plays together.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.580]   - But by the way, it didn't include Crimea.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.500]   But Zelensky was willing to go for that deal.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.460]   And it was the West who intervened and said,
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.940]   "No, we want you to pressure Putin and fight."
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.980]   - David, like I said, I never speak to,
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.260]   unless I can verify that myself.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.580]   And I've not seen that intelligence in the SCIF.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.300]   I've not seen that presented to me.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.740]   If, and by the way, there are some times
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.500]   where I don't know, most times,
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   none of us know everything.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.660]   If that is the case,
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.700]   I would absolutely answer this question differently.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.700]   But based on what I do know,
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.980]   I wanna turn back the clock to 2014.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.260]   This is where foreign policy matters.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.300]   President Obama was a great orator,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.700]   I think an inspirational leader.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.340]   He came to the US presidency
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.020]   with only organizing state legislative
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.100]   and a couple or few years of Senate experience
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.500]   as a very young man.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.740]   And Joe Biden was his vice president.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.740]   And when Vladimir Putin took Crimea easily,
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.460]   you know, that set the tone for what's going on right now.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:58.300]   And we have not done a very good job of prevention.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.900]   That's true in healthcare.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.340]   That is true in poverty.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.420]   That is true in our foreign policy,
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.980]   which is, by the way, maybe what happens
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.700]   when you spend 83 billion a year on diplomacy
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.140]   and 850 billion a year on bombs and missiles.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.220]   Not to mention, go back to Eisenhower
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.140]   and the military industrial complex, David,
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.340]   now you well know this.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.780]   It does, it controls a lot of our policy
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.060]   because those who are making great profit
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.940]   find ways to influence those who open the piggy banks.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.500]   I think the Crimea moment in 2014,
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.820]   the writing was on the wall,
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.140]   that was Putin's test.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.860]   If I take an inch, maybe they'll give me a mile.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.940]   And what happened during the Biden presidency,
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.660]   of course, he took the mile.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.660]   I think it has implications now, though, David,
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.620]   and all of you.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.940]   You know, if we do not do our best
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.980]   to support Ukraine in defending,
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.980]   I think it doesn't just send a message to Putin,
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.500]   a post-Putin Russia, which is gonna be a failed nation
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.900]   with a brain drain and something we should talk about,
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.980]   but it also sends a message to Iran, North Korea,
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.860]   and even China.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.060]   And I wanna talk about that too,
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.500]   because I think we have a much brighter future with them
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.620]   than most people portray, as it relates to Taiwan.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.620]   And that's the sad truth,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.180]   is we get ourselves into these situations
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.100]   that then layer up the consequences by withdrawing.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.900]   And Afghanistan was another example of that.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.180]   So to answer your question,
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.660]   had there been a peace deal at that point,
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.620]   that simply would have, and the deal would have been,
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.420]   we'll give you your territory back
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.580]   in return for not entering NATO,
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.740]   who in their right mind would say that was a bad deal?
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.780]   Who in their right mind?
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.620]   Especially-
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.780]   - Boris Johnson.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.180]   - Well, by the way, that's what you get
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.140]   when you get people like,
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.980]   well, I'm gonna make this case, as you guys know,
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.660]   for comprehensive new generation of leaders
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.460]   all around the world in our country
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.540]   and in others that are sick of this nonsense,
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.260]   sick of the bloodshed, sick of enriching enterprise
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.740]   at the expense of human beings.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.380]   It happens here, it happens in Ukraine and Russia,
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.180]   and it's happening in the Middle East, plain and simple.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:57.020]   - Sax, anything else on foreign policy you wanna go to?
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.460]   - Packing off now would be, I think,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.820]   a shameful, horrible mistake.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.060]   The one thing I would argue right now, David,
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.620]   is those who are most likely going to be subject
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.020]   to Putin's terror, the countries in Europe,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.540]   should be carrying a much bigger part of this load.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.500]   We have 750 bases and installations
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.300]   around the world in 80 countries.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.900]   We are the most dominant presence
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.300]   in world history of any government,
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.420]   and we spend more on our military than the next,
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.340]   I think, 11 nations combined, for gosh sakes.
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.860]   And if anyone thinks that a kinetic risk
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.260]   to the United States is the most likely harm
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.740]   that will be done us, not cyber or not social
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.940]   or not biological, I think you're out of your mind.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.700]   Those are the risks that I think are most threatening
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.340]   that I think this president does not quite understand,
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.380]   and we have to recomprise and recommit to diplomacy
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.620]   and defending ourselves against the most important
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.660]   literal risks, including nuclear weapons
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.460]   that can be carried in a backpack
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.980]   and detonated in New York or Tel Aviv
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.140]   or anywhere in the world.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.060]   And if we don't start changing how we do things,
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.340]   we're not going to be ready,
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.980]   and we are just sitting still in dysfunction.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.060]   I'm gonna change it.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.540]   - Let's talk about China for one second,
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.460]   and I'll give it to you in two arcs.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.020]   Arc number one, the comments that President Xi
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.100]   made yesterday, which were very,
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.740]   if you just heard them or read them, were very specific.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.180]   We have zero desire to seek Chinese hegemony.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   We have zero desire to find a cold or hot war,
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.460]   but then there was what wasn't said,
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.860]   which is part of what you said, which is, well,
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.420]   okay, maybe there's no kinetic war,
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.620]   but the cyber risk is still there,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.460]   and actually the psychological war risk is there.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.740]   So two questions.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:53.540]   One is how do you react to what President Xi said last night?
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.380]   And then the second is how do you react to what's happening
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.660]   with this TikTok Osama Bin Laden psyop thing
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.980]   that just seems to be, frankly,
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.300]   just getting out of control here?
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.180]   - I agree.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.220]   Well, let me say I was so pleased
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.940]   to see President Xi's remarks.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.820]   I think President Biden responded by saying
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.060]   we should trust but verify.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.500]   I think that's appropriate.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.140]   I was troubled, though, when a question was shouted out
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.500]   to President Biden on his way out
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.860]   about whether he considered President Xi a dictator,
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.500]   and he said, yes, he's a dictator,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.540]   and I think that may have undermined this entire rapprochement,
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.620]   which I think is terribly important.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.220]   Words matter, the playbook matters,
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:38.300]   and the negligence or ignorance of another culture
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   as it digests our words, our actions,
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.620]   our intentions is very consequential,
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.380]   and unfortunately, we see this pattern with the president
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.780]   of doing what he did today in using that term.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.400]   Whether or not it's really true or not,
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.620]   there are ways, as we all know, to simply not comment
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.580]   because that is going to undermine, I think,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.860]   a very important, otherwise very promising outcome.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.860]   And to your question, I'm concerned
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.700]   that we have made China perhaps into the very enemy
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.540]   that ostensibly now our military-industrial complex
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.740]   wants to defend us from, which happens time and time
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.100]   and time again through our history,
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.340]   and it concerns me deeply.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.720]   We should be partnering with China.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.520]   Our disagreements are real.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.880]   I think they should be litigated
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.520]   and bridged with diplomacy, not destruction.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.200]   And imagine what can be accomplished
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.180]   in this 21st century world if two nations like ours
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.360]   recognize the potential of spending less on destruction
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.560]   and more on human beings.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.280]   It astounds me.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.040]   - Do you think TikTok itself is a threat
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.880]   to the United States? - TikTok.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.840]   - And would you, if you were president, ban it
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   or force them to divest and remove the servers in China
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.560]   and the algorithm from China, et cetera?
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.400]   - I'll make this really simple.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.280]   - Do you think it's actually being used for PSYOPs?
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.160]   - I'll make this really simple.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.040]   If we want to change our constitution
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.840]   and change what we consider speech,
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.800]   change how the federal government
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.620]   or any domestic government affects people's rights
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.660]   to what they watch, what they read, what they eat,
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.120]   how they pray, how they think, where they go,
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.960]   with whom they congregate, you know what?
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.440]   That's up to Americans.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.280]   But I think to target one app is a huge mistake.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.720]   And I have a very simple solution.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.880]   Hold every single platform to the same standard,
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.960]   transparency via their algorithm,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.620]   have an independent commission perhaps
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.400]   that is charged and responsible with assessing
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.080]   and holding those platforms to account.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.600]   And if any of them violate the terms
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.400]   that we pass into law, then they should be banned.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.440]   But to target one, I think it's not sensible.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.800]   - You have foreign ownership rules for media outlets, yeah?
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.720]   So this has many more users
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.880]   and is much more powerful with the algorithm.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.760]   So then how would you respond to that sort of counterargument?
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.240]   - I'm just gonna say this.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.640]   If we want to change our constitution,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.080]   this is what the Supreme Court, I'm afraid,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.100]   is gonna say if we start doing this,
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.080]   then change the constitution.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.040]   That's what they said, by the way,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.760]   about women's reproductive rights.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.200]   In the absence of Congress doing anything,
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.400]   in the absence of that,
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.560]   we're gonna assess it the way it reads.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.040]   Right now, I don't think that's necessarily really possible
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.320]   without a significant Supreme Court challenge.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.200]   My belief is yes.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.040]   Is it a threat?
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.880]   Yes, it's a threat.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.380]   By the way, every social media platform is a threat
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.260]   when used by malign actors.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.100]   You know, Nikki Haley--
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.800]   - Do you think we should force reciprocity?
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.560]   If we allow TikTok, they allow Twitter,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.400]   Facebook, Instagram, and China, or--
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.920]   - I think that's the kind of thinking, Jason, I like.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.520]   In fact, reciprocity as it relates to IP,
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.520]   enforcement of IP, of theft, of trade,
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.800]   you just hit the nail on the head, reciprocity.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.240]   You know, let's be reciprocal
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.760]   in the nature of a relationship.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.520]   If you're gonna ban our apps and our platforms,
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.500]   our products, or our brands,
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.360]   well, why, this is to me an opportunity
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.240]   for the next generation to say this is nonsensical.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.760]   You know, if you're gonna, by the way,
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.000]   China, you all know, has,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.680]   they have a bubble they're facing
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.000]   that will make ours in 2008
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.640]   look like a gumball by comparison.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.760]   And that is coming down the pipe.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.680]   I think that has a lot to do with this
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.080]   kind of step towards rapprochement.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.320]   But yes, reciprocity,
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.040]   and to know that Facebook is not allowed.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.000]   Yeah, perfect example.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.280]   But in the United States,
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.560]   that doesn't change my contention
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.520]   that we should set the same standard
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.320]   for every platform, every media entity,
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.800]   whatever it might be, hold them accountable,
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.360]   and if they don't qualify or perform, then they're banned.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.120]   - Give us your just maybe societal then commentary
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.800]   on the number of people on TikTok right now.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.640]   - Oh, it's sickening.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.160]   - Advocating for,
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.480]   I don't even know what you wanna call it.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.040]   I guess reading and sympathizing
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.400]   with Osama bin Laden's justification.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.240]   - Yeah, with Osama bin Laden's.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.720]   Well, first of all, I'm sure you guys do too.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.560]   I look at TikTok.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.200]   I consume as much media, as many platforms as possible,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.960]   so I understand why some of the nonsensical perspectives
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.400]   are being shared with me by so many people right now.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.240]   So I get it.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.520]   But back to the fundamental question,
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.600]   what do we do?
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.200]   This has been, by the way, an age-old issue
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.240]   since our very founding.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.960]   It used to be anonymous pamphlets
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.200]   that would spread misinformation or condemnation
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.240]   and fire people up.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.800]   Now it's just instantly available.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.600]   It doesn't matter if you have a printer,
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.640]   you can push a button.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.080]   And yes, am I concerned?
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.280]   Of course I am.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.600]   The fact that when I'm spending time
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   on college campuses right now
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.360]   and listening to otherwise really well-educated,
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.560]   privileged kids saying things that are so nonsensical,
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.480]   so ignorant, and so shocking,
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.120]   I know where it's coming from.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.960]   So I understand the problem just like all of you.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.240]   I think this question is, what do you do about it?
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   And all I'm saying is we should have the same standard
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.480]   for every platform because the same issue
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.640]   is on every platform.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.800]   That is my only contention.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.000]   - You're about to say this,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.280]   but what do you think about what Nikki Haley suggested?
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.160]   - I was shocked that people-
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.720]   - Maybe just frame for the listeners
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   who don't know what she said.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.200]   - So Nikki Haley, and I asked Mark Zuckerberg this one,
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.040]   so too I'll tell you.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.480]   Nikki Haley proposed that every platform,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.200]   every social media platform, have verified accounts,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.160]   no more anonymous accounts.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.360]   And she got ripped, got ripped.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.680]   You know, I understand.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.320]   This is, it's a reasonable argument to have,
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.600]   but I gotta tell you, I'm surprised that that's something
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.440]   that seems somewhat reasonable to people
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.320]   who are paying attention would have such a response
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.840]   that she actually retracted it.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.120]   I'm not proposing it.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.080]   I'm just saying that I think we should be throwing ideas
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.640]   on the table, and I know from experience,
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.960]   just like you guys, when you hide behind a fake name,
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.040]   you can be not just a jerk to someone,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.720]   you can be downright dangerous.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.800]   When your name's attached to it,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.440]   you behave in a very different manner,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.520]   not to mention when you're face to face.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.640]   So I don't think that was as absurd
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.480]   as people considered it.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.880]   I asked Mark Zuckerberg after a financial services hearing
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.280]   a couple of years ago, you know,
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.720]   why doesn't Facebook just verify accounts,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.840]   make this so much easier to hold people accountable
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.560]   and have higher standards of accountability?
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.920]   And he said it would be a competitive disadvantage.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.280]   And of course it is, if he only had to do it.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.520]   - Yeah, and this has been tested.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.200]   Korea had their version of this.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.960]   In order to sign up in Korea for their social networks
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.680]   or ISPs, you had to use your social security number.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.520]   - Sure, and that makes sense.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.840]   And the other thing, guys, is you know that, you know,
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.600]   if you write a letter to the editor
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.120]   of most major newspapers,
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.480]   you have to attach your name to it.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.600]   It has to be verified.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.040]   I just think it's a conversation that we should be having.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.720]   And by the way, you know, it might be time
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.680]   to read "Future Shock" again by Alvin Toffler,
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.080]   who predicted so much of this mess
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.200]   in which we find ourselves,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.520]   the incapacity of human beings to adapt
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.880]   to such rapid technological change,
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.920]   which by the way, you know, you on this,
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.480]   you, just the handful of you on this podcast
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.200]   have more expertise than the entire United States Senate
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.320]   and Congress combined as it relates
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.160]   to the issues we're talking about.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.000]   On tech, there is no capacity, no competency.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.080]   So on whom do we rely?
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.400]   The very lobbyists being paid by the very enterprises
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.280]   that so easily can set the standards.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.120]   - Right.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.400]   - But there aren't people of better capacity.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.920]   - And only 11 members of Congress
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.640]   have an engineering degree.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.480]   - Only 11.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.160]   And by the way, I was on,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.880]   Kevin McCarthy invited me to join his AI cabinet,
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.040]   which just, it was a few, four Democrats,
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.100]   about four Republicans.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.280]   We had our first meeting and started making plans
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.200]   right before he was deposed.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.480]   And now I don't know anything,
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.280]   if anything's going on in that respect.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.320]   - Where do you stand on the spectrum of decorum online
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.720]   on one end and free speech on the other?
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.880]   Where the absolutists would say,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.240]   absolutely not verified accounts as a non-starter
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.520]   because it just fundamentally undermines
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.860]   the first amendment and this other thing,
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.480]   which is more organized decorum.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.040]   - Chamath, I think that's the issue of our day.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.120]   Maybe the most important when it's true, both online,
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.640]   it's also true in our Congress right now.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   Where's that intersection between debate,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.060]   discord and comprehensive division.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.360]   I don't have the good answer for it right now,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   is the truth.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.840]   And I'm afraid that if you interpret our constitution,
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.720]   free speech has to be met with more free speech.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.840]   But I'll tell you,
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.480]   but that also will conflict and increasingly is
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.300]   with the right to pursue happiness.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.320]   I mean, that's just true.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:30.320]   I mean, it's the most complicated issue in our era.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.240]   Would I like to see our kids safer,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.280]   our mental health and emotional health improve
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.800]   and the division reduced
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.680]   and misinformation and disinformation rectified?
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.120]   Of course, because I do think--
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.680]   - Would you put a minimum age on use of social networks
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.520]   when you have kids?
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.200]   Would you make it 15, 16 years old?
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   - I think it would be healthier.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.640]   Look, we have minimum age for alcohol.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.600]   That's older than you have to be to fight in a war
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.440]   for God's sakes.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.840]   That's ridiculous.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.720]   You know, we have cannabis is still banned at the federal,
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.080]   the hypocrisy of the federal government
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.600]   is also what I'm running against right now.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.580]   So Jason, I think that is a good idea.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.760]   You know this, and I've had daughters
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.880]   that grew up in the social media era.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.360]   It is one of the most destructive,
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.580]   it is as destructive as I think drug consumption
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.120]   to adolescent health as anything else.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.060]   So to answer your question,
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.940]   I think that's A, perfectly legal,
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.440]   B, perfectly reasonable.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.240]   And you can't just entrust parents to do it
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.400]   because Johnny's parents will allow them
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   to have the phone and the apps, you know,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.880]   and Jill's won't.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.800]   And they can't, there has to be,
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.640]   I think there has to be,
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.880]   we do that for a lot of other things.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.640]   And I think we should talk about at what age
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.100]   any of this is reasonable,
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.880]   but absolutely I think that's not unreasonable.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.800]   I want kids to be safe just like you guys.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.640]   And so does everybody.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.040]   - That sounds like driving a car is a good bet
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.680]   for 15, 16, 17 years old.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.280]   - We should also allow kids to learn how to drink
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.520]   before they learn how to drive.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.300]   We're the only country that does it like this.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.160]   You know, drive for five years
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.360]   until you legally can drink.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.280]   So when you have your first drink,
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.760]   you don't even know what it's going to do to you.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.200]   You know, it's absurd.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   - Freeberg.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.280]   - I know we're going to talk about spending in a second,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.800]   but just before we get away from foreign policy,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.440]   I think it's important that we ask
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.040]   what would be your goals
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.840]   with respect to conflict in the Middle East?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.120]   What's the strategy you'd enjoy to achieve those goals
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.400]   and who are the people that you'd surround yourself with?
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.240]   - Well, I'll tell you,
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.880]   my strategy is quite simple.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.900]   It's peace around the world and it's prosperity at home,
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.740]   plain and simple.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.720]   And I can build,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.000]   I can put the legs of that stool together for you
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.840]   as quickly as I possibly can,
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.640]   but let's talk about the Middle East.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.440]   You know, I'm 54 years old.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.280]   President Biden has been in the US Senate
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.640]   or in the White House for 50 years.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.680]   None of us on this podcast have lived through anything
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.920]   but bloodshed, reciprocal misery
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.680]   between Palestinians and Israelis.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.520]   This cycle has continued for decades.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.360]   I've had enough.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.320]   I cannot stand the sight of babies being pulled
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.520]   from the wombs of mothers by Hamas in Israel
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.400]   any more than I can watch babies being destroyed
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.440]   by bombs and missiles in Gaza.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.540]   And it's gotta stop.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.000]   I am about to issue a statement to that end
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.880]   that says essentially,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.800]   Hamas must release all of its hostages, period,
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.560]   of which there are nine Americans, guys.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.480]   Nine Americans are being held in Gaza
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.400]   by a terrorist organization.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.080]   And as president, I would be making that my,
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.320]   not my daily desire or request,
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.560]   my daily demand, all hands on deck,
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.840]   these hostages must be released immediately.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.760]   - Would you send in special forces to collect them?
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.920]   - I would, absolutely.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.480]   It is incumbent on the president of the United States
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.680]   to extract Americans being held against their will
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.640]   by any foreign entity. - Why isn't Biden doing that?
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.780]   - I don't know, gotta ask him.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.840]   But good luck asking him
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.400]   'cause he doesn't do any press conferences.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.200]   - The goal for peace is reasonable,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.520]   but these, like maybe some specifics around your strategy.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.760]   - So let me, yeah, let me, so, okay, so first,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.680]   at the moment the hostages are safely released,
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.520]   there should be a ceasefire, period.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.480]   And at that very moment,
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.840]   there should be a multinational peacekeeping force
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.520]   sent into Gaza to maintain security immediately.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.000]   When I say multinational,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.400]   the very nations that are connected to Gaza,
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.840]   Arab nations have to be part of it,
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.000]   not the United States, not Israel, of course,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.400]   but a significant force there to keep the peace immediately.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.080]   Concurrently, a multinational coalition
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.280]   designed to eliminate Hamas by every nation in the world
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.340]   that wants them eliminated, which frankly is most.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.320]   And then we have got to invest, again,
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.280]   nations of the world investing
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.760]   in a democratic civil society, infrastructure,
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.880]   education, facilities, and security
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.040]   so that a new generation of Palestinian leaders
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.600]   can create a circumstance
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.700]   whereby another nation can be created, period.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.200]   And it's not gonna happen with Israel
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.280]   and Palestinians trying to do this.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.060]   It has got to be imposed.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.560]   It has gotta be a coalition of the willing.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.460]   And then only, then and only then
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.400]   will we see the conditions for, hopefully,
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.480]   elections for Palestinians for the first time
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.960]   since 2006, 17 years.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   And concurrently, it is time for Israelis
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.760]   to call an election to replace Benjamin Netanyahu
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.020]   because he is absolutely part of Israel's security problem.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.360]   I've looked him in the eye.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.440]   I told him before this happened earlier this year,
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.720]   I've been with him twice, looked him in the eye.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.440]   I said, "What you are doing is affecting the relationship
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.020]   "with the United States and Israel
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.880]   "and will absolutely affect security moving forward."
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.520]   I had no idea what would be coming on October 7th.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.400]   But the settlement policy, the right-wing government,
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.840]   the distraction that the judicial reform initiative
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.200]   has created in that country made the conditions ripe.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.720]   And by the way, having been in Riyadh recently, too,
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.240]   it was really getting close,
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.000]   the Saudis and Israelis normalizing.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.600]   And that was exactly why I believe,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.840]   whether it's implicit or explicit,
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.720]   Iran inspired Hamas to do this then.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.640]   And by the way, in the United States, mark my words,
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.680]   there are, our adversaries are watching the dysfunction
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.840]   and distraction right now with the same open eyes.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.160]   And we have borders that are awfully easily to get in.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.180]   And that's the truth.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.680]   And I'm a Democrat saying that.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.320]   I would do this entirely differently.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.000]   - Can you actually talk about the border?
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.160]   Tell us what would you do there?
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.520]   - Once again, I've got a lot of colleagues
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.760]   who make their decisions by reading an article,
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.400]   seeing a tweet or seeing a TikTok.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.120]   I go, I've been to Israel and the Middle East twice
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   just in the last number of months.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.360]   I've been to the Southern border twice.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.280]   I've seen with my own eyes.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.840]   It is the most despicable, embarrassing failure
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.000]   of American policy I have ever seen.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.400]   I have seen women walking across the Rio Grande
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.220]   with babies in their arms who have spent six or $7,000,
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:36.560]   their whole life savings, paid to gangs and coyotes
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.340]   to bring them across the border.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.120]   I've seen the extraordinary beauty and grace
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.560]   with which border patrol agents
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.780]   have looked after these people.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.040]   I've seen babies who were abandoned
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.520]   that were on 24-hour care of border patrol agents
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.080]   who took as good a care of these little kids
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.700]   as they would their own.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.080]   I saw people in cages.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.140]   I saw the most archaic, out-of-date, inefficient,
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.380]   ineffective ports of entry.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.760]   I saw lines of trailer trucks,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.360]   probably two, three miles long,
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.920]   idling in the hot, hot weather, waiting to get across.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.760]   I saw a mile long of human beings
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.860]   waiting to come into the country to do their shopping
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.220]   or their job or their education.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.520]   And it was horrifying.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.180]   And if we think, by the way,
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.140]   we need much better border security,
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.460]   barriers, technologies, and facilities.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.400]   And by the way, we also need it at the northern border.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.920]   I'm a border state in Minnesota.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.640]   People walk across farm fields in Manitoba into Minnesota.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.780]   We don't know who they are.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.620]   Some of them get caught.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.460]   That's true.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.900]   But I'll tell you guys, if we think
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.260]   that we can solve the problem at the border,
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.500]   that's the issue right there.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.200]   This administration and past ones just don't get it.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.160]   We should be adjudicating asylum cases
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.600]   in countries of origin.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.240]   Why make these poor people take their life savings
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.740]   that they have no, then they have no money.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.680]   They're set off in the streets here.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.520]   They're supposed to come back to a court two years from now.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.960]   Let them keep their money.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.200]   Let's build dormitories next to our consulates
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.220]   or our embassies in the Northern Triangle countries,
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.720]   wherever migrants are coming.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.120]   Create some safety security there.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.420]   Invest in local economies
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.280]   so that there can be some opportunity.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.020]   And adjudicate their cases there.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:13.060]   If they qualify, let's bring them to America
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.280]   with six or $7,000 in their pocket
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.780]   so they can start a nice new life
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.960]   and pursue the American dream.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.300]   And if they don't,
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.000]   they will be kept in their countries of origin.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.780]   And of course, we have to work with Mexico as well.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.420]   But this is not rocket science.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.880]   It's simple problem solving.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.940]   And the fact that we continue to do this stupid policy
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.420]   to this day, you guys, is embarrassing.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.780]   - On the other side of this,
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.060]   talk about recruiting.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.220]   Many countries, Canada, New Zealand,
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.980]   a lot of the Nordics have a point-based system
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.360]   and they actively recruit talent.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.460]   You're an entrepreneur.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.260]   You've been CEO of multiple companies.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.740]   It is an absolute arduous pain
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.780]   to get talented people here right now.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.980]   Recruitment of talent in the United States
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.700]   is bundled with the Southern border.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.740]   How would you decouple that?
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.380]   Would you be in favor of a point-based system
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.400]   and recruitment of talent
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.800]   to get more talented immigrants in our country?
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.180]   Which by the way, three of the four besties here
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.180]   were not born in the United States.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.280]   - And by the way, my foremothers and forefathers
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.780]   came here for the same reasons.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.780]   Same reasons that every one of those moms and dads
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.100]   is coming across the Rio Grande.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.940]   So to answer your question directly, Jason,
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.700]   I think we can do both.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.220]   I think we should have a merit-based system
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.600]   to attract the best and brightest and most talented.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.620]   I'm sure all of you came from enterprises
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.220]   that would afford benefits, perhaps education to people.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.260]   You would expect them to actually stay at your enterprise
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.460]   for a number of years as a payback.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.840]   We are right now, the United States is training
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.800]   some of the best and brightest in the world,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.380]   not creating opportunities to stay.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.100]   And of course, Canada is the beneficiary,
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.620]   the Nordic countries, European countries.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.020]   You guys know this.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.660]   This notion that we can't do two things at once,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.460]   that we can't welcome the most disadvantaged
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.380]   who simply want to pursue an American dream
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.940]   and start at the very bottom
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.660]   and match that with some of the best and brightest
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.380]   who can actually start at the very top.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.180]   My goodness, why does everything have to be binary,
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.420]   you guys, black and white, good or bad, yes or no?
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.260]   It's nonsense.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.260]   - Before we run out of time.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.020]   - Oh darn, that's way too short.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.180]   - No, no, no, for you.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.020]   I think we got a little over time.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.900]   - I got more, hey, I got time, guys.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.940]   - Oh, okay, great.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.100]   We really want to talk. - I got time, yeah.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.460]   - Freeberg and I are, I think Freeberg,
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.540]   you know, moved me to his position on this.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.100]   Number one issue for this election, Freeberg,
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.460]   correct me if I'm wrong for you,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.740]   is still our out of control spending.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.700]   Maybe you could tee this up.
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I've said this in the past.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.620]   I think the US is facing a fiscal emergency
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.020]   in the sense that arithmetic starts to play out,
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.140]   that the cost of debt spirals.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.540]   We can't accomplish any of the other stuff
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.180]   we're talking about unless we can figure this out.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.260]   We have $33 trillion of debt today.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.580]   The treasury estimates it's going to grow
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.980]   to 47 trillion by 2033, just 10 years away.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.820]   One and a half trillion in deficit this year,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.380]   trillion in debt interest expense alone this year,
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.740]   and a third of our debt is coming up to be refinanced soon.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.940]   It's going to get refinanced at 4.5% interest rate
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.220]   instead of the 2, 2.5% it's sitting at today.
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.940]   So the interest will swell, the deficit will swell,
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:03.060]   the debt will swell, and we're already taxing 18% of GDP
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.860]   as federal revenue, which a lot of economists have shown
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.020]   you can only get to 20%, at which point,
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.340]   economy starts to shrink.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.900]   I think pretty good research on this.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:12.780]   Some would argue differently,
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.580]   but I think that's kind of a natural limit.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:19.580]   So the only kind of response is what's wrong with spending?
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.740]   Like, why do we have the spending problem?
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.260]   I guess the question for you is what is causing,
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.900]   structurally, the spending problem?
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.460]   A lot of people have said that this is late stage empire,
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.940]   the failure of democracy, 'cause everyone votes themselves
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.500]   all the money eventually,
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.580]   or is it a politically oriented problem
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.220]   where folks don't want to address the biggest line items?
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.980]   They don't want to hold programs to account?
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.940]   And what is the answer here?
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.580]   - So to answer your question directly,
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.660]   you asked what the cause is,
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.860]   it's incompetency and perverse incentives, period.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.140]   There is no political,
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.460]   there used to be a political reward for conservatives
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.540]   who were focused on fiscal responsibility,
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:03.180]   'cause they would win elections over tax and spenders.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.140]   But that party is long gone, long gone.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:06.980]   There's no reward,
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.540]   that's why Trump added $7 trillion to the deficit,
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.460]   and that's why Biden will probably add
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.060]   about that much as well.
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.040]   So, by the way, I think I'm one of the only Democrats
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.220]   who has been named by the Committee
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.980]   for a Responsible Federal Budget
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.700]   one of their fiscal heroes as a Democrat.
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:27.080]   And also, I'm a Hamilton Jefferson Award winner
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.900]   by the US Chamber of Commerce.
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.220]   And I'm also pro-worker.
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:32.140]   This notion that you can't be, by the way,
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.780]   pro-business and pro-worker,
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.780]   that they're somehow mutually exclusive, that's BS.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:37.900]   They're mutually mandatory.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.420]   But back to your question,
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.960]   33 trillion in debt, by the way,
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.700]   our economy can accommodate more, that's the sad truth.
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.260]   The issue is our debt service,
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.780]   and nobody's talking about the fact
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.900]   that it is going to go from the mid 400 billion a year
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.160]   to your point, Dave, with the higher interest rates,
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.540]   probably approaching a trillion, maybe 840.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.380]   - No, it's already over a trillion,
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.340]   it's a trillion one today,
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.180]   it's gonna be a trillion five.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:01.580]   - Well, let's see, I don't, I would argue that maybe,
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.700]   we could have a little argument about
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.780]   if it's there quite yet, but either way,
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.580]   let's call it a trillion.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.700]   That means literally, that means literally
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.420]   we are spending way more for the past
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.400]   than we are investing in the future.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.740]   That means we have literally no dollars left
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.060]   for any discretionary spending.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.580]   Every bit of it is now consumed by Social Security,
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.420]   Medicare, and our military.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:28.340]   And on top of that, we've got people sleeping
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.420]   on the streets in every single town and city in America,
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.460]   we have kids going to school hungry,
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.380]   we have one of the most, to me,
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:38.980]   failing public school systems in the entire developed world,
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.900]   we have a healthcare system that is not healthcare,
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:43.300]   it's sick care, a fee for service model
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:47.460]   that should be capitated, and our outcomes are mid-pack,
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.820]   and we have a $2 trillion deficit,
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.700]   and by the way, no childcare, no pre-K education,
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.980]   I can go on down the list, it's nonsensical,
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.340]   and we're spending $2 trillion more.
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.860]   So to answer your question,
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.980]   you guys know the answer here,
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.100]   we're a country with, I think, $150-some-trillion,
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.100]   $150-some-trillion in total United States household wealth.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.860]   - Where do you cut?
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.980]   Let's start by getting into those specifics.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.420]   Do you cut entitlements?
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.600]   Do you cut military?
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.460]   Where do you cut, and how do you cut?
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.780]   - So here's what I would do.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.300]   Starting with Social Security.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.980]   Social Security, you guys, is the most successful
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.200]   anti-poverty program in world history,
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.020]   and I believe it would be not just a dereliction of duty,
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.020]   it would be counter to every American principle
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.220]   if senior citizens struggled.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.840]   By the way, we don't have a culture in America
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.700]   that takes care of the elders, like in most Asian cultures
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.940]   and other wonderful cultures in the world.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.100]   So absent that, we have to afford resources.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.480]   So two things, as you all know, Social Security,
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.540]   the trust fund, will face probably reductions
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:57.100]   at about 25% cut levels by 2033,
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.140]   based on the current path.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.180]   Two easy things we can do.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.380]   $160,000 a year is the cap right now, I think, roughly.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.780]   We should make that 250.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.600]   That means it's a very regressive tax.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.220]   If you're making 160, you're paying a whole lot more
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.580]   of your income than someone making 250, $300,000 a year,
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.500]   not to mention 3 million or 30 million.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.100]   So we should raise the cap to 250,
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.700]   make sure that fund at least is solvent
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   through probably 2046, 2047.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.860]   And then I would do something different
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.120]   for the first time in American history.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.060]   For all the millions of Americans who've done well,
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.940]   don't need their Social Security,
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.980]   that wish to become philanthropists,
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.820]   I would create a pool, not that goes back to the Treasury,
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.980]   a pool that would be automatically redistributed
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.260]   to the lowest five or 10% of all Social Security recipients
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.740]   in the entire country.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740]   And let's say it might be a $500 boost,
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.660]   it might be a $1,000 boost a year
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.480]   for the most challenged elderly Americans.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.700]   But when 40% of Americans can't afford
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.460]   a $400 car repair or emergency expense,
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.500]   not for this group, but--
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.060]   - No, to your point, I think it was the Fed
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.660]   or it was Treasury that published a study.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.620]   I was shocked by the actual number
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.580]   of American millionaires that exist.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.900]   And it's counter to the narrative,
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.380]   'cause if you just read the headlines,
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.860]   you think America's an economic despair, and it's not true.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:24.420]   And the wealth creation is actually quite pervasive,
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.780]   which is a great feature of American capitalism.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:30.260]   So to your point, there probably are a lot of people
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.780]   who would be willing to pay it forward
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.940]   to folks that didn't have it if you gave them the choice.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.220]   It's just not possible today.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.680]   - So why shouldn't we be a government that creates,
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.620]   so just, Sharmath, if I could just say,
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:43.620]   one of my perspectives and intentions is to not,
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.940]   by the way, we don't have to spend money
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.300]   to expose young people who never get out
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.580]   of their neighborhoods in many cities in this country,
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.940]   expose them to possibility, get them into factories,
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.780]   into ad agencies, into high-tech centers,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.460]   show them rockets and music makers and artists.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.700]   We don't need to spend a whole lot more money
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.420]   to simply completely change the path
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.660]   of young Americans' lives,
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.780]   not to mention old Americans' lives.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.700]   And that's just a perfect example of a simple solution
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:18.300]   that costs zero and lets Americans actually be Americans.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.740]   - Okay, so now go to Medicare,
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.020]   but I think I know what you're gonna say
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.380]   'cause you mentioned it, capitation,
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.340]   but maybe talk very quickly on that,
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.260]   and then military, what do you cut there?
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.300]   - So quickly on healthcare, look, guys,
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.140]   I represent United Health Group in my district.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.820]   Tens of thousands of Minnesotans,
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.820]   many of them who live in my district,
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.820]   earn very handsome salaries from United.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.820]   They've done some great work in many ways,
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.140]   but I have to tell you, since I've joined Congress
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:48.380]   in my third term now, you would be in tears
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.660]   if you had to sit with the people that I've sat with
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.540]   over so many occasions who thought they had coverage,
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.540]   whose son got sick or whose mother broke a leg or something,
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.860]   and they literally have gone bankrupt
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.620]   or take on tens of thousands of dollars in medical debt
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.540]   and they get surprise bills,
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.820]   and then they read in the paper
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.380]   that their health insurer reported annual net income
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.780]   of over $20 billion.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.220]   And I don't know how you guys feel,
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.820]   but I gotta tell you, I'm a capitalist.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.620]   I'm also compassionate,
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.260]   and I can no longer reconcile that.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:22.340]   I really can't.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.340]   There's a reason we're the only nation in the world
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.820]   that does it this way.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.260]   I think it's time, by the way,
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.620]   from Roosevelt to Truman to Richard Nixon,
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.660]   Richard Nixon proposed universal health coverage,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.260]   and it was Ted Kennedy that undermined it,
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.460]   if you can imagine that.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.340]   If we don't, if conservatives and progressives
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.420]   don't come to the table and talk about
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.340]   how we can deliver a national health insurance program
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.820]   that is portable,
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.580]   lets gig economy participants do their thing,
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.860]   that people don't have to make choices
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.380]   about where to work just because of the healthcare,
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.060]   I don't know why we wouldn't talk about that.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.900]   And by the way,
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.180]   I'm not talking about the provision of care.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.820]   It's really important 'cause Fox News
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.460]   and some Republicans have tried to say
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.860]   this is a socialized solution.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.860]   Uh-uh, just the coverage,
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.420]   because the money is in the system already
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.820]   between three, four, five, six X pharma costs,
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.020]   between two X health per capita health costs,
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.260]   10,000 per person compared to any country in the world
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.140]   at five.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.420]   The answer is, I think, right there in front of us.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.700]   The money's in the system,
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.160]   would not require a tax increase.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.220]   I think we could actually save substantial money.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.380]   I'm working on a proposition right now.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.100]   I would argue that the model is part of the problem.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.980]   Fee for service is antithetical to what we need.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.380]   We need a capitated model that gives an incentive
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:36.380]   to the providers to keep people out of the hospital.
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:37.380]   - Totally agree. - At least try.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.820]   So that's the answer on that.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:42.660]   And by the way, right now, Medicare, as you probably know,
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.660]   I think 23% of the country,
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.140]   or no, between Medicare and the VA,
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.300]   which are single-payer systems,
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.220]   25% of Americans right now
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.900]   are covered by a single-payer system.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.540]   And by the way, it works better than the other system.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.820]   Medicare recipients are pretty pleased.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.340]   - This would also be a huge benefit
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.220]   as a capitalist running companies.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.620]   I mean, how much of your time
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.300]   was spent running your companies
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.020]   dealing with healthcare and the dysfunction
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.060]   of employees staying at companies
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.460]   because they couldn't get healthcare in another company?
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.620]   - What about military, Dean?
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.460]   What would you do there?
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.860]   - Okay, now military, and this is where,
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.420]   to answer your question very directly once again,
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.580]   nobody can tell you that they can even begin
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.900]   to address our fiscal challenges
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.380]   without looking at that ridiculous number,
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:30.540]   approaching a trillion dollars a year.
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.820]   And by the way, the Pentagon has not passed an audit.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.900]   They would, in my administration,
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.500]   there would be a top-down assessment
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.100]   of every single program, every single base and facility,
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.180]   every explanation of why we are in those 80 nations
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.260]   and whether or not we should be employing
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.380]   21st century strategies to keep our country safe.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.460]   And I think one of the simplest solutions, you guys,
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.700]   is we should be entrusting countries
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.980]   more proximate to the problems to manage them.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.260]   It doesn't mean we're not a good ally anymore.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.860]   It just doesn't mean that we are in a position any longer
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.780]   to be the policemen for the entire world
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.620]   when we can barely take damn care of our country itself.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.820]   It's just so damn simple, and I'm frustrated by it
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.140]   because as someone who lost his father
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.300]   in a completely obnoxious and unnecessary war,
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.620]   a guy that I have on my phone right now,
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.300]   digital audio tapes that he used to send back tapes
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.660]   to my mom, where he says, "I've come to the conclusion,"
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.220]   and he loved America.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.500]   He did not like that war, but he loved America.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.060]   He said, "I believe the only reason we're still here
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.380]   "is because so many people are making so much money."
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.060]   He saw it, and the same thing is happening to this day.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.140]   You guys, that trillion dollars, that's going somewhere.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.420]   It's going in people's pockets,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.780]   and I believe we can cut that,
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.420]   and I'm not gonna make a proposition,
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.580]   but I believe after a comprehensive assessment
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.380]   that we can save hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.940]   that can either be saved on the bottom line or better yet,
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:59.380]   actually invested in human beings
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.700]   instead of the destruction of them, period.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.020]   - Would you zero-base budget the military?
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:03.860]   - Absolutely.
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.500]   Chamath, I've had to go back to Washington twice
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.940]   to vote on CRs, continuing resolutions.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.900]   The dysfunction is absurd.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.260]   There are maybe five people that can read a P&L
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.100]   or a balance sheet in the whole damn Congress.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.060]   Our budgeting system is completely broken,
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.260]   and yes, as president, I would demand
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.820]   a zero-base budgeting procedure,
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.300]   and like I said, a comprehensive,
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.780]   independent assessment of every program,
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:37.060]   and if it is not generating a return,
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.180]   or if it could be outsourced to the private sector
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.860]   that can deliver it for a better value,
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.100]   that's how we should proceed, and by the way,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.420]   it may not be easy, it may take time to get done,
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.260]   but why we don't try is absurd,
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.340]   and to answer your final question, if we don't,
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.500]   and once foreign investors no longer consider
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.940]   the United States of America
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.380]   the safest place to deploy capital, it's too late,
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.300]   and I will not, certainly under my watch,
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.660]   will not let us get there, but we've gotta recraft,
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.420]   and lastly, can I say one more thing quick on that, Chamath?
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.260]   - Please.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.180]   - If the only way that I think we can address
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.840]   the biggest issue in the country,
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.660]   which is the growing disparity between those who have wealth
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.580]   and income and those that do not,
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.220]   we're not a nation that will redistribute.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.100]   I think we've been not just unsuccessful,
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.540]   we've actually created some of the problems
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.260]   we now find ourselves in.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.700]   The way to do it is to raise the foundation,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.940]   the same way it was raised for me,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.740]   by a stroke of good luck.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.720]   I was adopted by a dad who gave me everything,
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.660]   and who knows where I would've been if that didn't happen.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.100]   I wanna do the same thing for everybody.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.020]   Have healthcare, have great education, have childcare,
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.500]   make sure you have a house, a place to live.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.700]   If we give everybody the same thing,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.380]   then we can be a country that believes in self-determination
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.620]   and-- - So let's talk about
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.820]   education then briefly.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.140]   So if the spectrum is the teachers union
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.060]   on one end of the spectrum,
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.300]   and Vivek Ramaswamy, who would dismantle
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.380]   the Department of Education at the federal level
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.700]   and just push all the responsibility to the states
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.580]   with the voucher program, he talked about it here once,
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.060]   where are you and what's your philosophy
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.060]   on the state of education?
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.780]   - I would say I'm in the middle,
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.980]   because I think there's some worthiness
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.300]   to both of those perspectives.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.660]   What would I do?
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.820]   I would fundamentally reinvent American public education
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.140]   with the best and the brightest,
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:29.060]   with students, with teachers, with families,
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.140]   with the nonprofit sector and the business sector,
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.420]   because right now business needs to participate
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.680]   in 21st century education to advise the teachers
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.660]   and the administrators and the curricula designers
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.480]   what skills they need.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.820]   They're not even part of the conversation, you guys.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.940]   I don't know about you all.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.340]   - Well, why do you think that there are certain places,
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.460]   progressive, liberal bastions, if you will,
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.320]   that have been the first to dismantle things
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.220]   like STEM and AP classes?
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.460]   Why is that happening?
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.580]   - I wish I had a good answer for that.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.260]   It's appalling, but I do have a good solution.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.500]   I'm sure like you guys, you all know this,
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.700]   the single most important determinant
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.540]   of a child's success educationally
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.380]   is the quality of their educator.
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.820]   Every single study says the same thing.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.420]   The United States of America right now,
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:20.060]   we pay about 81% of the per capita GDP
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.340]   to teachers for compensation.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.060]   The best performing systems in the world,
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.780]   and there is a correlation, pay 120, 130,
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:30.380]   sometimes 140, 140% of their per capita GDP.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.140]   They make teaching one of the most admired,
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.680]   elevated professions in their nation.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.620]   They identify great teachers when they're still young.
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.780]   And I think we should be a nation that does the same thing.
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:43.060]   We're not attracting the best and brightest any longer.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.300]   When Teach for America teachers
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.220]   outperform teachers who have tenure
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.220]   or been at it for 10, 20, 30 years,
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.380]   does that not say the quality matters?
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.100]   It's not the school, how it looks.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.180]   But anyway, I would reinvent.
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.340]   And the other thing is this,
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.180]   I'm sure like you guys,
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.740]   I remember a couple of teachers
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.340]   that made a huge difference in my life,
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.000]   and there are about 50, I could barely remember it all.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.620]   They should all be those two.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.880]   And then furthermore,
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.660]   if you think sitting in front of a blackboard
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.420]   is the way to teach kids in this day and age,
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:11.940]   no, you gotta get out of the school.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.540]   You gotta look at Scandinavian countries
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.780]   and Asian countries and how experiential learning,
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.620]   learning from the best,
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.500]   most extraordinary educators in the world
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:23.220]   through screens on occasion, but to experience.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:27.620]   AI is gonna fundamentally change employment as we know it.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.820]   We have nobody in Washington that gets it.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.740]   We need an administration in 2024 that does
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.380]   and begins to simply rectify all of these problems
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.980]   anticipating the change that's coming.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.820]   This administration is not gonna do it.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.180]   And education should be redesigned,
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:46.460]   based on the change we know is coming.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.980]   And I don't have all the answers,
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.780]   but I know a lot of people out in California
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.420]   and around the country and around the world
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.260]   who could help us-
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.460]   - Is it too early to regulate AI?
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.700]   Or is it- - No.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.220]   - No, you think we should regulate AI?
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.420]   - I think it should be very,
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.340]   Jason, I would say right now it should be very limited.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.420]   And this is where back to the conversation
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.400]   about anonymous accounts.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.720]   We do have to set, I think, some standards
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.100]   and penalties for nefarious use of AI.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.020]   If we don't do that early and set the tone,
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.820]   I think it will get out of control.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.820]   So to me, that's all we should do right now.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.940]   And let it grow, let it expand,
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.460]   let large enterprises and small come up
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.860]   with extraordinary ways to save money, by the way.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.920]   AI is gonna save extraordinary sums of money
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.500]   for the federal government and healthcare, for businesses.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.980]   We can anticipate how employment will change
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:36.660]   and what jobs will be jobs of the future.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.260]   But if we don't think about that now,
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.160]   we're gonna do what Congress always does,
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.480]   get caught off guard, have to come in on a midnight,
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.360]   ill-prepared with a thousand page bill
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.020]   that nobody understands because it was written by a lobbyist
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.680]   that had skin in the game and does not serve America.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.360]   And that maybe wraps up this whole conversation.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.320]   - Yeah, I'm just not sure folks really understand
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.560]   in Congress what they're doing.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.960]   - No. - It's front.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.080]   Like the difference between foundational models
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.120]   and the utilization of those models in an endpoint
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.000]   are very different regimes to think about regulation.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.560]   And they're not even,
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.200]   that framework isn't even understood.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.480]   - Not at all.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.200]   - We're not even talking about regulating outcomes.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.040]   - No.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.760]   - Or actions, we're talking about regulating
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.960]   the infrastructure that could cause various outcomes.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.800]   - Regulate, regulate.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.160]   - I'm very much against where this is all evolved to.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.400]   - I agree. - And I think like some folks
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.360]   kind of wanna say, hey, this is a regulatory capture moment.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.720]   But I wanna see someone in Congress stand up
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.640]   and demonstrate an understanding first
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.520]   before they can even have the right to articulate
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.160]   a framework for regulation.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.400]   - Well, Dave, I can tell you, there's one man,
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.560]   I wanna shout out this guy,
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.640]   Don Beyer is a former US ambassador, Democrat from Virginia.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.000]   He must be 70.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.520]   He went back to college, I think Johns Hopkins,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.840]   and just received or is pursuing his degree
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.040]   in artificial intelligence.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.480]   That's the kind of representative.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.320]   Isn't that cool?
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.140]   You would never know his name
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:08.420]   if he's not on Fox or MSNBC screaming at night.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.540]   But those are the kinds of people that should be celebrated.
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.740]   A lot of my Republican colleagues
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.060]   that got thrown out of Congress
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:17.380]   because they had the audacity to support the Constitution
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:21.260]   when Trump was impeached the second time.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.620]   Those people I celebrate.
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.180]   I gotta run, but can I tell one quick story
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.620]   to wrap my whole story up
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.460]   and about what I wanna try to do?
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:31.180]   At the end of the day, none of this occurs,
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.180]   none of the successes, none of the policy ideas,
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.660]   none of the ideation occurs if we don't repair.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.620]   And that means restoring friendships,
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.960]   our families, our communities, and our country.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.540]   So I do a series back home in Minnesota
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.540]   called Common Ground.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.160]   I get six Democrats and six Republicans invited to a table.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   We break bread, we introduce ourselves,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.020]   tell a little bit of our life stories.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.620]   We talk about healthcare policy,
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.340]   and we talk about immigration policy,
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.900]   which is where everything I shared tonight
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.300]   comes from both Democrats and Republicans.
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.420]   And it's a two hour session
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.220]   facilitated by an extraordinary group called Braver Angels.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.740]   I encourage you to look them up.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:10.240]   They are remarkable doing this work all around the country.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.580]   And at the end of these sessions,
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.260]   we go around the table and each person at the table
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.380]   shares a little bit about
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.980]   what they got out of this experience.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.420]   And I had an episode not long ago
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.660]   that sums up my whole mission.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.380]   A young woman, Emily, looks across the table at Dave
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.180]   and says, "Dave, when you drove up in your F-150
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.860]   with the Trump sticker on it,
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.300]   I almost got back in my car,
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.060]   left the parking lot and drove away.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.720]   I could not bear to go in the building,
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.520]   let alone sit at a table with you."
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.540]   And she said, "But I gotta say, I so loved sitting here.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.940]   And you're a good guy and I learned something."
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:45.340]   Goes around the table, comes to Dave,
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.560]   and he looks at Emily and says,
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.220]   "Emily, when you drove up in your Prius,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.460]   I wanted to run it over."
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:55.180]   And he says, "But hey, I gotta tell you, Emily,
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.500]   I've never met a progressive as cool as you
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.780]   and I really am glad I came to this today."
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:02.460]   And at that moment, Emily and Dave
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.420]   stood up in front of our table and they embraced.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.380]   And to see a bleeding heart liberal
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.340]   and a dyed in the wool Trumper do that
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.660]   probably was the most important moment
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.140]   in my entire career in service.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.500]   If that is the only moment of its kind
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:22.060]   in my career in service, it would have made it worthwhile.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:25.020]   And that is exactly what I'm going to inspire
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.780]   as President of the United States.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:29.940]   Get Emily and Dave to hug it out.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.900]   All they have to do is be invited for a little dinner,
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.540]   given some space and place to recognize their common cause
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.940]   and their common ground.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.460]   And that's how we're gonna do this.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.620]   I don't see a candidate right now in the ballot
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.620]   that has that intention, has that capacity,
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.300]   or has that capability.
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.180]   So I just wanna thank you guys and yeah.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:48.940]   - Last thing and just yes or no.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.580]   Can everybody expect that you will be on the ballot
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.420]   in every state?
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.580]   - I can't say I'm gonna be in the ballot
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.400]   in every state, Shamaf,
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.940]   because I don't think it's possible.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.740]   Between time and money,
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.240]   I'm gonna have to make some choices.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.220]   And that's just the sickening truth.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.120]   I wanna salute Bernie Sanders.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.020]   He actually made it possible for a candidate like me
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.860]   and probably future candidates
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.420]   who are subject to this nauseating system
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.620]   to actually still compete and get to the convention
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:18.760]   and maybe win because he depowered people like me,
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.740]   members of Congress that used to have outsized votes,
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.680]   disproportionately so, versus voters.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.160]   And I celebrate him because he was right.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.440]   I used to think he was a sore loser.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.440]   Bernie Sanders was absolutely right about a rigged system
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.480]   that is keeping people out of the process,
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.140]   keeping candidates out of the process,
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:39.140]   and keeping debate out of the process.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.940]   So I'm gonna be on most ballots.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.400]   I've gotta raise money and frankly,
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.440]   I hate to be shameless, but the truth is,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.960]   if we want to get on ballots, I need support.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.400]   And it's easy, Dean24.com.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.460]   By the way, I'm at 15% in New Hampshire
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:55.380]   after just two weeks.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:57.340]   We thought it would take six if we were lucky.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.180]   - Wow.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.060]   - So people can throw 15 bucks our way
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.100]   to get on ballots at dean24.com.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.740]   And by the way, Joe Biden, 27%.
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:09.140]   73% of New Hampshire Democratic voters
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:13.300]   do not want the sitting president of the United States
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.780]   as their nominee.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.440]   And mark my words, we're gonna bring change.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.280]   Thank you guys.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.100]   - All right.
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:19.940]   - Thank you so much, Dean.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.100]   - Thanks for your time.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:21.940]   - Peace. - Thank you very much.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.760]   - It's the faith, guys.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.600]   I mean it. - Thank you.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.440]   - Love to see you again. - See you later.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.260]   - Yeah, great. - Thank you.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.540]   - A Great 90 Minutes with Dean Phillips.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:30.700]   Everybody go to dean24.com if you wanna learn more.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.640]   All right, besties.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.460]   I think that was another epic discussion
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.580]   with the presidential candidate.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.620]   What's your thoughts?
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.060]   Chamath, you set up this interview.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:44.100]   Where does he stand in your likely votes
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.460]   for president in 2024?
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.940]   Where would you rank him now?
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.460]   - Andrew Yang texted me like last week
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.900]   and said, "Would you guys do this?"
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.980]   And I was really interested because mostly
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.980]   I didn't know where he was coming from,
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.120]   to be totally honest.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.140]   But I think his national visibility
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.500]   is probably gonna increase a lot.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.820]   My reaction is that he is who he says he is,
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.140]   which is like kind of down the middle.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.580]   He doesn't take either extreme
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:14.580]   and he kind of takes a moderate point of view
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:18.120]   and says there's a balance of this and that that can work.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.860]   And that's actually good that he owns that
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.260]   as opposed to it being sort of a consequence
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.020]   or a byproduct of not getting what he wants.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.980]   He kind of like that is where he starts.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.300]   So I like that about him a lot.
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.840]   I thought he was really candid about what doesn't work.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.720]   I really appreciate that honesty.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.580]   He's saying some of the right things
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:41.580]   around capping Medicare, zero-based budgeting, the military.
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.340]   I think all of those things are right.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.940]   I didn't like, to be honest, the free speech part.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.260]   I thought that that was,
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.260]   I don't think you can have some kind of registry
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.980]   of verified accounts or something.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.740]   I just think that's a non-starter for America.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.100]   It's a super slippery slope.
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:02.340]   But in general, I was really impressed.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:07.260]   And his war stories as a businessman were pretty cool.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.100]   - Pretty awesome.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.500]   Sax, what's your candid thoughts?
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.180]   I mean, obviously he's not part of your political party,
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.420]   but where do you think his chances are versus Biden?
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.980]   And how would you assess his performance here today?
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.940]   - I was pleasantly surprised that he made the case
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:25.700]   for himself, not just based on Biden's age
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.140]   and the fact that he's 54,
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.220]   but he also, I think, took a number
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:31.860]   of interesting policy stances
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.340]   that were a little different than where Biden is.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:36.460]   He did it on foreign policy, he did it on domestic policy.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.300]   So I think he took a number of positions
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.020]   that were refreshing.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.780]   And a big one, I think, relates to his personal story,
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:48.500]   where he talks about how he lost his father in Vietnam
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.180]   and that that war was kept going much longer
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.540]   than it should have been because basically the greed
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.580]   of the military industrial complex.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.060]   And he didn't fully connect the dots all the way
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.500]   to our present situation in Ukraine,
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:03.620]   but at least I think he would be skeptical
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.700]   of the influence of the MIC in our politics.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.860]   What he said with respect to Ukraine is,
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.180]   well, he said that it would be shameful to abandon them now,
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.900]   but he also said that if it's true,
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.940]   he wasn't willing to concede it
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.500]   'cause he just didn't know factually,
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:19.460]   but if it's true that we could have avoided the war
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.340]   by taking NATO expansion off the table,
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:24.060]   then it would only be common sense to do that.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.140]   I think that when the histories of this are written,
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.300]   it's gonna be abundantly clear
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.500]   that we could have done precisely that.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:34.460]   So his difference of opinion with me isn't in the logic,
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:38.380]   it's just in what facts he knows to be true.
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:43.380]   So I actually thought that his position there was reasonable.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.540]   - You know, if it came down to a choice
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:50.700]   between Dean Phillips as the Democratic nominee
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.220]   and someone like Nikki Haley as a Republican nominee,
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.220]   I'd vote for Dean Phillips all day long.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.620]   You know, one other thing I like about him
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:00.180]   is he is a business owner
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.260]   and he presents as a Bill Clinton Democrat.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.500]   I mean, I think that it's not an accident
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.500]   he's got a picture of Bill Clinton on the wall behind him.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.940]   You know, he presents as a-
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.380]   - That was exactly my takeaway too.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.220]   I thought, wow, this is-
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:12.740]   - He presents as a moderate Democrat
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.060]   who's a little bit of a throwback
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.580]   to the Democratic Party of the 1990s.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:20.180]   If RFK Jr. is trying to bring back the Democratic Party
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.500]   of say the 1960s, the party of John F. Kennedy
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.580]   and Bobby Kennedy, his father,
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.500]   I think that Dean Phillips is more trying
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.060]   to bring back the Democratic Party of the 1990s.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.460]   Both of them, I think, are ultimately very out of step
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.140]   with where the Democratic Party is today,
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.260]   but they're out of step with it in ways that I like.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:40.560]   So he is a candidate who I could support
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.260]   against a Republican who,
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.020]   if we ended up getting a sort of stale
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.780]   neocon type Republican candidate,
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.740]   I would take a Dean Phillips all day long.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.220]   - Really? Wow, great.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.420]   Freeberg, your thoughts.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:55.980]   - I mean, I think if Joe Biden runs,
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.740]   he obviously doesn't stand a chance
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.020]   just based on the structural issues that he described.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:03.940]   If Joe Biden doesn't run and drops out,
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.340]   I think there are probably a lot of other
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.420]   Democratic candidates who are gonna have deeper pockets
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.440]   and more support from the party and more,
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:16.120]   celebrity or what have you to get themselves elected.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.520]   With respect to his candidacy
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.880]   and whether it's a realistic kind of campaign,
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.360]   I would probably argue no.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.800]   But what I really like is the fact that he is
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.560]   making the case, I think in a stronger way
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.200]   than even RFK Jr. was on how these incumbents
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.960]   and how the incumbency in the party system
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.920]   prevents new candidates from actually participating
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.960]   in a true democratic process.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.000]   And it feels to me a lot like what goes on in that sense
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.240]   is the equivalent of like regulatory capture,
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.960]   but in politics.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.560]   It allows these party leaders and influencers,
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.340]   which is a very small group of people
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:56.460]   to decide who gets to go on a ballot in the state,
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.000]   to decide who gets to be the nominee,
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.840]   who decides who gets to run for president.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.440]   The best thing that he's doing is exposing a system
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.440]   that Bernie Sanders calls rigged.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.760]   And that clearly I think is very inequitable
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.320]   and doesn't create a true kind of democratic process.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.080]   So it's really great to see him doing this work
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:13.960]   and telling the story.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.880]   And I'm glad we gave him the forum to do that
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.960]   for just that reason.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.120]   - And if you were to have a choice of him or Biden,
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.080]   you'd pick him?
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.040]   - Yeah.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   - If you had a choice of him or Vivek on the other side,
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:26.960]   who would you pick?
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.800]   - No comment.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.040]   - No comment, okay.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.800]   Taking off my moderator hat for a minute.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   Loved his business story, so I agree with you, Chamath.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.000]   Really excited to see somebody under the age of 80
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.160]   run for president.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.840]   And I thought there were really two powerful moments there
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.840]   when he said he would send special forces in
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.760]   and then he was pretty aggressive
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.200]   in his assessment of Netanyahu's leadership.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.160]   And overall, he did engage with every single issue
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.400]   and had interesting policy issues, no, Chamath?
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.160]   It seemed pretty engaging there.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.000]   So overall, great job, everybody.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.400]   I think four for four on the presidential candidates.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.880]   And just as a programming note,
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.560]   we have sent the first podcasting kits,
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.160]   first microphones to four presidential candidates,
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.120]   for those of you counting at home.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.000]   What do you think will happen post this, Chamath?
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.400]   Vivek got a big bump, RFK got a big bump.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.040]   What do you think is gonna happen post this?
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.440]   - I think that Dean Phillips is gonna pull really well.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.360]   The more that people get to see him,
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.280]   and I think New Hampshire is set up well
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.960]   for grassroots politics like this,
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.200]   it will go over very well.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.400]   The question I think Freeberg points is the key one,
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:35.400]   which is the party infrastructure has tremendous antibodies.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.920]   And if they decide to shut you out,
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.920]   which they did very strongly and vocally for RFK,
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.320]   you don't have much of a choice
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.520]   except to run as an independent.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.000]   So his candidacy is precarious,
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.240]   not because of the viability of him as a candidate, actually,
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.320]   'cause I think it's quite high,
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.000]   or his likability, which is quite high,
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.360]   or his electability, as Zach said,
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.160]   which against the right person is very high.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.880]   This has all to do with the antibodies
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.480]   of the infrastructure.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.760]   - And just a quick programming note,
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.480]   J. Cal, are you drinking a chocolate milk?
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.560]   - I am drinking a CorePower 26.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.040]   It's 26 grams of protein, I'm still on my,
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.080]   trying to eat more protein.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.680]   But I did have a Super Gut Bar earlier today for breakfast,
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.520]   which was quite nice.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.080]   - I thought that was a chocolate milk.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.440]   - This one's got 26 grams, it's a 42 gram protein.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.920]   Yeah, I don't wanna give a free ad to CorePower,
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.480]   but Sax, in addition to the antibodies
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.640]   that kicked RFK out of the Democratic Party,
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.880]   the press also blocked him.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.720]   CNN, et cetera, wouldn't let him on.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.480]   The right would let him on all day long.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.720]   Does this same antibody kind of system
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.040]   exist on the right at all,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.000]   or is the right more open to multiple candidates,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.520]   just generally speaking?
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.800]   - No, I mean, you look at Republican debates,
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.640]   and they are vigorous debates.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.080]   There is real disagreement on the right.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.440]   There are real debates on the right,
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   and there is a real working out of contested issues.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.080]   The Democratic Party, by and large, is a machine.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.520]   It works in lockstep.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.480]   That's why what Dean Phillips is doing is so sacrilegious.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   I mean, he is pretty much ending his career
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.640]   as someone who can just move up through the ranks
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.120]   that are the Democratic Party.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.320]   Maybe this will turn out in a way
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.600]   where it gives him like a leapfrog, but I don't think so.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.880]   I mean, I think he's basically signaling
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.080]   to the higher-ups in the Democratic Party
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.680]   that he's no longer a candidate
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.840]   for advancement through the regular course.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.680]   - Got it.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.200]   - And one analogy is that the Democratic Party
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.000]   is like the empire,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.720]   and the Republicans are like the rebel alliance.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.200]   The Republican Party is a bunch of misfits.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.520]   It's a bunch of discontents.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.360]   - Ewoks.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.200]   - Ewoks.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.040]   (both laughing)
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.880]   - Pan solos.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.240]   - Pan solos, whatever,
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.760]   but the Democratic Party marches in lockstep.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.560]   - Is that why the Democratic Party wins more,
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.920]   is because they're in lockstep?
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.760]   - Yeah.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.080]   They're much better fundraisers.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.240]   They're more disciplined.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.120]   They have their act together right now.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.440]   I don't think this was always the case,
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.960]   but I think it's true right now.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.520]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.800]   Well, we had a couple of other issues we wanted to get to,
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.640]   so I think we can wrap there.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.520]   Great job, everybody.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.480]   That was spectacular.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.280]   Great job getting the candidate, Chamath.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.120]   Thank you for that.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.400]   All right, we have to touch on what happened this week
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.240]   with the US and China relations.
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.600]   Everybody knows Xi Jinping was here in the Bay Area
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.320]   to meet with Biden.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:24.320]   Yellen welcomed Xi at the plane.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.080]   Maybe she's selling some treasuries, I don't know.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.720]   - That's what the press said.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.800]   - Yeah.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.560]   - I mean, we're like some sort of piss-poor company
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.800]   that's selling us junk bonds.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.000]   I mean, the second that Xi gets off the plane,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.760]   she's hawking our shitty bonds.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.680]   - Wow, listen, everybody's raising a fund right now.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.040]   You know, fundraising's hard.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.240]   - Did you guys hear the commentary
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.320]   that the Treasury auction had a really tough,
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.280]   tough moment last week?
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.120]   They had a big auction on, what was it,
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.160]   10 and 30-year bonds.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.680]   The 30-year bond bid was not really there.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.920]   And so they gotta get buyers in the market.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:55.760]   They gotta go get the China.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.680]   - And she's coming to raise money apparently too.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.560]   She's here.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:01.240]   Everybody's having a hard time raising right now.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.640]   Pretty crazy.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.240]   But Chamath, you and I tweeted about this clip
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.360]   where Xi Jinping said that, you know,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.160]   he's basically for peace and that we have to work together.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.400]   Let me just start there with you, Chamath,
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.480]   so we can get through this quickly.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.760]   Do you take him at his word?
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.240]   There were cynical people saying like,
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.880]   "Hey, you know, he's just desperate,
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.640]   needs more trade, needs more business."
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.560]   How do you interpret Xi's peace pipe here, you know,
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.520]   and his dinner with a bunch of executives last night?
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.760]   - I think he's pragmatic.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.800]   He's somebody that wants to not just rule over China,
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.760]   but he wants to do it for the rest of his life
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.160]   and he wants to do a good job.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.320]   And I've said this many times,
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.440]   China's issues are endemic and pervasive
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.680]   and they're demographic.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.560]   And so he has huge structural issues
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.960]   that he has to fix in the Chinese economy.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.840]   And so I think all of this is just about him focusing
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.600]   on his priorities, which makes sense,
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.920]   which is really about domestic policy.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.880]   There's an enormous real estate issue
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.160]   that has to get sorted out.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.720]   There is a GDP issue that has to get sorted out.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.800]   There's a youth unemployment issue
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.160]   that has to get sorted out.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.400]   And then there's an aging and a birth rate
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.040]   and a replacement issue that has to get sorted out.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.960]   All of these things are enormous efforts.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.320]   And so I think he's pragmatic enough
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   to not also then add foreign misadventures to that plate.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:28.080]   And I think what you heard was him being very clear
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.720]   about just exactly that.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.040]   - Sax, what was your interpretation?
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.480]   There's so many jumping off points here.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.880]   You got foreign policy, you got TikTok, fentanyl.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.600]   I mean, there's a long list of issues,
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.680]   but does it feel like we're turning the corner on relations?
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.400]   Hey, they need us, we need them.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.440]   But what was your interpretation on all this?
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.080]   - Well, I think what's going on here
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.120]   is that the administration has its hands full with two wars.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.200]   They've still got this war in Europe over Ukraine,
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.280]   which is going very badly.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.080]   And now we have a new war in the Middle East
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.040]   that caught them completely by surprise.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.160]   Recall that literally a week or two before October 7th,
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.200]   you had Jake Sullivan saying
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.320]   that the Middle East has never been more peaceful.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.240]   So they absolutely did not anticipate what was coming.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.160]   And now we have half of our carrier groups
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.880]   in the Middle East positioned there
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.320]   in case this blows up into a wider regional war.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   So I think the simple fact of the matter
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.560]   is that the Biden administration,
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.320]   this is more than they can handle.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.360]   Or let's put it this way.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.400]   They're trying to put the China compete on hold.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.840]   They're trying to put it on ice
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.120]   while they figure out a way
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:32.640]   to rescue this losing effort in Ukraine
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.640]   and to prevent the situation in the Middle East
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.120]   from spiraling out of control.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.480]   It's just too much for them.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.840]   They don't have the bandwidth to deal with a war
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.600]   or conflict breaking out in the Asia Pacific.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.840]   So I think that's the Biden administration's motivation here
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.520]   is they're seeking to ease tensions
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.320]   because they're just too bandwidth constrained
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.160]   to deal with it.
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.280]   By the same token, I think Chamath is right
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.400]   that she realizes that he's got his hands full
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.440]   with domestic economic problems.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:04.400]   He doesn't need a ratcheting up of tensions
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.040]   with the United States right now.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:10.040]   And I would also add that on foreign policy,
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.120]   I think what you're seeing in his remarks
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:17.120]   is a return away from this kind of wolf warrior diplomacy
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.720]   that they had going on a few years ago
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.480]   where they were kind of saying these very bellicose things
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.400]   and they were kind of flexing their muscles
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.120]   in the Asia Pacific region.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.960]   That really backfired on them
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.160]   because it raised the hackles
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.840]   of all those other Asian countries
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.560]   and it was making it too easy for the United States
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.680]   to form a containment alliance against China.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.320]   So he's moving away from that type of wolf warrior rhetoric
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.200]   that got them nowhere.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.320]   And he's moved back to the rhetoric of a Deng Xiaoping
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:47.920]   who said that China's policy should be to bide its time
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.600]   and hide its light under a bushel.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.080]   In other words, just get stronger and stronger.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.720]   Don't let people get wise to how strong you are.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.760]   And then when the time is right, you will flex your muscles
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.520]   but just keep getting stronger.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.680]   And I think he's returned to that policy.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.200]   And you saw this with the Belt and Road Conference
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.440]   that in Beijing just a few weeks ago
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.280]   where you saw countries like Vietnam participating.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.200]   And I think that China, their strategy is now
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.640]   to try to use some honey to catch some flies
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.720]   as opposed to using this kind of bellicose rhetoric.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.640]   - And saber rattling.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.880]   And if we look at this chart,
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.240]   I think this chart speaks volumes, Friedberg.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.360]   Foreign investment into China
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.800]   has absolutely fallen off a cliff.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.440]   Indeed, the decoupling, the saber rattling,
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:41.040]   and other countries looking to have resiliency
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.760]   and not be dependent on China
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.360]   has obviously blown up in his lap.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.320]   What are your thoughts on foreign trade
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.640]   and our business relationship with China
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.280]   and their relationship with the West
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.280]   and the rest of the world?
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.080]   - This used to be a thing to do to make money.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.720]   And then it became a question mark
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.000]   of whether you can make money a couple of years ago.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   And now as of this year, I would argue you are a pariah
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.520]   if you are trying to invest in China
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.800]   or do any business in China.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.640]   It's almost like you can't do business with the enemy.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.800]   That's the tone shift that I think accelerated
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.720]   in the last 24 months.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.440]   And as that tone shift happened in the business community
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.880]   and the investment community,
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.600]   it obviously escalated the tenor
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.560]   of what is the broader relationship look like
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.960]   that I think catalyzed,
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.320]   hey, we got to simmer things down
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.080]   because we can't really afford or deal
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.080]   with that escalation right now.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.760]   But I don't know, I mentioned this to you guys.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.600]   I was at a conference this past summer,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.160]   the summer of 22, it was like,
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.840]   hey, maybe, when are things gonna get bad with China?
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.440]   To this summer, it's like,
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.800]   if you were doing business in China,
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.080]   you're trying to pick up pennies in front of a freight train.
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.000]   Like you're gonna get run over.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.400]   And it happened in one year.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.440]   That was my observation.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.280]   It was like this crazy shift.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.800]   - The chart shows that, right?
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.360]   - Yeah, and I could tell from the tone
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.000]   of what everyone was saying on stage,
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.800]   it was like universal.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.800]   There wasn't anyone that disagreed.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.200]   And similarly, as you guys know,
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.360]   we've heard this from both political parties in the US,
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.520]   it suddenly became the new new thing
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.520]   for Democrats and Republicans to denounce China,
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.720]   denounce investing in China,
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.680]   denounce doing business with China.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.920]   But too much too fast, I would argue,
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.480]   has led to an observation of the consequences.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.480]   It's a deeply coupled economic partner to the United States.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.640]   China is the largest buyer of US agricultural exports,
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.240]   $200 billion a year of farm products
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.840]   that we make get shipped out to China.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:44.200]   China is a major supplier to our electronics industry.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.120]   We don't need to recount all the relationships,
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.280]   but trying to decouple too quickly,
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.160]   trying to call China the enemy too fast,
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.480]   I think has led to a realization
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.840]   that that's not really attenable.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.520]   So I would argue that maybe this week has been a moment.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.920]   I don't know if it really changes the long-term trajectory,
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.480]   but it seems like it's certainly a very important
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.640]   and critical pause in the escalation.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.920]   One thing I wanted to comment,
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.240]   I think one of the biggest winners this week,
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.560]   I'd love your point of view on this guys,
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.880]   is like Gavin Newsom.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.640]   I mean, he was all over this week.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.280]   Like he was at the plane greeting Xi,
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.400]   he cleaned up San Francisco.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.240]   I mean, he was-
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.840]   - He got a shout out from the president.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.600]   - He was at the dinner.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.600]   I mean, do you guys think like Gavin is, you know,
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.360]   gonna be there when Joe says, "I'll see you later.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.440]   I'm not gonna run again."
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.760]   And the New Year when I spoke.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.880]   Yeah, what's happening here?
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.360]   - It's all just a big coincidence.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.800]   (laughing)
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.720]   - He actually went on stage in San Francisco,
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.920]   made all those comments about the city should be cleaned up
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.760]   and we haven't been doing it.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.080]   We could have the whole time.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:43.920]   He's very honest about it.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.200]   - Well, it's not quite what he said.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.640]   - Yeah, but I look, I mean, I don't know.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.480]   What do you guys think?
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.520]   - He's quasi owning it, right, Sax?
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.360]   Quasi owning it?
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.320]   - No, I don't think he did own it.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.640]   He gave these really weird remarks about how,
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.760]   there were some people that were saying
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.720]   that we're only cleaning up San Francisco
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:59.080]   because there's these fancy people here.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.760]   That was such a weird term as well.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.360]   - And it's true because it's true.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.600]   - And it's true, but yeah,
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.200]   it was like he was headed in one direction
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.580]   and then realized he was making a mistake,
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.840]   but couldn't quite figure out what to do about it.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.000]   - Let's pull it up, let's pull it up.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:10.840]   It's good.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.680]   - Yeah, here, play it.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.960]   - Folks say, "Oh, they're just cleaning up this place
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.240]   'cause all those fancy leaders are coming into town."
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.800]   That's true because it's true.
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.560]   (laughing)
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.080]   - What he's basically doing there is admitting
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.680]   that he as the governor has the power to snap his fingers
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.080]   and wave his magic wand
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.140]   and clean up the streets of San Francisco.
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:32.640]   And that is completely different
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.900]   than what he's been telling us for years.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.800]   For years, he's been maintaining
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.120]   that the problem of homelessness in California
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.840]   is owned by local officials or by judges
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.920]   or somehow by the system itself
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.220]   and is too complex and is beyond his power
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.840]   to simply do something about it.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.840]   But he just admitted that in fact,
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.520]   he does have the power to do something about it.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:55.400]   In fact, he is the boss of a one-party state
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.480]   and all he had to do was snap his fingers
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.720]   and make this homeless problem go away.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.440]   And he's willing to do that for Xi Jinping.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.140]   He's willing to do that for Dreamforce.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.540]   He's willing to do that for the Super Bowl,
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.200]   but he is not willing to do that
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:11.120]   for the ordinary citizens of San Francisco.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.320]   And I think that ultimately
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.600]   is gonna be a huge vulnerability.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.160]   What he should have said here is,
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.800]   it's true that we cleaned up the city
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.360]   to represent ourselves well
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.160]   for these foreign leaders who are coming in.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.560]   But the truth of it is
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   that we should be doing this every day.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.000]   And here's my agenda for fixing it, point one, two, three.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.040]   And if we could get everyone on board with this agenda,
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.520]   we could fix this problem.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:35.680]   But that's not what he said.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.200]   What he basically communicated was
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.040]   that I can solve this problem anytime,
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:43.120]   but I don't give a shit about you ordinary citizens.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.640]   We only do this for the fancy people.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.280]   - Chamath, any reaction to that?
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.360]   - He's auditioning.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.120]   I mean, I think that much is clear.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.240]   Again, I would just say,
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.760]   you can't just go to China and meet with Xi Jinping.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.600]   So that has to be endorsed, it's negotiated, it's enabled.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.520]   You go there with talking points,
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.160]   you go there in discussion with state and treasury
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.760]   and the rest of the federal bureaucracy behind you.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:12.440]   So that was a clear audition of some kind.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.440]   And I think it was obvious that they wanted the APEC summit
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:24.240]   to be the backdrop of a Biden-Xi meeting.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.120]   And so you're doubling down on California.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.120]   So I think it's kind of like a dry run here,
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.080]   is what I would say.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.360]   I mean, I'm not sure that it's, I don't know what for.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:36.600]   - It definitely made him look presidential.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   And I think you're right that when he went to China
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.960]   a few weeks ago to invite Xi to the summit,
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.080]   that was clearly sanctioned by, it gotta be,
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.720]   by Blinken, by Sullivan, by the-
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.840]   - Of course, you can't do that on your own.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.800]   - Of course, of course.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.000]   But again, the reason why they sanctioned that
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.800]   is because they really want to ease tensions
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.640]   with China right now,
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.240]   given how full their hands are
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.840]   with the Middle East right now and with Ukraine.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.640]   - No, no, no, I'm not debating that.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.720]   I think that that makes all the sense in the world.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.120]   I think that you could have sent any number of,
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.000]   well, not any number,
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.720]   but one of three cabinet secretaries,
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.680]   and it would have been just as appropriate.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.000]   And I think sending the governor,
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.040]   I think was a little bit of a, it was a test.
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.680]   Can he perform?
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.040]   And I think he did a good job there.
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:17.960]   - He helped himself.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.800]   I mean, he hurt himself with,
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.800]   it's true because it's true,
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.680]   but he helped himself in terms of the optics
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.520]   of a daring presidential-
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.360]   - Can I say it though?
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.960]   I think he did look presidential in China.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.120]   And I actually, that was the first time
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.600]   where I thought Gavin was really being a normal person
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.240]   'cause he actually told the truth.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.780]   He's like, yeah, this state is a,
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.000]   at its best. - A mess.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.400]   - No, but this state at its best
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.720]   is a center of innovation in the future.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.760]   And at its worst,
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.800]   it's where every bad progressive idea goes to die.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.120]   - But wait, he said that?
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.080]   - No, no, no, I'm saying that.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.040]   I'm saying San Francisco embodies both of those two things.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.960]   On one day, it's full of people on crystal meth and fentanyl.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.400]   On the second day, it's the open AI dev day.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:02.120]   - Yeah, we'll take the president-
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.320]   - Within a block of each other.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.000]   So I think, and I think he just admitted-
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.160]   - But imagine if he said something like that,
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.060]   that would make him so much more real.
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.960]   - Well, maybe he's trying to find his voice.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.240]   - I think his tone has shifted a bit.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.080]   I don't know.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:15.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.480]   It felt like in seeing some of the talks he gave this week
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.520]   and his positioning and where he was sitting,
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:22.400]   it was, he looks like very legit.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.720]   - I definitely will say that the Gavin Newsom
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.680]   of three years ago was a little bit smarmy
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.200]   and more of like a political insider.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.640]   The Gavin Newsom of like the last week
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.800]   and particularly even just that comment to me, David,
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:41.080]   was actually being honest.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.280]   And I think that that's a more viable path
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.640]   if they decide to give him the candidacy,
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.480]   which I think-
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480]   - I think that's a really good observation
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.320]   because he could just come out and say,
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.880]   "Listen, we tried a bunch of things.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.800]   We had good intent.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.860]   It didn't work.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:57.320]   And now we're reversing them."
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.320]   But Biden did say that he would possibly be running
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.760]   for his job.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.400]   I want to thank Governor Newsom, want to thank him.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.280]   He's been one hell of a governor, man.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:11.040]   Matter of fact, he could be anything he wants.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.160]   He could have the job I'm looking for.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.160]   I don't know if you guys heard that quote from Biden.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.280]   Biden said that last night.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.040]   So I guess conspiracy,
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:22.280]   let's put our tinfoil hat corner time.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.640]   This actually your favorite.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.200]   Percentage chance Biden runs or drops out,
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.320]   whichever way you want to do it.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:31.880]   Anybody have some teeling to this?
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.040]   - I still think there's about a 70% chance that Biden runs.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.880]   - Okay, so 30% chance he doesn't.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.960]   - He's not gonna voluntarily retire.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.280]   The party apparatus, whoever's behind the scenes
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.000]   pulling the strings, the Wizard of Oz is gonna have to go,
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.960]   the party elders have to go to him at a certain point
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.600]   and say, "Sorry, this is just not gonna work."
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.360]   And we're not there yet.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.040]   - Okay, Chamath, what do you think?
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:56.880]   I'm curious.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:57.720]   - I think David's right.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:58.540]   The leaders and the powers that be
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:00.280]   will not make that call right now.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.880]   I don't think it's time yet.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.240]   - Freeberg, you got a take?
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:05.400]   - I don't know.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.400]   I think it's speculation.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.560]   I really don't know.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.400]   - Okay.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.440]   Hey, Chamath, one question here just on markets.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.760]   Hundreds of billions of dollars not being invested in China
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.920]   on that chart for investments.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.520]   Where does that money go?
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:18.680]   Any thoughts on where that's going?
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.600]   Is it sitting in accounts?
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.320]   You think it's being invested in other geographies?
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.000]   - We talked about it last week with Jared Kushner,
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.160]   but if you look at just the ton of cash and cash equivalents,
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.080]   I think it just speaks to how everybody's
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.720]   just a little bit on the sidelines waiting to go,
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.000]   waiting for the green light,
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.680]   which you saw CPI this week, by the way.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:40.240]   I mean, we talked about it last week,
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.800]   which is that it looked like CPI is turning over.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.320]   And now the consensus forecast is you're gonna see CPI
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.440]   with a low 2% handle by February or March of this year.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:52.360]   So you're gonna see 2.2% CPI or something.
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:53.880]   Watch out.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.140]   - Watch out as in, hey, markets could come roaring back.
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.080]   Maybe not Zerp environment, but could get interesting.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.760]   All right, listen, we don't wanna leave
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.640]   without doing a science corner.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.160]   Everybody loves science corner.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.160]   I know DeepMind has been working on many projects,
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.180]   Freeburg, and DeepMind, of course, is Google's AI arm.
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:16.580]   They did Go, they did protein folding,
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:18.600]   and of course they're doing BARD,
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.120]   but they announced something this week
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.840]   about predicting weather.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.240]   Tell us about this paper that was released, Freeburg.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:26.760]   - Yeah, so I think this was pretty exciting.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.920]   You guys know I used to work in weather.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.520]   When I ran Climate Corp, we did a lot of work
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.300]   with weather forecasting and weather modeling.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:37.840]   So DeepMind published a paper in the journal Science
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.300]   this week, introducing GraphCast,
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.880]   which is actually a publicly available model
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.880]   that does weather forecasting using machine learned models.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.760]   It's a 37 million parameter model,
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.080]   just to give you a sense how small that is.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.640]   That model compared to a chat GPT,
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.320]   which is like 1.5 trillion parameters in the chat GPT model.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:02.160]   This is only 37 million parameters in this model.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.080]   And the performance that they got out of GraphCast,
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:06.360]   which they published in the journal,
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:09.080]   so they've made the model available, you can check it out.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.000]   You can read the paper on how they built the model.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.920]   They're very open about that.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.200]   And the model actually forecasts weather
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.760]   over a 10 day period,
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.200]   better than traditional weather forecasting.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.840]   So let me just talk about how weather forecasting
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.080]   is normally done, and what they did differently,
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.180]   and why this is such a big breakthrough.
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:27.320]   So weather forecasting is usually done
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.000]   by kind of chopping up the atmosphere
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.160]   into little cubes, little blocks.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:34.840]   And the weather is a fluid, it's like a liquid.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.600]   It's air and moisture being moved around with energy.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.640]   And so normal weather forecasting systems
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:43.520]   are what are called numerical models.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.660]   You run physics, you run the formulas for physics
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.680]   on each of those little cells of the atmosphere
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:50.560]   and figure out how they affect the cell next to them
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.860]   and the cell next to them.
[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:53.800]   And you run that cycle forward,
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.340]   and you run all these calculations,
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:56.840]   and then you figure out how those cells
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.920]   are gonna be different in hours,
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.560]   and then in days going forward.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.080]   And these numerical models,
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.520]   basically because they're compute intensive,
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.960]   they're running actual calculations from physics
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.440]   to model all this stuff,
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.860]   they require a lot of compute power.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:15.500]   There are hundreds of variables that are measured
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:18.400]   and that are output from forecasting models.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.320]   And they're generally run
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.300]   on these very expensive compute clusters.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:27.200]   There are two major weather forecasting systems.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:30.120]   One is run by ECMWF, which is the European Weather Center,
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.520]   and the other one is run by NOAA called GFS here in the US.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.400]   And ECMWF runs on a million cores
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.160]   across 7,700 compute cluster nodes.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.960]   They spent about $200 million on this compute cluster.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:47.800]   And the GFS model runs on a 29 petaflop system.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.240]   So 29 quadrillion floating operations per second,
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:53.680]   it costs $270 million.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.620]   And when they run the forecast model
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.560]   using this traditional way of doing things,
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.200]   they're running all these physics calculations
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:01.600]   on these little small blocks of the atmosphere
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.120]   and perturbing it.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.600]   Fast forward, try and capture as much data
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.500]   out of the model runs as they can.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.760]   And every six hours, they run the model,
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.280]   and there's a new output every six hours.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.880]   And it costs a billion dollars
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.680]   for NOAA to run forecasts every year
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.200]   and disseminate that information.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.320]   And then all the weather companies,
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.120]   you know, from Weather Channel and AccuWeather,
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:23.340]   they're all buying or getting free access to these forecasts
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:25.560]   that come from these big compute clusters.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.280]   And that's how all weather forecasting is done.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.920]   They're actually done primarily
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.400]   by these big centralized government super compute clusters.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.840]   And then they're made available for everyone to consume.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.500]   And the more data and the more compute you get,
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:42.160]   the better the forecasts, the higher the resolution,
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.720]   meaning the more local space you can forecast on,
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:45.880]   the smaller the timescales,
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.680]   meaning you can go from one day forecast
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.620]   to one hour forecast, break it down.
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.080]   And the further out you can be accurate,
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.280]   whether it's five days and then 10 days and so on.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.160]   So more compute has been the name of the game
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.480]   for many, many years in weather forecasting.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.280]   The more compute you get, the better the forecasts.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:03.080]   So this breakthrough that DeepMind has had
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:05.360]   is they basically took all the past weather forecasts
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.720]   and they built a model that figured out
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.720]   how to take the current weather
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:12.920]   and the weather from six hours ago, just the data.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.240]   So the data feeds from today's current weather,
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.780]   weather six hours ago,
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:18.640]   and trained a model that predicted weather
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.160]   for the next 10 days.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.320]   The same output as you would get
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.280]   from these big expensive numerical models.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.440]   And they did this using what's called
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.120]   a graph neural network.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.020]   That's the architecture for the model.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.280]   A graph neural network is far more complicated
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:35.200]   than say, predicting an image, which is two dimensional,
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.820]   it's pixels next to each other,
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:40.360]   or predicting a text stream, which is one dimensional,
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.200]   it's what's the next word in a sentence.
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.340]   So these are, a graph neural network
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:46.360]   is a fairly complicated model.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.880]   And so they describe all the techniques they use
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.520]   and everything they built in the paper,
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.720]   they were really open about it all.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.200]   And then they were able to train this model
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.480]   using past, you know, forecasting data
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.360]   going back to the 70s.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.480]   And then they ran the model.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.240]   If you pull up these charts,
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.360]   so the first chart that we're going to pull up here,
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.280]   basically shows the models performance graph cast
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.000]   against the big ECMWF model.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.720]   And what you'll see is that the model
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.240]   across all timescales going out to 10 days is better.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.840]   And there's a bunch of ways to measure this,
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.140]   primarily what's called root mean square error,
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:21.280]   which measures the skill of the forecast.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.440]   So here you can see the black line
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.240]   is the numerical model run by ECMWF,
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.800]   which is the big weather forecast model
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.400]   that most people in the world rely on every day.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.640]   And the bottom is the machine learn model.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:38.200]   And by the way, the entire graph cast model
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.360]   runs in one minute.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:42.400]   So you basically input current weather data
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.360]   and you input weather data from six hours ago
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.440]   and in a minute, you get all the forecasts.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.280]   Whereas currently-
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.840]   - And it could run on what?
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.600]   Like a smartphone or a laptop?
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.080]   It's such a small-
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.200]   - Not that small, but yeah,
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.920]   I mean, you could run it on a small compute
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.680]   and you could get the results in a minute.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.680]   And so basically everyone can now be a weather forecaster.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.520]   What used to be-
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:05.880]   - Is the gap between the black and the blue line significant?
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.280]   Is that an important-
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.000]   - It is significant in two ways.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.200]   One is, first of all, it's better, which is amazing,
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.880]   because researchers have spent billions of dollars
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.600]   and decades trying to make their numerical models better.
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:18.120]   So the fact that a machine learn model
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.920]   is just simply better is really profound.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:24.120]   And the second point is that this machine learn model
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:27.600]   is only 37 million parameters and can be output in a minute.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.920]   So you could be running this thing continuously.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:30.880]   And you can be-
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.960]   - Does this work for weather all around the world
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:34.480]   or just in a specific-
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.720]   - Exactly, all around the world.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:36.960]   And the second thing that they measured,
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:39.760]   if you pull up the second graph, was, well, okay, great,
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:42.520]   you can measure, you can do basic weather forecasting,
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:45.560]   but are you good at picking up extreme events?
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.360]   The things that are really outside
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.760]   of the normal distribution curve,
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.080]   the things that we should worry about,
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:53.680]   like cyclones or extreme heat or atmospheric rivers.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:56.360]   And the answer, again, is absolutely yes,
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.280]   that this model trained on this data
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:02.640]   is better at forecasting extreme weather events.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:05.160]   - On that bottom left one, is it saying that HRS
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.480]   doesn't actually predict cyclone tracking
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.760]   and that GraphCast gives you like two, three,
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.960]   four days lead time?
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:13.400]   - That's just an error difference.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:14.240]   Yeah, it's just a measure.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:15.920]   It's a measure of delta.
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:17.400]   - So what's the downstream effect of this?
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.040]   People will be able to get out of an area
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.680]   that could have extreme weather or insurance.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.040]   You did climate.com, right?
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.960]   So you've been in this business for a long time.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:28.320]   - Yeah, so I think one of the most interesting things
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.440]   is how this is gonna change
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.720]   how weather forecasting is done.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.840]   Again, billions of dollars.
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.520]   There's a big system in Japan, a big system in Europe,
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.960]   and a big system in the US that forecasts the weather.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.720]   There's some of the biggest compute clusters in the world.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:42.600]   And now you can run it in your home.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:44.200]   You can run this model in your home
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.080]   'cause all the weather data that is the input to the model
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:49.560]   is available all the time on the internet for free.
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.480]   So we could just take that data and anyone could run it.
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:53.920]   You could get faster results, more frequent updates,
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.720]   certainly a much lower cost.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.560]   And I think this is just the beginning
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.400]   of obviously a long road of optimization and iteration
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.480]   that will go from here,
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.040]   where it'll be really amazing to see what else can be done
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:05.880]   with this model.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:07.920]   It totally upends a lot of different business models
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.200]   as well.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.880]   What's really important also to note,
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.520]   this is an incredible proof point
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:14.360]   of these graph neural nets.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:17.000]   Graph neural nets can be applied in other areas
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.760]   like chemistry, biology, material science,
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.120]   anywhere where you're simulating physics
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:25.160]   or physical properties or three-dimensional space over time,
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.000]   showing that you can train off data
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.680]   and be better than physical models
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.640]   that just use physics to make a prediction.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.240]   And you can just have the machine figure out
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.080]   how to do it on its own,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.400]   and it comes up with this prediction
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.480]   that's better than running physics in a compute cluster.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.320]   It's really incredible.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:41.600]   And I think it'll also,
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.280]   it's a great way to highlight the opportunity
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.160]   for machine learning models being applied to things
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.400]   like chemistry and biology for discovery purposes
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.640]   and other areas over time.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.560]   I thought it was a great paper,
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:56.160]   another really incredible proof point by DeepMind.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:58.320]   - I mean, are they going to just throw away those clusters
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.400]   running those other weather models now?
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.800]   - Dude, I'm telling you, like that's-
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:02.640]   - Redundant.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:03.920]   - And by the way, talk about accountability.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.920]   So if I'm running the Department of Commerce,
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.320]   which oversees NOAA in the US,
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.160]   I'm like, what are we doing?
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.760]   We're making a billion dollars a year on this now.
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.120]   We can just run this thing on a MacBook.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.640]   - So a perfect example of how AI
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:15.200]   is going to save billions of dollars.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:16.760]   This is like an incredible proof point
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.240]   for the government getting more efficient
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.160]   to circle back around to Dean's point earlier in the episode.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.200]   Okay, this has been an amazing episode.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.400]   For the dictator himself, Jamal Palihapitiya.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   - I want a more accurate forecast
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.080]   of the temperature on Uranus.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.680]   - Oh, it was coming in at any moment.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.880]   Oh man.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.720]   - It depends.
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:35.560]   Did you have-
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:36.400]   - It's cold and dark.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.240]   - Cold and dark.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.080]   - It's cold and dark.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:38.920]   Or maybe you had the hot sauce.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.760]   Anybody knows.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.600]   All right, listen.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.640]   And for the sultan of science,
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.320]   the day after tomorrow, beautiful,
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:46.120]   it was a great fun movie, David Friedberg.
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.440]   And the rain man, David Sachs.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.520]   I'm amongst the world's greatest moderators.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.440]   Great job the last two weeks, Friedberg.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:57.160]   And this is your favorite podcast,
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:58.120]   the All In Podcast.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.480]   We'll see you all next time.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.320]   Bye-bye.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.160]   - Bye-bye.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:04.720]   Oh, also, also, also happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.040]   - Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.440]   - Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.840]   - No episode next week.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.680]   - No episode next week.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.320]   - You never know, somebody goes rogue.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:12.160]   You know what I mean?
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.280]   - Happy Thanksgiving to everybody.
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:15.920]   - Gobble, gobble.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:17.400]   - Lots of you said gobble.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:18.640]   Make me thankful for your blessings.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:19.480]   Gobble.
