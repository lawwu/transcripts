[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.320]   for talenti and i saw how people just immediately were attracted to it and fell in love with it
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.680]   and i thought hey when i ran for congress i'm going to do the same thing so i created the

[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.360]   are running for president yeah well i'll tell you after being in the vodka business and the ice
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.000]   cream business and actually the coffee business i think i understand at least what americans want so
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.320]   that's a good start uh well i'll tell you a little about my background why i'm here i lost my dad in
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.920]   the vietnam war when i was just six months old i had grew up with no money in st paul minnesota
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.280]   i earned an rotc scholarship on behalf of the federal government of course to pursue his
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.600]   education i went to vietnam in 1968 just before i was born i got to see the u.s land on the moon and
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.680]   i think regularly about how he looked up two days before his helicopter crashed and he died looked
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.040]   up and saw americans on the moon and looked down and saw america at its worst and literally that
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.880]   experience in no small way is what brings me to this day and i was six months old my mom was 24
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.240]   and widowed and we moved in with my great grandparents for the first three years of my life
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.000]   and i got lucky when i was three my mom married a wonderful extraordinary man who adopted me eddie
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.400]   phillips brought me into a family of great blessings my grandmother became dear abby
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   and my aunt ann landers so i grew up in a family of a lot of
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.720]   advice and i've lived on both sides of the advantage and i recognize it i remember the
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.920]   day i turned 26 and i counted the days that my father had lived my birth father and i remember
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.600]   the day after i had lived as many days as him my life changed forever and i i became inspired
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   joined our family business after college i ended up running our beverage business we created
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.520]   belvedere vodka which we sold to lvmh and then got into the ice cream business and did the
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   same thing you guys created belvedere yeah we my father and i and our partner steve gill
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.560]   went on a trip to poland in 1993 hoping to sell them phillips schnapps which we made in minnesota
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.080]   we thought eastern europe was ready for peppermint and peach shops and and we we're touring
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.280]   distilleries and we see both in in duty free in the airport and in the distilleries the most
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.920]   beautiful packaging we had ever seen in the spirits business now mind you this is when
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.360]   absolute and stoli were like the pinnacle of luxury right fifteen dollars
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.720]   dollar you know average now and my father immediately yeah sat at a restaurant that night
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.440]   literally this is a literal napkin story he on a napkin created a little matrix and said if stoli
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.400]   and absolute are fifteen dollars and they're the most premium in a fast-growing category why
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   shouldn't there be a 25 vodka and why should this not be it so we negotiated with the polish
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.560]   government our partner tad dorda from poland helped us and we first obtained the distribution
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.880]   rights and then when poland privatized their
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   spirits industry we acquired the distillery and the ip and the rest was history and you know cork
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.040]   finish beautiful bottle we sold it we talked about the lowest common denominator the pens we used to
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.880]   write the orders the way we carried it made all the difference in the world and then we used that
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.040]   same template in ice cream because what we found is in every category of every consumer product
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.320]   category in which there are two main competitors coke and pepsi stoli absolute ben and jerry's and
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.860]   haagen-dazs they tend to fight to the bottom of the ice cream line and they're not going to win
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.960]   the bottom lower pricing um you know frankly um demeaning consumers and there's always an
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.880]   opportunity to introduce something a little bit more premium a little bit more special that's
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.840]   still an affordable luxury and belvedere by the way was built by jay-z i can tell you that story
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.240]   if you want to hear it it's an extraordinary one yeah yeah tell that story yeah yeah so so so far
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.800]   you're like you're our kind of candidate we're like exactly yeah you just got four votes apparently
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.640]   we're all looking at you like who is this guy this is awesome yeah so when people ask me about my
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.020]   platform i'll say i'll be a storyteller about vodka i'm ready to start popping bottles over here
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.660]   by the way that's exactly what jay-z did sax and i popped many a belvedere bottle in when we had our
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.900]   run in l.a true or not true sex it was a tough choice between belvedere and gray goose oh i'll
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.100]   tell you that story too by the way anyway so we introduced belvedere and it and by the way what
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.940]   we learned in hindsight is that our aperture was way too small you know we were way too we we sold
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.620]   it by the bottle not by the case we only went to restaurants and bars and we sold it to the
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.580]   bars at first not to the big stores we wanted to be special and we completely underestimated the
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.220]   size of what this category could be sydney frank who introduced gray goose took a much bigger
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.820]   approach anyway so i'm sitting at home getting ready for work one day i have mtv on and it's
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.980]   probably a year after we introduced belvedere it's doing well but not not big so sorry this
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:45.540]   is like mid 90s yeah i can't remember the year chamath it's probably you know 95 yeah yeah 90
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.600]   thereabouts i'm watching mtv i see a jay-z video and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna watch that video
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.560]   and it is all belvedere it's in the fridge he's holding it there are people dancing he's pouring
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.640]   it on him and i froze called my dad immediately who of course didn't have mtv on and and i said
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.160]   you got to turn it on he couldn't find the channel i'm like hey dad you know mtv repeats the same
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.280]   videos you know five ten times a day so we got to the office and sure enough we had the tv on
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.880]   it came back on the whole company gathered at that time we were probably 10 people
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.580]   and we gathered around the tv and watched this video and i'm telling you guys within two weeks
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:27.500]   the brand completely popped and my dad jay-z ended up calling my father they had a dinner in new york
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.480]   city uh a memorable one for both actually he ended up introducing a vodka some years later called
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.320]   armadale uh right and it failed miserably but it was one of the first times that i think in this
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.740]   new culture of influencers and celebrity endorsers that that magic happened he almost literally
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.560]   made belvedere so that's the story did you guys sign him to a deal and pay him money or
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.540]   no no in fact we talked about that and the core so this is the brand foundation of the brand house
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.220]   was authenticity we didn't do a damn thing that had anything to do with anything that wasn't true
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.860]   the makers of it the product itself we didn't we didn't pay people to talk about it unlike sydney
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.500]   frank with gray goose so we chose not to it was all natural and then here's the other cool thing
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.980]   and this is how my campaign is going to work we sent 200 bottles in very special beautiful boxes
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.700]   to
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.280]   200 influencers we we believe that if we could simply seed the brand with 200 people all around
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.680]   the us that they could be the content makers and the advocates the ambassadors in fact
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   one of them went to this guy right behind me bill clinton and robert de niro another example
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.360]   robert redford you know leaders of industry and actors and and uh and the like robert de
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.320]   niro gets one of these things and there's a note inside with a picture of the distiller
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.520]   bogdan zedlensky it said watch page three the tiffany section i'm sorry the tiffany
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.620]   location of the wall street journal on call it it was like monday february 6th to only 200 people
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.500]   knew what was coming the ad in the paper didn't show a bottle of anything it just said belvedere
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.140]   bogdan wants to know how you like it so we literally did an ad that cost gosh knows back
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.180]   then probably a hundred thousand dollars tiny little top corner ad that spoke to 200 people
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.820]   in the united states of america that had no idea nobody else knew what it was robert de niro goes
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.500]   to the beverly hills hotel or the peninsula i can't remember ordered a bottle of water and he
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.120]   orders a belvedere martini soon thereafter the barman says mr de niro we have absolute we have
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.200]   stoli i don't have that brand and he says i don't think you heard me i want a belvedere martini
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.020]   so the barman sends like the bar back to whatever the the wine and spirit shop is on rodeo driver
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.800]   in beverly hills and the guy he comes back with a bottle and the entire bar watched this little
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.540]   episode and i'm telling you once again within a week that store was selling through belvedere
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.480]   like it was water so these little moments where you identify the right people
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.500]   and now mind you this is in the analog era there was no internet there was no social media this was
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.140]   people simply talking to people so we sold belvedere to lvmh and then we looked at the
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.980]   ice cream category ben and jerry's doing the same thing if you can tell us about that what
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:09.100]   is it like to negotiate against lvmh and bernard arnaud and why do you sell it when it's working
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.960]   i guess maybe it's a question you know i'll tell you well this is not a story i've shared with many
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.500]   they were very disingenuous
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.860]   and uh it it deeply troubles me to this day uh the way that my father was treated
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   the promises that were made simply to get a deal done and then not kept
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:35.060]   i think is a reflection on principle and i'll leave it at that a lesson learned in fact rather
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.500]   than going through a competitive process which i think any enterprise would do to maximize value of
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:48.020]   a brand our family ethos was a little different and and i think we bit and in hindsight it was a
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.440]   mistake
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   but i'll leave it at that you learn less you know what you learn lessons every experience to this
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.440]   very day i'm learning them every day on the campaign trail too that was one i would never
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.200]   make again all right well you got the two david's votes with the vodka you got mine with the gelato
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.440]   and if you launch a luxury fabric brand or sweaters i think you're going to get your mom first i got
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.680]   some other work to do for eight years so we'll do that afterwards i'll just wrap this long story up
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.120]   so we introduced you know talenti obviously does well we sold it to unilever then i opened a couple
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.420]   coffee shops with my family in minneapolis thank you so much for joining me today and i'm going to
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.800]   be a little bit more of a fun guy i'm thinking this would be kind of a fun folly and then we're
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.000]   watching the 2016 election uh at home uh i thought it would wake up the next morning we'd have hillary
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.280]   clinton as president not that that was thrilling to the world but it would have been safe and lo and
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.720]   behold you know what happened and i remember telling my family that night like look give the
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.840]   guy a chance he's not going to act like that in the white house the presidency changes you it
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.080]   humbles you it moderates you and my family thought i was a you know i was a joke and i woke up the
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.840]   next morning my 16 year old was in her room crying my 18 year old was a freshman at college we
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.640]   facetimed her and she's crying and i sat at the breakfast table guys and i promised my daughters
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.040]   i would do something i raised them to be participants not not observers and i looked around
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.400]   at my district i thought maybe i'll run for congress i looked around and uh i hadn't the
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.160]   district had not been won by a democrat since the 1958 election this is now we're looking at the 2018
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.060]   election 60 years and i'm going to be a part of the election and i'm going to be a part of the election
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.900]   and the man who had won won his fourth term by 14 points and people told me i was crazy you know
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.460]   you're out of your mind you're giving up a good life to run for misery and you'll never make it
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.420]   and you'll embarrass yourself which is why i did it and not only did we win we won by 12 points we
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.940]   had fun we used invitation not confrontation and i drove that little van all around the district to
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.860]   the most unhospitable parts i opened the service window i served coffee and i sat i put two chairs
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.040]   out and people would just come up and talk and i found me and my wife and my wife and my wife
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.520]   magic in just letting people share what's on their mind they're so unheard anyhow i get to well i can
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.280]   tell you now i want to tell you why i'm doing it but that's the story of where i came from and why
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.960]   i'm doing this and look at the end of the day i'm the one of those that got lucky you know there's a
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.920]   lot of kids who lost their dads in vietnam who did not have the magical moment that i had to be
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   adopted by an amazing father and that was the difference for me it's my job to make sure others
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:15.240]   get that same chance simple as that before we jump into the future about why you're running and what
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.480]   you what you see for the country talk about the years that you spent in congress what did you
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.600]   observe there what what is it like day to day and what do you think is working and what isn't working
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:34.680]   i wish we had three hours i get there chamath i get there the first week of 2019 and like all
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.720]   of you that come from organizational enterprise experience i assume that nancy pelosi and kevin
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.440]   mccarthy would have a have a strategy to introduce the new members of congress both
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.520]   democrats and republicans you know get to know each other do a ropes course you know and build
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.480]   some trust or something and my goodness it was just the opposite guys we were put on separate
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.320]   buses going to different events and i realized right away that they had a systemic segregation
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.440]   strategy on day one and you know what i mean sincerely the two parties this is
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.360]   i'll tell you what i've learned we've talked more about this the only people that want to
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.760]   protect the status quo of the duopoly and the political industrial complex that just surrounds
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.360]   it all are the two parties the two parties are the two parties the two parties are the two parties
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.720]   and it is destructive and i will get into that but i recognize right away all of my colleagues that
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.000]   the leadership in both uh democratic and republican side they wanted to keep us separate
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.280]   they did not want to give us education and information and they wanted to keep us so busy
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.560]   that we could not become threats to their power structure
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.920]   you can imagine members of congress tend to be pretty ambitious people and ultimately
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.280]   they were smart to do that because they made members of congress they do this to
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.920]   stay raise raise money all week long 10 000 hours per week is what senators and house members spend
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.200]   raising money i've got a bill actually that would preclude it from 8 a.m to 5 p.m because it's such
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.520]   an unmitigated joke and disaster the fact that in the united states that a pack representing a
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:08.440]   special interest or corporation can hand a five thousand dollar check to a member of congress
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.200]   at a steakhouse on wednesday evening and then that member serves on a committee in which that's
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.560]   a business or special interest has business in front of the next day is the most unbelievable
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.480]   form of legal corruption you could possibly imagine so that's one needless to say i resolved
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.080]   right after that first week of orientation that i would do it differently i befriended
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.360]   my republican colleagues my wife annalise and i started having bipartisan dinners at our house
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.040]   i joined the problem solvers caucus i hope you guys know about it it's the most important
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.120]   small caucus in congress we're now 32 democrats and 32 republicans committed to doing what we're
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.240]   supposed to do get to know each other talk policy and try to make a difference now we're the work
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.200]   horses not the show horses so you don't know most of our names including me but we were the ones
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.040]   invited to the white house uh in like week three of our service i was one of four democrats there
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.960]   were four republicans that president trump invited to the situation room
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.600]   to make a proposition to get us through the shutdown which i can talk about that
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.040]   bizarre hour of my life as well um and that's how i resolved to do it now i'm ranked depending on
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.480]   the the survey number one number two number ten uh most bipartisan members of the entire
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:25.720]   u.s congress and including governors uh and and i vote relatively progressive it's not about just
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.680]   the votes it's about the ethos it's about uh republican sponsored bills that come from me
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.160]   it's about me sponsoring republican-led bills uh and that's what makes me a little bit different
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.080]   than i think just about every member of congress not to mention i think i'm the only one that's
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.960]   willing to torpedo a career so that the country isn't torpedoed
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.160]   by this nonsense and dysfunction um there's a lot more to talk about but the it all starts
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.200]   with a systematic segregation and a focus on fighting each other instead of fighting for
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.160]   each other i can talk about it all day long let's start there dean what give us the assessment of
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.680]   what's happening in the white house right now before we talk about your candidacy just like
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.640]   what's going on well let me just say i respect president biden
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   i he's a man i've had in my house uh for an event he's a man with whom i've flown on air force one
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:19.640]   or two times he did a beautiful video for my daughter he called my mother um i think he did
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.720]   a fine job i think he was the only man that could have defeated donald trump in 2020 and i have to
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.520]   say i think it's fair to say too he's probably the only democrat who could and will lose to
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:39.480]   donald trump in 2024. he's a human being he's now in his 80s he is clearly on the decline
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.800]   he's not incompetent i believe he's surrounded himself by competent able principled people who
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.120]   are able to do what he wants to do and i believe the white house is running as a team as most do
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.480]   but do i think that he will be in a position to continue leading this country in the future i do
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.440]   not i think i'm joined by about 75 percent in the country of the country in saying that i also
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.400]   believe the policies that we passed for the most part are investments for the future in infrastructure
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.880]   the chips act i think is a very important bill which by the way has national security implications
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:13.160]   as you guys know the inflation reduction act a bizarre name for a bill that's really a energy and
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.720]   climate bill
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:19.560]   i think is is pretty good legislation and i think he reconstituted our allies around the world that
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.480]   had been frayed to a point of great danger during the trump administration so i salute the past but
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.200]   this is really an election about the future it's about a generational change it's about creating
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.800]   you know really a new american century that will be powered by
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.000]   systems structures people technologies that i'm just afraid that president biden
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.640]   and former president trump can't even comprehend let alone create thoughtful policies
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.920]   that will be able to create thoughtful policies to both nurture and also manage and i think that's
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.840]   where we're at and i want to i think we have wars overseas that i think in no small part are caused
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:19:00.040]   by a generation that is so focused on techniques and tools of the past that they can't even dare
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   look to building peace for the future that's i think why we have the middle east still going
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.920]   that's why ukraine you know the vice president has some ownership in some of these issues that
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.560]   i'm afraid um have to be exposed and they're the truth and i'm happy to talk about them but most of
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.320]   all i'll wrap it with this affordability in the united states of america is absolutely
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.200]   the most challenging issue facing americans they don't believe that their government is listening
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.840]   they don't believe the president understands they don't believe congress is able to do anything
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.160]   about it because we're so dysfunctional and that's another mission that i'm on right now
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.080]   to end this nonsense i am going to build a team of rivals i will have a white house
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:43.480]   and a cabinet comprised of both democrats and republicans the most able leaders imaginable who
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.800]   have run multi-billion dollar organizations in some cases understand customer service
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.520]   will employ zero-based budgeting to the extent we can we will employ a world-class consulting
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:20:00.120]   firm to look at every single government program system structure and and personnel
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.920]   to identify ways to save money these are things that this president and frankly no president
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.080]   who doesn't have business experience non-profit leadership experience and
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.400]   government experience could possibly imagine because they're so stuck in their silos
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.680]   ways of thinking he's been there for 50 years and it's time for change i was two three years old
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:24.360]   when he became a senator so let's get specific on the issues and go into foreign policy which
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.960]   is david saxe's i think number one issue this election but first just to be clear on biden
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.720]   do you believe he's in cognitive decline do the democrats privately believe he's in cognitive
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.320]   decline and to what extent do you think he'd make it through the next presidency
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   or do you think this is sort of a ronald reagan situation where he might look back on it and he's got
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.560]   some early onset of some cognitive decline what do you personally think and what do democrats think
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:55.240]   i don't want to impress upon anybody or give you the sense that i think he has a form of dementia
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:02.760]   or alzheimer's or significant cognitive decline but anybody who pays attention can see the change
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.480]   and i'm not i'm not you know people are saying that i'm causing his problems i could risk his
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.240]   you know re-election you know i'm not the guy that has him losing to trump nationally down in 5 of 6
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.840]   battleground states the lowest approval ratings in presidential history almost and i'm certainly
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.720]   not the guy that has shown his you know his decline that's on video that's on audio you see
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.360]   it it's natural he's a human being for goodness sakes all i'm doing you guys is saying the quiet
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   part out loud the only one you ask the question do others talk about this the question is is anybody
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.520]   not talking about this of course they are you guys they've really created an opportunity for you
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.320]   because like you said everyone's talking about this of course but no one's willing to say it
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.600]   of course what has been the blowback in the democratic party from your declaring what do
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.240]   you think i'm not being thrown flowers and parties let me tell you that guys i'll tell you i i i i
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.200]   think most would consider me an affable friendly well-liked member of congress i know that that's
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.560]   my that's my ethos my friends are still my friends i think they're disappointed because
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.440]   this is not what you do when you're a member of a party you follow the rules you follow the rules
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.680]   in line you shush up you sit down you get in line and you do nothing to upset the apple cart
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.760]   of others who've been waiting in line perhaps a little longer than you so you can imagine
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.880]   the pushback has been strong the arrow is sharp and the pain quite significant but nothing compared
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.160]   to the pain that americans are feeling right now and that's why i'm doing this and i should also
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.600]   let you know i had no intention of doing this a year ago i was on a radio show and a host asked
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.360]   me if i thought the president should run again and i said of course not he is not running again i'm
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.400]   implicitly if not explicitly said he would be a transitional president kind of the bridge most
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.760]   members of congress thought he was going to stand down that's why that's why newsom and pritzker and
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:59.720]   whitmer and so many others were kind of making their plans and i said and if he doesn't pass the
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.960]   torch then we should ensure that least that the stage has newer generation candidates to give
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.720]   voters a choice anyway months went by i started seeing the polls change dramatically the tenor and
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.800]   tone of constituent discussions with me and every single one of my colleagues was changing
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.360]   graphically all the independents moderate republicans that voted for the president i
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.200]   think for the right reasons were increasingly telling us that they're not going to do it again
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.560]   they may not vote for trump but they're not going to vote rather than vote for biden and over time
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.920]   it got to a point actually guys where i resigned from the house leadership table
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.840]   because my position was so incongruent with those who were in positions to do something about it
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.280]   that i didn't feel it was appropriate for me to sit with them anymore and i was really frustrated
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.480]   i called gretchen whitmer i called jb pritzker i made public calls to the candidates whose names
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.720]   are better known than me to jump in you know the water's warm you guys it's a democratic
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.680]   primary that's what we do not only did those two not take my calls which they would have any other
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:07.080]   day they had their political operatives take those calls and they told me please don't use their names
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.360]   that's the culture that's the culture you guys that we're dealing with you will be blackballed
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:20.040]   you will be disenfranchised you will be let out the door if you so much as even issue a word that
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.880]   you might challenge a sitting president of the united states this is the united states of america
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:30.920]   it's appalling anyhow i'm frustrated we saw that happen with rfk jr because he declared initially
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   as a democrat and biden wouldn't give him secret service protection despite the you know enormous
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.400]   personal safety risks and threats he's actually saying the same thing for me by the way guys you
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:48.680]   can imagine yeah and biggest line item in my budget right now by the way is security the biggest line
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   item the second biggest line item that's going to surpass that is getting onto the ballot right well
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.040]   that was the thing is they wouldn't let they wouldn't let rfk on the ballot they wouldn't debate
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.400]   him they just want to pretend like he didn't exist and they basically drove him out of the party so
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.480]   now he's running as an independent do you think you're gonna be able to get on the ballot as a
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.080]   democrat on in these primaries
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.880]   absolutely and we're making those choices right now david because first of all it's obscene i want
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:17.800]   to let you all know that in a country that prides itself on being a democracy a democratic republic
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.160]   i can't even tell you how many states literally create high barriers to entry to satisfy the two
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:31.800]   parties to ensure that their coronated candidate has an advantage over anybody else i'm talking
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.440]   about the most egregious ones give us an example of what you have to do oh the most egregious are
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   oftentimes the deepest blue new york is is close to impossible when i say impossible so explain it
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.840]   to us like what you have to do so the reason i started in new hampshire is it has a 103 year old
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   tradition of being the first in the nation primary they take this really seriously they're the most
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.560]   engaged americans in the country they have a process they you know we walk through the snow we
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.480]   answer their questions and you also all you need is a thousand dollar check you got to be 35 years
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.960]   old you got to be born in the united states of america and you're going to be a president of the
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.120]   united states of america and you too can become a candidate for president of the united states
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.520]   that's what i did they have the most beautiful ritual in the state house in concord new hampshire
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.640]   that is worth going to one time just to see the majesty of filing for president of the united
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.520]   states so there are 21 of us on the democratic side of the ballot because that's how it should be
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.800]   take take a state like virginia wait hold on there's 21 people running for the democratic
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:35.480]   but that's incredible i had no idea yeah 21 uh marianne williamson and i
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:42.600]   are the best known of those 21 because the president of the united states chose not to
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:50.520]   so that's how you have it you ask about other states though new york virginia uh 450 to 500 000
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:58.760]   to pay consulting firms to pay people 25 26 dollars per signature to just sit outside and
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:05.000]   just say hey can we get your signature to get this guy on a ballot no it's not grassroots it's not old school
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.680]   caucusing democracy it is pay to play and we would we would need it we would need a well we're going
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.800]   to have to raise uh probably six yeah maybe i'm sorry maybe maybe maybe less than that maybe five
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:22.600]   million dollars we have a staff of three people right now and legal counsel just to get my name
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.200]   on a primary ballot it's absurd marianne williamson you know she's not going to be able to
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:34.120]   rfk as a as an independent by the way i think he should be i i'm not someone who i'm concerned
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.240]   about some of his positions but i think he should be able to get on the ballot
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.120]   it's you guys it's absurd it's obnoxious and what i've discovered in the last three weeks
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.560]   is going to be my mission after being president to fix because it is going to destroy the country
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.040]   from the inside and that is why we have the kind of candidates we have year after year
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.720]   after year and americans say they're that's why we have trumpism i like the fact that
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.160]   you know most people become politicians as a career i've harped against this for a while
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.520]   and so they have everything to lose if they stand up against the party and they stand up against the
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.080]   political establishment within which they're meant to operate and therefore just a few people get to
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.520]   make all the decisions and control all the levers and everyone else is just a marionette but and
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.120]   they stay there forever dave they stay there forever and there's no term limits which is
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.840]   what we need that's why we need them the fact that you're self-made and you don't have anything to
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.120]   lose you can leave congress and you'll be fine you you're a citizen that can go back to work and
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.520]   do what you do and you're doing this as a service you're doing this because of your interest in the
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.800]   country it sounds like not to say that other folks don't but they're largely going to be driven and
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:47.000]   unfortunately adversely affected by the fact that they have to fall within the way that the game is
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.800]   played in order to operate and will not stand up and say the things that need to be said
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.880]   in order for us to make progress and get out of these situations but those are the perverse
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   incentives i commend you for doing it i'm glad it's possible i think jason we should probably
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.080]   talk about the topic we have two topics that i think we're all passionate here the first is
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.600]   foreign policy the second is the budget and our out of control spending let's start with sax
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.440]   you said you wanted hard questions welcome to the pot let's bring it before we came on you both said
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:24.120]   hard questions let's go please meet david sachs hey david dean you said a minute ago that one of
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.680]   the reasons why the world's on fire is because of the bind administration's handling of foreign
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.600]   policies kind of led us to this point i think there was a really good example of this a week
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   ago there was a new report out by a former u.n assistant secretary general named michael
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   von der schulenberg who worked at the u.n for 34 years he did a detailed study and reconstruction
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:51.480]   of what happened in march of 2022 so the month after the war and what he concluded is there was
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.120]   a bona fide deal on this and he said that the u.s government is not going to be able to do that
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.680]   because the u.s government is not going to be able to do that because the u.s government is not going to
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.160]   be able to do that because the u.s government is not going to be able to do that because the u.s government is not going
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:59.560]   deal on the table between Russia and Ukraine where Putin was willing to pull back and leave
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:06.680]   and leave the territorial integrity of Ukraine intact if Ukraine would agree not to become part
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.840]   of NATO and this is something that's been discussed um there's been many reports of this
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.480]   over the last several months Ukrainian Pravda had a story about that but now there's yet
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:21.320]   another confirmation that such a deal was available and yet Boris Johnson and Joe Biden
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:28.840]   said no we want to pressure Putin not work out a peace deal with him and so thanks to western
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:35.080]   intervention that deal never happened now we're 20 months later and the Ukrainian counter-offensive
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:41.320]   has failed it's been a fiasco the casualties have been absolutely massive horrifying you saw there
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.680]   was this article on time magazine this new profile of Zelensky where his own aides and advisors say
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.240]   that he's delusional he can't accept that they're losing the war they furthermore
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.800]   say that even if the U.S. provides more weapons more aid they don't have enough men they have
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.200]   enough soldiers to use them things are going that badly I think there's now a fear that Ukraine
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.120]   could collapse in the next year even if we provide more aid so I guess you know I know that early on
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.160]   in the war you supported Biden's policy I'm wondering have events on the ground now change
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.040]   your view at all how do you feel about it today do you think it was a mistake not to try and work
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.160]   out a peace deal in those early months of the war and if you were president what would you try
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.600]   and do differently now to try and end this thing well first of all I think we have to back up to
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:33.240]   2014 to talk about this David um you know first of all I I've seen that reporting I I do not have
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:38.680]   confirmation of the validity of that uh and and and if I did I could talk about it more directly
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:45.560]   but if that's the truth uh I would first ask did that include Crimea and secondly it is not this
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.680]   it's not a United States decision about whether or not Ukraine should agree to a peace deal it is uh
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.920]   a strange decision plain and simple but I I do want to turn back the clock a little bit because
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.840]   I think this all kind of plays together but by the way it didn't it didn't include Crimea but
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:04.040]   Zelensky was willing to go for that deal and it was the west who intervened and said no we want
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.360]   you to pressure Putin and fight David like I said you know I I never speak unless I can verify that
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:14.840]   myself and I've not seen that intelligence in the skiff I've not seen that presented to me if and by
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.280]   the way there are some times where I don't know most times none of us know everything if that is
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.000]   the case I would absolutely support it and I think that's a good point I think that's a good point
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.640]   absolutely answer this question differently but based on what I do know uh I want to turn back
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:31.480]   the clock to 2014. you know this is where foreign policy matters you know President Obama was a
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.920]   great orator I think a inspirational leader you know he came to the U.S. presidency with only
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:43.320]   organizing state legislative and a couple or few years of senate experience as a very young man
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:50.920]   and Joe Biden was his vice president and when Vladimir Putin took Crimea uh easily you know
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   that set the tone for what's going on right now and we have not done a very good job of prevention
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.320]   that's true in health care that is true in poverty that is true in our foreign policy
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.680]   which is by the way maybe what happens when you spend 83 billion a year on
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:14.120]   diplomacy and 850 billion a year on bombs and missiles not to mention go back to Eisenhower in
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   the military industrial complex David now you well know this it does it controls a lot of our policy
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:20.840]   because it's a very good job of preventing the spread of the virus and it's a very good job of
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:20.920]   preventing the spread of the virus and it's a very good job of preventing the spread of the virus
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:26.840]   because those who are making great profit find ways to influence those who open the piggy banks
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.680]   I think the Crimea moment in 2014 the writing was on the wall that was Putin's test if I take an
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.400]   inch well maybe they'll give me a mile and what happened during the Biden presidency of course he
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.760]   took the mile I think it has implications now though David and all of you you know if we do not
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.280]   do our best to support Ukraine and defending I think it doesn't just send a message to Putin
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.760]   a post-Putin Russia which is going to be a failure
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.840]   of the world and the world is going to be a failed nation with a brain drain and something we should
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:00.040]   talk about but also sends a message to Iran North Korea and even China when I want to talk about
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.760]   that too because I think we have a much brighter future with them than most people portray as it
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:10.520]   relates to Taiwan and that's the sad truth as we get ourselves into these situations that then layer
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.880]   up the consequences by withdrawing and Afghanistan was another example of that so to answer your
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.680]   question had there been a peace deal at that point that simply would have and the deal would have been
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:26.280]   back in return for not uh entering nato who in their right mind would say that was a bad deal
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:33.240]   who in their right mind especially boris johnson well well by the way it's a lot earlier when you
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.040]   get people like well i'm going to make this case as you guys know for comprehensive new generation
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.440]   of leaders all around the world in our country and in others that are sick of this nonsense
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.520]   sick of the bloodshed sick of enriching enterprise at the expense of human beings
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.440]   it happens here it happens in ukraine and russia and it's happening in the middle east
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   plain and simple.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.680]   Sachs, anything else on foreign policy you want to go to?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:00.580]   Packing off now would be, I think, a shameful, horrible mistake.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.360]   The one thing I would argue right now, David, is those who are most likely going to be subject
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.480]   to Putin's terror, the countries in Europe, should be carrying a much bigger part of this
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:11.740]   load.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:17.060]   We have 750 bases and installations around the world.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.400]   In 80 countries, we are the most dominant presence in world history of any government.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.820]   And we spend more on our military than the next, I think, 11 nations combined, for gosh
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.060]   sakes.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.160]   And if anyone thinks that a kinetic risk to the United States is the most likely harm
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.920]   that will be done us, not cyber or not social or not biological, I think you're out of your
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.240]   mind.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.800]   Those are the risks that I think are most threatening, that I think this president does
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.820]   not quite understand.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.040]   And we have to recomprise and recommit.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take.

[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   I'll make this really simple.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:05.040]   If we want to change our constitution and change what we consider speech,
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.040]   change how the federal government or any domestic government
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   affects people's rights to what they watch, what they read, what they eat,
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   how they pray, how they think, where they go, with whom they congregate,
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.040]   you know what, that's up to Americans.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   But I think to target one app is a huge mistake.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   And I have a very simple solution.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   Hold every single platform to the same standard,
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   transparency via their algorithm,
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   have an independent commission perhaps that is charged and responsible with assessing
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   and holding those platforms to account.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.040]   And if any of them violate the terms that we pass into law,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   then they should be banned.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   But to target one, I think it's nonsensical.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.040]   Well, we do have foreign ownership rules for media outlets.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   Sure. Well, yeah, we do.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   So this has many more users and is much more powerful with the algorithm.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   So then how would you respond to that sort of thing?
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040]   I'm just going to say this.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   If we want to change our Constitution,
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   this is what the Supreme Court, I'm afraid, is going to say if we start doing this,
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   then change the Constitution.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   That's what they said, by the way, about women's reproductive rights.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   You know, in the absence of Congress doing anything,
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   in the absence of that,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   we're going to assess it the way it reads.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   Right now, I don't think that's necessarily really possible without a significant Supreme Court challenge.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   My belief is yes.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.040]   Is it a threat? Yes, it's a threat.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.040]   By the way, every social media platform is a threat.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   When used by my colleagues,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   they're malign actors.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   Do you think we should force reciprocity?
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   If we allow TikTok, they allow Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and China?
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   I think that's the kind of thinking Jason and I like.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   In fact, reciprocity as it relates to IP, enforcement of IP,
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   of theft, of trade,
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.040]   you just hit the nail on the head.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.040]   Reciprocity.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   Let's be reciprocal in the nature of our relationship.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.040]   If you're going to ban our apps and our platforms,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   or our products, or our brands,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.040]   well, why?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.040]   This is to me an opportunity for the next generation
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.040]   to say this is nonsensical.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   If you're going to succeed...
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   By the way, China, you all know,
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   they have a bubble they're facing
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   that will make ours in 2008
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   look like a gumball
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   by comparison.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.040]   That is coming down the pipe.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.040]   I think that has a lot to do with this
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.040]   step towards rapprochement.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   But yes, reciprocity.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   To know that Facebook is not allowed.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   Yeah, perfect example.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   I think that's a great point.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   I think that's a great point.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   I think that's a great point.
