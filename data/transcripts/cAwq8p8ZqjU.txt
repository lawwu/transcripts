[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Today we have a simple and a straightforward question, and it comes
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   into us from a listener who writes this. Pastor John, how can I understand
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.720]   revival according to the Bible, and what would we expect to see if it broke out
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.600]   again today? What would you say, Pastor John? The idea of revival originates in
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.400]   the reality that on the one hand, God is the decisive giver of all spiritual life,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.520]   and on the other hand, humans, even those who are born again and part of God's
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.760]   covenant family, from time to time drift into a kind of lifelessness and lethargy
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.160]   and backsliding and indifference and weakness. And when you put those two
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.480]   together, God as the giver of life and man as ever drifting towards lifelessness,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.760]   what you get is the need for the hope of reviving, coming back to life, a fresh
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.320]   outpouring of God's life-giving Spirit on his people. That's what revival is. So
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:26.080]   for example, we read in Psalm 85 verse 6, "Will not you revive us again, O God, that
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.840]   your people may rejoice in you?" Or Habakkuk chapter 3 verse 2, "O Lord, I
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.440]   have heard the report of you and your work, O Lord, do I fear. In the midst of
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.520]   the years, revive it. In the midst of the years, make it known. In wrath, remember
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.400]   mercy." Or Psalm 80 verse 18, "Give us life that we may call upon your name." Or
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.720]   Isaiah 57 15, "Thus says the one who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.800]   whose name is holy, I dwell in a high and holy place and also with him who is of a
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   contrite and lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly, to revive the heart
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.720]   of the contrite." And alongside those passages about reviving, you read the
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.760]   history of Israel, and it's just one up and down after the other. One king is
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.560]   wicked, and God withholds his blessing or sends judgment. Another king recovers
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.000]   godliness, and there's a reviving and an awakening of true worship for a season,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.520]   and up and down it goes. And when you turn to the New Testament, even though
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   the period of time is really short between Jesus' resurrection and the close
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.520]   of the New Testament, maybe 40 years or so, we do get glimpses already of
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.320]   churches that were in need of reviving. I think the book of Hebrews was written
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.640]   to a church like that. You hear it in Hebrews 5 12, "Though by this time you
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.040]   ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles and
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.840]   oracles of God," or chapter 12 verse 12, "Lift your drooping hands and strengthen
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.280]   your weak knees and make straight the paths of your feet, so that what is lame
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.760]   may not be put out of joint." So this is a church that's already drooping, it's
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.080]   already dragging, it's gotten tired already and needs reviving. And then when
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.220]   you read the prayers of Paul, this is where I feel it, when you read the
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.800]   prayers of Paul and his letters, they read just like prayers that would be
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   made for churches that are drifting into lifelessness. There are few prayers in
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.440]   the Bible that have had a reviving, challenging, awakening, renewing effect on
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.320]   me like Ephesians 3 14 to 19, where Paul prays like this, "I pray that according to
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:19.280]   the riches of your glory, you may grant us to be strengthened with power through
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.840]   your spirit in the inner being, so that Christ might dwell in our hearts
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.880]   through faith, that we being rooted and grounded in love may have strength to
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   comprehend with all the saints what is the height and depth and length and
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.480]   breadth, and to know the love of Christ that passes knowledge and be filled with
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.680]   all the fullness of God." I mean, over the years in my pastoral ministry, that
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.960]   prayer to have power to comprehend the height and depth and length and breadth
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.920]   and to be filled with all the fullness of God was a heart cry because of how
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:04.440]   short I knew I fell of being filled with all the fullness of God. In the history
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.920]   of the church, the term "revival" in its most biblical sense has meant a sovereign
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.640]   work of God in which the whole region, a whole region of many churches, many
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.920]   Christians has been lifted out of spiritual indifference and worldliness
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.840]   into conviction of sin, earnest desires for the world of Christ and his Word, boldness
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.240]   in witness, purity of life, lots of conversions, joyful worship, renewed
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.960]   commitment to missions. You feel God has moved here, and basically revival then
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.480]   is God doing among many Christians at the same time or in the same region
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   usually what he's doing all the time in individual Christians' lives as people
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   get saved and individually renewed around the world. And I'll just say if
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.240]   anybody wants to go further, Martin Lloyd-Jones' book called "Revival" would be
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.560]   a great read. Or you can go to Desiring God and just type, like I did earlier

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.320]   going to talk about why the Bible sometimes cites non-biblical sources. In
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.880]   this case, we're going to talk about citations in the book of Jude and how
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.560]   they got there. I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the podcast, and
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.120]   we hope you have a wonderful weekend. We'll see you back here on Monday.
