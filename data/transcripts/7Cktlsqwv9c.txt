[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   In the last Ask Pastor John podcast episode, episode 216, you focused on the doctrinal
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.060]   and emotional abuses in the charismatic movement, but you said there's other abuses to address.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.680]   What are some other abuses that caused you concern, Pastor John?
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:29.200]   What I said was, lest we be harder on charismatics than on non-charismatics, we must keep in
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   mind that all the abuses I'm mentioning, these have their counterparts, their mirror image
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.160]   in the non-charismatic churches as well.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.360]   So in the previous podcast, we focused on doctrinal abuses and emotional abuses, and
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.240]   I would say that non-charismatics taken as a whole, all the Christians who don't practice
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.700]   the gifts, are far more guilty of these than charismatics.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.280]   Think of all the doctrinal errors in the history of the church.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.380]   Those weren't charismatics by and large.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.920]   Think of all the dying mainline churches today with all their moral and doctrinal aberrations.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.000]   These aren't charismatics.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.880]   And think of the emotional deadness in thousands of non-charismatic evangelical mainline churches.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880]   Those are deadly emotional abuses.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.240]   And we just need to remember that if we target the charismatic church because of things that
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   are happening there, doctrinally and emotionally, let's remember the mirror image, which are
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.860]   equally deadly, are happening among non-charismatic churches as well.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.440]   So here, let me mention two more abuses.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.760]   There was doctrinal, then there was emotional.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.160]   Now I'd add discernment abuses or lack of discernment abuses.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:54.560]   And by this, I mean doctrinally sound people who are not denying any fundamental doctrine
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.000]   and who are not loose cannons emotionally.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   They're just undiscerning and make mistakes that bring reproach on the spiritual gifts.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.240]   And this I have in mind, 1 Thessalonians 5, "Do not quench the spirit, do not despise
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.040]   prophecies, test everything, hold fast to what is good."
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.520]   Now, why would Paul say, "Don't despise"?
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.100]   That's very strong language.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.560]   And I think it's because some of those folks were claiming to speak for God, and it resulted
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   in foolishness.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.240]   They weren't speaking for God.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.320]   And it resulted in an emotional pushback in the church.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.360]   They said, "We don't want that."
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.640]   And Paul was trying to rescue prophecy from broad brush sweeping it away entirely by saying,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.560]   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.480]   Discern what is good here and discern what is bad here.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   Don't throw it all away.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.720]   Make distinctions in the various claims to hold it fast."
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.280]   So let me give a couple of illustrations from my life, or maybe just one.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.120]   I have been prophesied over numerous times, and two of them were just wacko.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.960]   I mean, it was so hard in those days to try to take this seriously.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.560]   I really resonated with the folks who were starting to despise prophecies.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.840]   A lawyer one time prophesied over me when my wife was pregnant.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.560]   He said, "Your fourth child is going to be a girl, and your wife is going to die in childbirth."
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   And that lawyer, with tears, told me that she was sorry she had to tell me that.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.520]   So I went home, and I got down on my knees and I said, "Lord, I'm trying to do what you
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.200]   said here in 1 Thessalonians."
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.040]   And frankly, I despise what that woman just said.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.840]   It proved out that my fourth child was a son, and I knew as soon as he came out that that
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.000]   prophecy was not true, and so I stopped having any misgiving about my wife's life.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   She's still with me now, 30 years later.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.920]   So that's the sort of thing that makes you despise prophecy.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.200]   And then I was at another meeting where a well-known prophet, if I said the name, lots
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.320]   of people would know who it was.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.680]   He prophesied over me, and I could tell as he was talking, he's just trying to fit in
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.760]   with the trajectory of my life and say some nice things about me.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.840]   And what he said simply didn't come true that year.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.440]   He said it was going to come true by the end of the year.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   It didn't.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.880]   So I know the lack of discernment that people can have, even when they're solid, doctrinal
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.200]   people.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.680]   So that's a third one, discernment issues that make us want to despise the gift of prophecy.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.920]   And here's the last one I would call financial abuses.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.160]   So doctrinal, emotional, discernment issues, and now financial abuses.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.280]   People who treat their giftedness, whether in teaching or healing or prophecy or evangelism,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.720]   as a warrant to make their ministry a means of getting rich.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.240]   And of course, you can hear even in that list of gifts I gave, evangelism and teaching,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.040]   that I'm not thinking merely about charismatics here.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.840]   We tend to think of charismatics when we think of people abusing finances in this way.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.820]   Well, all you have to do is listen to the Twitter sphere to know that's not the case.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:42.160]   There are just as many non-charismatic leaders who are using their status as an effective
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.000]   spiritual leader to make a lot of money and accumulate a lot of money and look like they
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.560]   have a lot of money.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.640]   And I want to say that there are a lot of simple, honest, humble, charismatic pastors
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:00.040]   living on modest salaries who are less guilty than many non-charismatics when it comes to
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.200]   financial abuses.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.920]   And of course, there are plenty of non-charismatic pastors using their status to get rich and
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120]   have lavish lifestyles.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:17.360]   Now, here's the key text, 1 Timothy 6, and as it comes to the end of verse 5, it talks
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.560]   about false teachers who imagine—this is the end of verse 5—who imagine that godliness
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.760]   is a means of gain.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.040]   So it's possible to have a teaching gift or a healing gift, some kind of remarkable gift
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.720]   that is so popular, you make millions of dollars.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   And then you start feeling entitled to it all—lavish clothes, lavish cars, lavish
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.880]   houses, lavish jets and hotel accommodations—turning godliness into a means of gain and justifying
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   it by the fact that you are so gifted and so many people are benefiting from what you
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.080]   say.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.760]   To whom, charismatic or non-charismatic, Paul would say in verse 9 of 1 Corinthians 6, "Those
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.360]   who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.720]   desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction."
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:19.160]   So wanting that better car, wanting those fancier clothes, wanting that bigger house,
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.560]   wanting that longer vacation, wanting that top floor hotel room that has the pool in
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.160]   it as well as the bathtub, wanting that stuff will kill you, Paul said.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.720]   So my alternative is to preach Christian hedonism that says, "Pursue contentment in God, not
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   in things."
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.040]   Or let's let Paul say it, "Godliness with contentment is great gain.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   For we brought nothing into the world, we cannot take anything out of the world.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.320]   If we have food and clothing with these, we will be content."
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.360]   So one summary word to end.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.800]   Charismatic doctrinal abuses, emotional abuses, discernment abuses, financial abuses all have
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.240]   their mirror image in non-charismatic churches.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.920]   We all stand under the Word of God and we all need repentance.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.680]   Yes, so true.
