[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Is the genius of Kurt Gerdl like the genius of a lot of great thinkers who have made a big impact throughout history?
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.520]   required structure and
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.800]   Intentional thinking about how do I approach my life?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:24.960]   I'm Cal Newport and this is deep questions the show about living and working deeply in a distracted world
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.760]   So I'm up here in the deep work HQ North in Hanover, New Hampshire
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.040]   joined in the
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.080]   deep work HQ South by my producer
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.880]   Jesse
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.500]   Jesse how's it going down there? What is the weather I am missing in Washington DC right now?
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.680]   Yesterday it was 90 degrees and with high high humidity
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   Well, I'm not gonna say I missed that too much. I think the high tomorrow is 78
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.280]   We did have some humidity up here with this unstable system of rain, but that's past and I forgot what low humidity
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.360]   New England summer is like spoiler alert. It is very good. So I thought I would just check in briefly
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   Okay, what have I learned so far?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.340]   Living up here in New England in this very scenic college town of Hanover where Dartmouth College is living right off
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.320]   Campus on Ockham pond and this cool house. They put us up in where I am right now looking
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.920]   Past the camera and out a large arched window
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.760]   onto a pond with with
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.720]   Pine trees beyond it. So the question is this is a question I had coming into this experience
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.160]   How much is location going to make a difference?
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240]   Will I really feel when in the day, you know, the actual work is work
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.400]   Writing is on the same computer screen as it is in DC
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.980]   I'm in a classroom just like I would be you know in DC
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.160]   I'm in an office sometimes just like would be in DC does the location around where the work happening being different?
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.680]   Am I finding that that actually makes a difference and I think my report is yes, I
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.720]   Think it has made a notable difference. There's a few attributes. I was taking notes on this earlier today
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.600]   There's a few attributes about this new location that I think has been
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.520]   demonstrably impactful on the mindset when it comes to me doing work, I think a the
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.220]   The calmness and by calmness. I just mean lack of people
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.160]   DC is a big city. There's a lot of people in DC if you go anywhere
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.320]   There's going to be a lot of people you're driving through if the place is worth going to the parking lot is going to
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.840]   Be full if you have to get on the beltway, it doesn't matter if it's 3 a.m. On Christmas for some reason
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.600]   There's a lot of people
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.960]   Driving on that road, which is fine because you do appreciate that energy, but I am noticing this escape from that actually is
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.520]   Having an impact on my mood. So there's a certain
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.600]   Calmness I'm noticing that the mind has when it's not constantly seeing other people around or constantly feeling crowded
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   And there's a lot more nature up here and this too seems to be having a positive
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.920]   impact on my professional mindset this house where they put us up in here on the pond is
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.760]   Right down the road from what used to be the golf course, which they they closed down
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.920]   So that's now a park surrounded by woods and you can walk or trail run through these woods
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.480]   It's two minutes down the road. So every day you can be in the woods or walking across
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.600]   Rolling fields, you know how it goes Jesse when these golf courses they stop keeping them
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.800]   Like a golf course really tightly mowed they begin to look like st. Andrews
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.540]   they begin to look like those old Scottish style courses with the
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.820]   Yeah, a lot of cool fescue a lot of cool fescue is exactly
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.680]   I hear that word so often as I'm walking around people just saying like look at this fescue this very Scottish
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.840]   Very Scottish fescue. So it's what a well fescue park. Anyways, that seems to also be having a
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.040]   calming and focusing mindset as well, so I think it's a successful this part of my experiment of
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.600]   Bringing the family up to New England seeing what it's like to be there for an extended period of time during the summer
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.460]   I would say so far that experiment is successful if I was to try to now
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.440]   Imagine my ideal summer setup. So take the best of what I'm seeing here and combine it with other things. I'm missing I
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.640]   think probably what I would do in a world where just
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.000]   Money was accessible and not a problem and anything is possible
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.720]   I think probably what I would do from just what would be the best working environment status would be probably have a house
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.600]   I like this general latitude is fine
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.000]   Probably a little bit more remote. I think the house itself being remote could be a really interesting final twist
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I really love the town here
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.360]   But I live in a really cool small town already
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.600]   So it's not that different
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.800]   So I already can just walk into a really cool small town and know the people at the coffee shop and and so I love that
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.520]   But I don't necessarily need to simulate that if I'm away for the summer
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.160]   So I was thinking if I was really creating my ideal summer situation this type of region
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   But maybe up in the hills or the mountains a little bit more a property that was just big enough
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.800]   You could have a trail so you have a trail you could walk on with your coffee just to get the thinking going but not
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.880]   Being too far from civilization one month the six weeks starting in July put those together. I think it would be an ideal
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.480]   deep work
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.960]   Accelerator, so if you have a really cool property that you've been thinking I would really like to just get rid of this really cheap
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.880]   I
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.000]   Don't like money
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.400]   So I just wanted to sell this much cheaper than it's worth and it's up here and it's in the hills and it has its
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.660]   Own trail on it or something. Let me know because I do think
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.800]   There's a reason why so many writers who have this type of flexibility in their schedule do retreat to other locations in the summer
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.080]   It's a nice reset. It's been a nice cognitive reset. So I would say
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.520]   Jesse so far so good when we build our compound up here, though. We're gonna have a high-end podcasting studio
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.880]   Because that's how good that's the one that's the one thing I miss is I don't have my high-end podcasting studio
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.920]   Actually, it's two things I miss. There's not a high high
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   capacity podcasting studio and to
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   the nearest IMAX size movie screen is
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.320]   A hour and a half away from here. Oh
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.280]   Really and we have Oppenheimer comes out today Chris Nolan. I want to see that
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.180]   Barbie came out today, but I'm thinking a particular Oppenheimer, you know, he filmed that thing on a combination of 65 and 70 millimeter
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.220]   I'm probably end up seeing this at the Nugget Theatre, which is fine. I remember it fondly. It's down I can walk to it
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.720]   I remember going there fondly as a college student, but let's just say the screens of the Nugget Theatre are not exactly
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:43.120]   Like the AFI theater where they'll actually have a 70 millimeter projector, you know near my house in Silver Spring
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.780]   So that's the one issue you do not come up here to be a cinephile not a lot of good
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.360]   Movie opportunities nearby, but I think we could put up with that
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.160]   We could put up with one of the requests is I think you should put a putting green in the backyard of the podcasting studio
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.360]   With this request this request is coming from a Jay Miller. Just anonymously
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.480]   Jay Miller, you know work on my golf. You know work on my three-footers
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.840]   Yeah, a little chip little chip and putt the backyard of the studio. Yeah, that's the key
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   What I learned is that means though by the way the studio
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.860]   This property would have to be in Vermont because Vermont has way more fiber
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.420]   High-speed fiber than New Hampshire, New Hampshire is way behind Vermont on high-speed Internet
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.380]   So I'm enjoying being in Hampshire now, no offense, New Hampshire rights, but just for the sake of our
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.700]   podcast studio slash putting green
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.920]   Slash deep work north. We're gonna have to probably do that in Vermont
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.700]   So anyways, I want to talk a little bit about the today's show
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.900]   So so for the deep dive
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.860]   I'm gonna go into something that a
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.180]   Listener sent me that I thought was so cool that I thought we have to discuss this on the show
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.180]   So we'll get into that in a second
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.620]   We'll do some questions after that that are vaguely related just as a spoiler alert for later in the show
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.460]   I have heard your request and I will
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.060]   check in later in the show on
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.820]   My remarkable to tablet and I will give you an update on how things are going
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.860]   With my remarkable to what my review is so far. So we have all that going in the show
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.620]   So let's let's start with the deep dive. What I want to do is actually highlight
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.340]   Some scans that were sent to me from a lister named Alexander from Serbia
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.260]   And these scans came from a book that I am going to actually I'm gonna bring on the screen for those who are watching
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.940]   at youtube.com slash Cal Newport media, this is episode
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.480]   258 so if you're watching you can look there go to the deep life comm and look for episode
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:49.780]   258 I'm gonna bring up on the screen for those who are watching a book that these scans I want to discuss are from
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.940]   All right, so this book is I'll read in the English is the philosophical notebooks of
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.420]   the famous logician and mathematician Kurt Gerdl
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.660]   so this was translated into English by
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.700]   Merlin Carl so you can it's his girdles notebooks his personal notebooks
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.140]   They've been translated
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.280]   Multi-volume and you can actually go through and see the type of things that Kurt Gerdl was writing
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.260]   This listener Alexander sent me some really interesting pages
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:29.280]   excerpted from these notebooks that all focus on we can think of as the
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.220]   Deep life time management life management
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.600]   These the thoughts girdle was having about how to structure his life make best use of his time push his life
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:47.180]   Push his life in the right direction. So that's really cool to see a true genius. We have a snapshot on how he was thinking about
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.540]   Structuring his life to make it as deep as effective as possible. Now if you don't know who Kurt girdle is
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.460]   What you need to know is he's a 20th century
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.740]   logician and
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:04.940]   Mathematician did a lot of his work when he was young in the this would been like the 1930s died in the 1970s
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.360]   He's probably best known for his incompleteness theorems
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.620]   These were considered very important
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.500]   I had John von Neumann called this at some point like one of the most important things that was ever done in logic
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.420]   He's been compared to
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:25.900]   Aristotle in terms of other comparable figures in terms of their impact on the study of logic and the incompleteness theorems
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.460]   are are beautiful and
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.580]   Mathematically insightful and basically what they show and I won't I won't get into too much nerdy detail here
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.220]   But basically what he proved was any sufficiently
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.020]   complicated system of logics of axioms and inferences is
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.900]   Going to have statements
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.940]   That you can express that are true
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.220]   But cannot be proved true using that system
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:59.580]   So this was the notion of incompleteness theorems is that there was no this is a big deal because at the time
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.900]   Motivated by the challenge set forth by the German mathematician David Hilbert
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.180]   There is this idea that we can just create we can reduce all of mathematical
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.260]   knowledge everything is true or not true to a
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:19.060]   Finite system of axioms and inferences from which everything true can be generated and girdle came in and said no
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:26.260]   Every every sufficiently complicated system be it math or any type of logical system. It's going to be incomplete
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.020]   It can't fully describe everything about itself
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.060]   That's true, and he did it in a really cool way, and I don't want to get too much into the nerd weeds here
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.260]   I teach this sometimes in my graduate class, but but basically what he did was he
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.180]   he embedded
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.340]   He embedded whatever system you give him that sufficiently complex
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:50.620]   He showed how to embed certain logical statements into that system, and I'm really bastardizing this a little bit, but in essence
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.460]   he showed you give me a
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.460]   sufficiently complex system I can basically embed a statement that says something like
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:04.900]   This statement is false now. I'm not exactly that of course, but one of these sort of self a recursive self-referential
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.620]   statement that was
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:14.740]   Possible to prove one way or the other as it is a big simplification, but it was a really cool feat of logic and
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.780]   it showed this whole program of
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.500]   Unifying all logical truths with one system was never going to happen if you were into that at the time
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:29.100]   If you were Bertrand Russell in the 1920s or 30s this was like a bomb going off
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.740]   And then he came to the US. He was at the Institute for Advanced Studies. He had some issues later in life
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.940]   Interesting guy Turing met him he was there at the same time as Einstein and von Neumann so anyways this is all to say
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:45.100]   Kurt Gödel is a very smart guy and we have in his notebooks
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.480]   How he was thinking about structuring his life and work, so I'm gonna load up
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.380]   I'm gonna load up some of these pages, and I'll read them out loud and put them on the screen
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.760]   And we can react to them all right, so here's the
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.660]   The first page I want to load here from his notebook
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260]   Let's see
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.260]   No interesting one second here by the way people are watching
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.460]   Interesting okay if people are watching here, they're seeing
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:24.580]   Me try to learn how the screen sharing works, so I let me share a different screen here. This is fascinating audio
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.580]   I'm sure for everyone who's listening
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.980]   Let's see here there we go
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.880]   All right, so I want to start there we go. This is what I want to start with all right
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.560]   I'm learning how this works Jesse. This is not our normal setup some
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.600]   What people don't know is in our normal setup usually?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:47.060]   Jesse can manipulate what's on the screen or not using a switcher and and in our deep work HQ North. I'm doing this
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.900]   Manually okay, so here's what I have on the screen now
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:55.580]   This is a table of contents for the notebook from which we're we're pulling more of these notes
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.740]   So we get a sense of the type of things girdle cared about
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.460]   So the content of this notebook he labeled this notebook as you'll see on the screen time
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.500]   Management and then under time management here are these scales he has
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.340]   for each day separately
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.380]   for each week precisely
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.300]   Roughly for several months
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.500]   Now let's stop right there because what we immediately see and I didn't know this
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.820]   This is the first time this week that I've seen these notebooks from girdle
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.860]   He was exactly thinking about what we call multi-scale productivity on this podcast
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.260]   He was exactly thinking about okay
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.100]   You need to manage your time on the day on the week and on the several month or what we would call a semester or quarterly
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.920]   Scale so Kurt girdle back a hundred years ago was actually thinking this exact same way now
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.500]   He adds a little bit more if we look at this outline. He says also
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.060]   Time management should also be thought about for the next year
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.660]   The highest objectives to be reached so he has daily weekly monthly
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   Annually, and then his final
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.400]   Subsection for this notebook is labeled. What should I do? And how should I do it?
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.320]   That is how should I behave with regard to certain matters and situations parentheses maxims?
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.960]   So we can think of that as discipline. So this is the structure of the way
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.120]   He's thinking about managing himself in his time
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.060]   Multi-scale planning from day week the month to year which again is very congruent with what we talked about
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.780]   You know
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.060]   I talked about once a year at your birthday sort of working out your vision for the year and that he moves down the time
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.060]   Scales and then he has something like daily disciplines
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.740]   So that's what he has here
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.460]   That's what he has here
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:36.220]   Says contents, let's look at some of the actual content now. Let's look at once he looks at these questions
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.220]   What are some of the things he comes up with?
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.980]   So I'm going to load first
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:47.340]   I'm looking through a couple options here. These are out of order. So this is interesting
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.180]   All right, here we go
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.020]   All right, so here is a
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:16:01.900]   random page from this time management notebook and he says general principle better to plan less and
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.740]   Actually carry it out
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.500]   So don't try to schedule too much. It's better to have a realistic schedule
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.580]   He then sketches in words if you're looking this on the screen a particular time block plan
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.820]   I'm gonna skip from the time block plan that he is describing in words here
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.500]   I'm gonna skip to one that he actually drew a diagram from so let's see what one of these time block plans
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:32.580]   Actually looks like so I'll put this up on the screen here. We've seen he has blocked off various times. So before noon
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.060]   He has
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:41.540]   Continuum lectures Princeton comma Notre Dame. So this is nine to I see nine to one o'clock
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.540]   Working on these lectures for Princeton and Notre Dame one to two o'clock lunch
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.420]   two to three or four o'clock mail
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.140]   budget life plan
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.940]   four to five o'clock stroll and
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.860]   Then he has for Monday and Wednesdays two o'clock errands
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:06.300]   Below that he says in spare time theology read mathematical papers continue own work resume time management on a small scale
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.460]   So what we're seeing here, which is pretty cool. Is that girdles coming up with a time block?
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.500]   Template he's saying roughly this is what I should be doing. I think this was a plan for a particular week
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.300]   He's like most days
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:24.340]   I should be working in the morning on this until I get the lunch then do tasks in the afternoon have an evening stroll on
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:31.020]   Two days out of the week. There's instead I'll do errands starting at two o'clock and that might take longer
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.580]   So what I love about this is that this is so
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.780]   Contemporary. I mean, this is the way we talk about it that controlling your time
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.500]   Figuring out when do I want to do work looking at the whole plan?
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   Oh, I'm gonna do errands on these two days. Let me get my hard work done in the mornings
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.800]   What am I working on hard this week while I'm working on?
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.500]   These lectures in that particular case. No, see as general heuristics. Okay, what should I do if I have free time outside of this?
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.700]   well, here's the things for my attention should be
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.500]   shared so what we're seeing there is a
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:08.420]   Real intentionality and how he's thinking about his schedule, right? Here's another one. I wanted to show you here another notebook page
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:16.060]   So here okay, this is labeled program it says and he's instructing himself here. It's from 1937
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.900]   Draw up a preliminary program for next week
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:26.100]   Once or twice per week in particular how much time is to be spent on various disciplines?
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.020]   I'm gonna focus in on that one part there because here we have him
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.400]   Clearly talking about his weekly planning discipline
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.440]   Once or twice a week figure out your plan for the week
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.540]   So why is he saying twice a week because he's saying fix it so you make a plan for your week
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.660]   Maybe by Wednesday you're off your plan. So update that plan
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.860]   so we see here a real commitment to
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:53.740]   Weekly planning in addition to what we're seeing before with some more daily time block planning. I mean, this is stuff that
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.260]   Productivity nerds like us can really geek out on
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.940]   We get a couple more
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.400]   General things as well, which I find interesting some remarks and some plans about
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.920]   Directing his life more generally. So consider for example this page. I'm putting up there. He labels this remark and here's what he says
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:17.340]   The microstructure of my mental state is that I do not properly focus my attention on anything
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:23.040]   But rather already looked the next thing while dealing with another one of the reasons I am slow by nature
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.760]   But do not carry out my mental work with natural slowness
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.280]   Why?
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.260]   So here we have Kurt Gerdl certified genius
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.440]   Complaining about the same sort of things that most of us who have an intellectual job do I can't keep my focus. I
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.360]   Wander on to think about something else. I need to be working slowly
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.100]   But my mental work is jumping around too fast. My mind is quickly moving
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.540]   This is him writing in the 1930s
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.640]   So could you imagine if he had email and Twitter to actually look at as well?
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.360]   But I just think it's so interesting to see these great minds are struggling with the same issues
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.640]   And again, this is something we've talked about
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.960]   to focus intensely on something abstract
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.460]   Like logic or writing or strategy is not a natural behavior for the human brain
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.920]   It is something that we have to really deploy quite a bit of artifice
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.980]   To do successfully and here we're seeing this so take out of the equation even modern distractions
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.080]   There's great mind working at the peak of his powers is
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.740]   Struggling to corral his brain. How do I keep focused on the thing?
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.840]   I'm doing it. I need to work slowly this stuff is hard, but my brain wants to move ahead fastly
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.840]   It's always as he says here
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.040]   Looking ahead to the next thing while dealing with
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.840]   another
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.000]   So these issues are timeless and these issues around
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.760]   Distraction are not something that is just new to our era. All right. Here's another
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.680]   Cool general life insight he has
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.280]   He labels this Maxim
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   more haste less speed
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.460]   One should take one's time with everything
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:07.760]   Do everything at one's own pace if a decision is to be announced in a letter better to give a preliminary answer to be polite
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.920]   deciding and acting are
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.960]   two different things
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.200]   All right, so there's a couple interesting things going on here
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.680]   One is a seems to me a slow productivity commitment
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.620]   more haste less speed
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.960]   so
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.320]   don't
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.160]   Procrastinate this is what I'm reading this more haste don't procrastinate don't put things off
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:36.200]   But don't actually rush the thing you're doing so give things the time it requires one should take one's time with everything
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.560]   but
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.000]   Do the things that need to happen? Maybe this is how I'm reading this maximum
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.600]   I think it's a maximum that puts a lot into it now
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.440]   Now his second example here if a decision is to be announced in a letter
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   Better to give a preliminary answer deciding and acting are two very different things. So again what I interpret there. This is very practical
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.440]   We're getting very practical here. He's saying if there's something you need to do that's really
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.680]   complicated or time-consuming
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.840]   You want to take your time to do it? You want to give it the time it requires?
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.760]   So so maybe just answer someone say hey, I will do this. Don't worry
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.320]   I will do this so that they're you're being polite but take your time to actually do it
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.960]   More haste less speed. So you don't want to procrastinate
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:22.600]   You you don't want to put things off needlessly tell some if you're gonna do something commit to doing it
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.240]   But when it comes time to actually executing take the time it requires
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:32.360]   Slow and steady. So a lot being packed into some of these some of these maxims here. All right. Let's see. I think I have one more
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.480]   That I thought was interesting
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.600]   Alright another maxim
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.640]   Again, all from Kurt Gerdl's
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.800]   Notebooks. All right. Here's what he writes here
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.720]   to achieve certain abstract
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.000]   parentheses mental spiritual
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.920]   Things one needs to adhere to a certain purely external parentheses physical rules
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.320]   For example get up at a certain time
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.160]   Sit down at your desk to do work. Do not lie down
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.440]   Have a notebook and scratch paper and pencils in front of you come up with time management
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:08.720]   Every evening take along a note when going out and take it out and look at it after any errand spend a certain amount of
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.640]   Time on something even when and he goes on from there
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:18.440]   so what he's saying here, which again is a point we've stumbled across ourselves on this show more than once is
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.480]   disciplines
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:29.320]   To make practice on these sort of abstract goals have daily disciplines that you just do that move you towards those abstract goals
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:36.000]   Have the physical to support the mental and the spiritual don't just think about how I want to be a great thinker
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.040]   Have a discipline of when I get up when I go to my desk. What is on my desk?
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   All the materials is right there
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:48.280]   Have a plan make a plan for what exactly you're gonna do with your time each evening for the day that follows next
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.280]   So he has this very again
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:56.040]   Rich philosophically rich idea being packed into a small amount of text here
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:01.800]   The structured physical unlocks the less structured more impressive mental and spiritual
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.000]   The other thing I want to point out about this is the way that time management as a term. This is a very early a
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.960]   Very early occurrence of the term time management. This is very interesting. I mean I have in my personal library collections
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.080]   One of the earliest business books to actually talk about time management
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.720]   I have a first edition of it on a display case up in my library and
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.360]   It's from the 1950s and this has been written in the 1930s, but notice back then I don't know if this is just standard or
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:35.880]   Just the way he's using here, but notice time management is being used differently here
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:43.620]   So it's being used almost like a noun come up with time management every evening. So the term there is being used like a scheduler plan
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.720]   Come up with the time management like a time schedule
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:54.680]   Whereas it became a verb so by the 1950s time management is something you do I practice time management
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.440]   It could also become an adjective. I have a time management system, but it's interesting just to see this here as
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.380]   Now come up with the time management not practice time management, so anyways
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.100]   These are just some random excerpts that Alexander pulled out from those notebooks and
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.980]   the summarize what I'm taking away from this is
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:21.180]   The genius of Kurt Gerdl like the genius of a lot of great thinkers who have made a big impact throughout history
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.460]   required structure and
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.940]   Intentional thinking about how do I approach my life? How do I make use of my time?
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:36.380]   How do I make sure my activities are actually supporting what matters and he had a lot of ideas and a lot of those ideas
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:42.380]   Correspond with what we talked about on this show. He was a believer. It's clear here in multi-scale planning
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.220]   He planned his time on many different levels. He was a believer in
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:50.540]   Disciplines having these regular disciplines that you do automatically but help you make progress
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:56.960]   Over time on the bigger less more abstract things that are important in your life, but broader than any of those specifics or the particular
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.900]   Congruence behind between his ideas and what we talked about on the show is just the grappling with it
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.420]   we have all this energy that's being expended out into the
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.380]   Entropic universe and the key is how do we how do we aim that?
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.300]   How do we harness that and aim that and the people who end up really doing?
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:18.020]   interesting things with this potential tend to be people who do grapple quite a bit with
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.740]   How best do I make use of this energy and it's a complicated question?
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:27.500]   Gertl is a smart guy and he's wrangling with it and making notes to himself and expressing frustrations
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.860]   Coming up with plans probably changing these plans, you know
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.780]   It's easy to look at those type of activities and say why are you fiddling with all this productivity?
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.900]   You have such an optimization mindset or whatever it is
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:43.300]   whatever the critiques are but ultimately some degree of this wrangling is necessary if you actually want to
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.700]   Create value out of what's going on
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.840]   Between your ears to take thought matter and make it into something interesting
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.660]   So so for that, I think this was a great example that yeah
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.620]   Even the great thinkers we think about is just wandering and being brilliant and it just comes to them
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.180]   Automatically, they're wrangling with the same stuff. The rest of us are wrangling with
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:09.020]   So Alexander from Serbia. Thank you for passing along that particular notebook
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.100]   I'll probably have to buy a copy of those English translations of those notebooks
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.940]   That might be cool to have in the HQ or my library at home. But that was yeah a lot of fun to see that
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.920]   Was the time management every evening is that equivalent of your shutdown essentially I
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.820]   Might be an interesting way of thinking about it. Yeah sit down to make a plan for
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.700]   the next day
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.480]   Could be the his shutdown routine. There's some other I didn't put him in here
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.780]   there's some other time block plans in here where he talks about the evenings and he definitely had a
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.600]   System for his evenings like when he I mean his evenings were all spent
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.320]   You know, I should have made put one of those in a lot of his evening plans were focused on
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.680]   Adele
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.580]   This person named Adele who I'm assuming is his wife. I should probably go look that up
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:00.100]   So that's what he was talking about. He was talking about time management for what he does in the evening not the next day
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.280]   Well, no
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:01.400]   No
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.920]   I think what he was saying there was make a plan for the next day in the evening so that you can hit the ground
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.280]   Okay, but he does have elsewhere in the notebooks a lot of thought about spending time with his
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.040]   His wife and going for a walk and doing this and what time is gonna go to sleep?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   And so I think he did think a lot about
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.320]   That time outside. So it did I mean those those plans did seem to have an implicit transition
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.640]   If you look in the notebook of you know
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.680]   My work is done by 5 and then I'm really thinking about what I want to do with my time and my family else after
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.080]   Work is over. So he clearly gave that gave that a lot of thought as well
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:38.560]   This is why maybe I should be I should be keeping all my notebooks because maybe one day we can have
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.840]   The trans the cows collection cows philosophical notebooks. I think it'd be less interesting
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.400]   but maybe one day people could look at my time management strategies and
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.640]   wonder
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.400]   Anyway, so I want to go and do some questions that are
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:59.360]   Vaguely related just in general the questions I pulled out for today are vaguely related to just
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.460]   Systematically planning how you manage your time in your life
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.560]   So just sort of in this general sense of what girdle was trying to do
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.900]   Before I get to that though. I want to mention some of the sponsors to make this show
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.200]   Possible in particular this show is sponsored by
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.800]   better help
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   now I think Kurt girdle was a
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:26.640]   An interesting example to use before we got to this ad because sort of famously later in life girdle
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.720]   struggled
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   with mental health
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:38.200]   What girdle did not have access to which we have access to today in our modern worlds is professionals who can actually help us?
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:44.480]   With our mental health when there is patterns in our thinking that I've moved to a direction that is
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:51.080]   Adding more hardship than good to our life. There are experts who can help you figure out what's going on and come up with strategies
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:58.400]   to gain back control of the cognitive aspect of your life and to help keep you on track for really aiming your life in the
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:04.960]   Direction that you want it to go. There are probably no bigger obstacles to the the dream of
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.160]   Making your life deep than really struggling with what's going on
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.640]   between your ears
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.920]   Now this is where better help enters the scene because if you're thinking about starting therapy
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.160]   Better help is a great way to do this. Here's why it's entirely online
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.800]   It's designed to be convenient flexible and suited to your schedule
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.320]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire and you'll get matched with a licensed therapist
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.120]   And if it's not quite the right fit you can switch therapist anytime for no additional charge
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.480]   So if there's some struggle that's going on in your life right now, that's really being
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.120]   Causing some issues really holding you back
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.840]   Talk to a therapist and use better help to get into this because it's it's the easiest most convenient flexible way
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   I think to actually enter into
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.640]   Getting some professional assistance on getting this part of your life
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.680]   Working properly. So let therapy be your map with better help

[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.280]   Deep questions
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.320]   By talking about deep questions, I also want to talk about our friends at
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.240]   80,000 hours
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:42.280]   So 80,000 hours is a nonprofit that aims to help people have a positive impact with their career
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.960]   So look we've been talking about in this show
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.880]   How do you structure your life in a way that is intentional and deep and one of the things you might care about?
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.240]   is taking the thing you probably spend the most of your waking hours doing which is your job and
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:00.480]   Aiming that to have as much positive impact as possible. This is what 80,000 hours helps people do now
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.700]   This number is not arbitrary. Where does 80,000 hours come from?
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:09.400]   You work 40 hours a week 50 weeks a year for 40 years that multiplies out to 80,000 hours
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.280]   So the whole point is how do you take those 80,000 hours effort and make sure that you are getting?
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.800]   the most impact out of them
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.320]   80,000 hours will help you do that. They've spent the last 10 years conducting research alongside
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.680]   academics at Oxford University to figure out how to
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:33.200]   Do this I have known these guys at 80,000 hours since the early days of this nonprofit getting started
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.880]   This is back when I was writing about career satisfaction was so good
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:42.300]   They can't ignore you and we had huge overlap in the ways we were thinking about things. So I've known the 80,000 hour people
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.600]   For probably a decade now so I can tell you from a personal perspective
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.680]   They really align with the way I think about jobs
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:56.560]   They push really away from this mindset of just there's one job. You're meant to do and follow your passion and have this much more
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.240]   instrumental Cal Newport style vision for
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.840]   deploying your job
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.000]   Towards certain ends tweaking the attributes of your jobs being more systematic when you think about how your job fits into your bigger goal
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   So there really are on board with the type of things I think about so if you go to 80,000 hours org
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.160]   You will find all of their research. You will find all of their guides
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.080]   About forming a high-impact career
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:27.340]   They also have a podcast where they host unusually in-depth conversations with experts on the world's most pressing
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:33.660]   Problems, they really get some smart people on there. Check out the David Chalmers interview on
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.840]   Artificial consciousness if you're interested in AI you have to listen to that one and they have a job board
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.760]   But they have a curated and constantly updated list of hundreds of active job openings
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.000]   That they think might have a particularly big impact
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.680]   so 80,000 hours
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.720]   We are on the the same wavelength here
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.280]   When it comes to how to think about jobs and the way we actually think about things
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:06.480]   So I'm going to suggest you go over to 80,000 hours org add a slash deep to the end of that
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.520]   Go to 80,000 hours org slash deep
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.800]   That way they'll know you came from me
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.720]   Everything there is free
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:23.220]   It's a nonprofit. They only want to aim to help you out. So go check it out at 80,000 hours org slash deep
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:29.200]   If you're there join their newsletter, you might as well because they will send you a free copy of their in-depth research led career guide
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   That's 80,000 hours the number
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.240]   dot org slash deep
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.660]   All right, Jesse. Let's go deep now on some
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.440]   questions we will now put on our Kurt Gerdl hat and try to figure out how we two can
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:48.960]   Systematically structure our life to if not solve the incompleteness theorems at least do something worthwhile. Who's our first question today?
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.920]   All right first questions from Rito
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.320]   Rito says outside of work. I keep jumping from one thing to another without gaining much progress
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:03.840]   I start with a lot of excitement and when the rubber hits the road after a short while I lose interest and jump to another
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.920]   Thing because that's exciting. How do I keep doing what I start?
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:14.000]   Well, Rita, this is a very common issue. So I'm glad you brought it up. There's nothing unusual that you're struggling with this
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.840]   the fact that we're talking about
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.980]   Projects outside of work makes this problem even more acute because when you're working on a project a course for your job
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:29.200]   There's a real natural incentive to keep going which is my boss wants me to do this
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.520]   And if I don't do this, it's going to be a problem and I don't want it to be a problem because they give me
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.280]   Money for this job. I need the money to live in work motivation can be much easier
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:44.960]   For projects outside of work the type of things we talked about in so many of the deep life buckets. We tackle on this show
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:52.560]   Motivation gets harder. So I have a couple things to suggest for you here first. I'm gonna say let's get smarter about how you choose
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.640]   These non-professional projects, especially if you are having trouble right now
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.280]   Following through I'm gonna suggest you move to smaller projects
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.360]   that are more tractable you understand how to accomplish them and
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.920]   What it means to finish them and it's not that far away three weeks. I could be done two weeks. I could do this
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.680]   This is something I'm going to do this weekend and you want to focus on projects early on that having a tangible
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:24.680]   Immediate benefit it's gonna take me a week when I'm done. I will have built this thing. I will have
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.760]   Finished this running route. I will have
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:34.160]   Started this new workout routine, whatever it is. It's it's a very tangible. I've done it. Here's the benefit
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.840]   Because what I'm gonna suggest here is that at first you want to stack these smaller more self-contained
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:46.240]   projects on top of each other to make progress in a direction you care about as opposed to as an alternative trying to come up
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   with just one massive project
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.000]   So if there's an area of your life you say
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:59.060]   You know, I want to get really into making DIY making with printers and laser cutters or this or that you could set some big project
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.300]   Of okay. I'm gonna go rent the space and build a big lab
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.580]   I get really good at making things and be like Adam Savage in his cave
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:13.140]   But that's a huge project and if you're already struggling with non-professional motivation, that's gonna Peter out. It seems endless
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:17.780]   It's difficult to get stuck. So what you want to do instead is stack smaller projects
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:24.020]   I want to buy these two very specific pieces of supplies and buy it and build this thing and it's gonna take me a week
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:29.160]   All right. Now this weekend I'm going to go to the garage and I want to clear out a corner
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.380]   I'm gonna set up this desk and buy a task light and make a sort of small little space in there. Okay, that's tractable
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.900]   That's done. All right. Now I'm gonna build this more elaborate project. It's gonna take me another week, right?
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.180]   So you're doing these
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.340]   Smaller self-contained projects that you can push through and finish pretty quickly and they're stacking up to push you
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.800]   Continually in the direction of what you more broadly want to accomplish like in this example to be
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.680]   Someone who has DIY making as a bigger part of their life. So you're stacking smaller tractable
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.800]   Projects not trying to take on giant projects. You could see the same thing when fitness
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:08.380]   You could say okay. I want to I want to look like Chris Pratt in Jurassic World
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.860]   My boys and I watched that last night. That's a huge goal
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:18.460]   Right, right. That's like very difficult to do and it's three hours a day of training and you know
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.540]   And you're not you're probably not gonna get there and you lose interest in it. That's too broad
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.060]   But what you could do is take the first step towards getting into better shape
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.220]   okay, like so this is what I want to do is I don't know I want to have a
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.420]   cardiovascular habit
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.460]   so I'm gonna like research and buy the right shoes and get a route and
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.460]   get some baseline time for that route and have a
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.820]   Thing up on the wall where I keep track of what my times are and like you do that after a week
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.300]   You're like, okay
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.660]   I've done that thing and now I I know how to run of the ability to run I can keep track of my route times
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.660]   That's just like a step in the right
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.140]   Direction or it's okay. I'm going to buy this particular
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.400]   Type of fitness equipment and see if I can do like one week of this program
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.500]   So like I have a routine for that. So these are smaller things that again can stack and move you
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.700]   Move you in the right right direction
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.100]   Okay
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:10.780]   Now once you have these smaller projects you're stacking smaller projects deploy pre-scheduled time and daily disciplines to help make it automatic
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.780]   If you fall back on am I in the mood to run today?
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.260]   Am I in the mood to work on my DIY project today too often?
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.020]   The answer is going to be no so you want that time when you're doing your weekly plan to be pre-scheduled
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.860]   Put it on your calendar. This is when I do it if possible make something special around it. I'm coming home from work early
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.380]   I'm taking an extended lunch hour
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.940]   I'm going into work late this day so that I can get this run in or work on this project, right?
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:39.820]   So you're especially protecting the time not putting into the whatever dregs happen to be available
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:45.940]   Daily disciplines are great. If it's like this is just what I do. I exercise I go for a run right after work every day
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.900]   I
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.100]   Come in the door change do that and then that's really when my day is over and I'm back home for my family
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.420]   So daily disciplines plus pre-scheduled time don't leave it up to your own
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.620]   motivation in the moment
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.100]   Now here's the thing Rito if you do this for a while
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:06.460]   As we talked about I think two episodes ago, or maybe this was even last episode
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:14.100]   Your sense of yourself will change in particular your sense of yourself as a disciplined person who can
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:20.020]   Make consistent project progress on a hard project that sense of yourself will develop
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.940]   Discipline is not we've talked about this before on the show
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.980]   discipline is not a
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:33.580]   Approach you can decide to take it's not an attribute you can turn off and on. Oh, I think I should be more disciplined
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.180]   It's an identity
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's something you feel about yourself
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.420]   I'm a disciplined person or I'm not and the only way to develop that identity is to actually make progress on completing things you make
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.420]   things that you contractively complete
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:49.500]   You schedule that time on your calendar you do daily disciplines do this for six months
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.900]   You're gonna find yourself in the future saying you know what? I don't need to break it up so much. I
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.660]   See myself as someone who can take on and follow through on big projects. So that will get easier anyways
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.980]   Great great question though Rito. I do appreciate that
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.260]   I will say Jesse Chris Pratt was muscular in that movie. That was my main takeaway
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.380]   Yeah, were you following his work hours? That's somebody else
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.540]   That was someone else though I was doing
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:22.100]   That was Thor right Thor Chris Hemsworth. I did his program
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.380]   I got his app sinner and I did go through its it was three or four months
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.940]   And he had a program for you could do with dumbbells only so I like to home gym
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.540]   And I finished it up here because I have membership of the gym. So I did I did go through that program. I
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.980]   Liked it nice. Here's the thing. It's not what he's doing
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:47.780]   The other thing I found out about the you know doing the weird stuff for the movies is
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.420]   So much of that is diet too. It's
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.660]   Thor Hemsworth talked about this the amount of food it
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.820]   They're adding 40 pounds of muscle. It's like a huge amount of food
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.300]   They have to eat at the same time that they're doing super intense working out the developed muscle
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.460]   But they have to eat a huge amount of food to actually just literally
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:15.140]   Have the mass that they put in there at the same time. They're also cutting and sure so they're they're cutting body fat
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.620]   Well consuming just huge amounts of boring food
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.060]   It doesn't sound fun
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.820]   I'm sure those guys that have to do those roles are like, oh my god
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.820]   six months and six months of this
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.060]   All right, but I digress I'll do another question what we got
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.180]   All right. Next question is from Lily. I
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:39.100]   noticed Cal bringing more focus on the issue of setting up one's environment and was wondering if he thinks that
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:45.900]   Environment is something we should think of as a bucket like craft or contemplation or is it more like a major project?
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:52.900]   Well, you know clearly I have been thinking about environment being up here in the deep work HQ North as we talked about the opening
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   Of the show I have been finding
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:01.020]   Being in this different quieter more natural location. That's different than my normal routines as
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:07.020]   I predict is making a big impact. I I do think it does support clearer thinking I do think it does
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:14.700]   Support more insight. I do think it does support sense of cognitive recharge. So yes, I'm as Lily's pointing out a
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.740]   Big believer in environment. I don't think we don't think enough about it. So where does this fit into our
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:26.100]   Contemplation of the deep life. Well, I think it fits more neatly when we switch to the deep life stack
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:31.500]   So we've been shifting from this conception of the deep life on the show as
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.220]   Just being made made up of buckets that you address and we've instead
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:41.040]   changed to this notion of the deep life as being a stack with different layers that build on each other and you work your way
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.560]   Through and establish each layer till you get to the top and you can iterate and go back through again and again
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:50.820]   And that's the iterative process of forming the deep life now in our deep life stack. What's the topmost layer?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.740]   It's the vision layer
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.300]   It's the layer in which you plan for the remarkable
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:03.320]   So below this you have all the other things that help you get there and also just give you a strong foundation in your life
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.920]   Remember you start with discipline re-establishing discipline then you move on the values
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:14.800]   Here is my code and here is the for how I live my life at good times and bad and here's the rituals that I
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   Have in my life to help keep me constantly
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.440]   Reconnected to the core elements of that code. It just helps me live and understand that
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.880]   Then on top of that depending on which version of the stack we have you either go right to calm
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.580]   Where you control your your time and obligations for calm or you can add in which I've been doing more recently my thinking a service
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.360]   layer serving people around you so you want to make sure that you're
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:43.800]   connecting to other people and leading other people and serving other people because that's at the core of our species then you get the
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:50.120]   Calm layer we are finding calm by controlling your time and obligations. So now you have the breathing room to actually do things
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.880]   you have the breathing room to actually have insight and on top of all of that is planned for the remarkable the vision layer and
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   In that layer is where you take a particular
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.240]   Target and say I want to push this part of my life to something more remarkable and building off all these other layers below
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:09.040]   I'm much more well suited to do that. I'm much more well suited to understand what's important to me and I'm much more
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   Well suited to succeed
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.560]   With the goal of pushing a part of my life to be more remarkable
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.920]   Overhauling parts of your environment would be one of these types of projects you would do at that top layer
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   So at this time you're constantly coming back to this top layer and as you iterate and say what's another part of my life?
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.120]   I want to push towards being remarkable. That's where I think that happens
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.240]   And so it might mean okay as I'm working on my top layer
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.440]   I'm going to take a
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.400]   portion of my house and I'm going to completely change it to be
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:45.760]   Much more dramatic as a place for doing work or it could be something much broader like I want a deep deep work HQ North
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.920]   I want property that I go to for six six weeks a year and how am I gonna make that happen?
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.280]   I have to start thinking through it would be really remarkable. But how am I gonna make that happen?
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.320]   So I think with the deep life stack these type of things make more sense
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.320]   The place you're gonna spend your most time once you've really got these other layers locked in
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:10.240]   Is gonna be that top layer where you're just systematically taking parts of your life that are important to you and making it more remarkable
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.720]   things about your job things about your
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.960]   fitness things about
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.040]   Intense leisure very serious leisure habits you have and things like the spaces you're in
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:28.080]   So I'll say Jesse for example, I'm I've been motivated. I think this academic year
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.400]   I
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.400]   Have a couple spaces in mind back
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:36.280]   Back in DC where I want to start doing some work and I think one of them is I want to do another
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.580]   Update to the HQ. Let's keep pushing this thing
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.760]   I think the office the office of the HQ let's I think we could make that cooler
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.440]   Like I'm thinking about I think the desks we have in there
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.040]   Are a little rickety
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.120]   Like let's get how really don't you think what if we got some?
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:00.960]   Really solid maybe just custom-built wood all the way around the room that you could just thump down on that thing
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:06.720]   And and it's not you know, this shaky thing. I want to there's nothing on the walls there
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.760]   I want to cover the whole yeah, we should hang that we should hang that one picture
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:16.280]   Yeah, we have this great piece of artwork that the grandkids of the art is as an artist whose whose work hangs in MoMA
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.800]   With this great piece of artwork
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:25.120]   That is she was taking a circuit schematics in the 1950s and 60s and building abstract artworks out of them
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.840]   We have a great frame piece of artwork her grandkids sent us and we just have to hang it
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.080]   I want to put a whole pegboard on the wall
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.080]   across from the 3d printer
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:40.480]   Like in a workshop from which we can hang tools and all the all the different stuff that's being used in the the the maker
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.600]   portion
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.960]   Of the office so we have like tools and things hanging off of the hanging off the wall there
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   That'll I'm gonna be cool. Yeah, I think it'll be cool. Yes. I mean
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.200]   Yeah, the desk idea is good, too
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.240]   Yeah, I get real all the way around the room
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:03.880]   Kind of really cool custom. So it's really solid so you could just have one chair and just be rolling like here's the here's the
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.320]   Monitor you can go over to the printers or stuff and go over to the the workbench side and have like task lights
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.120]   It was I want to make that room really cool
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   So I've that I have that type of thought in mind
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.800]   Continuing to work on some of the spaces and in my house. So I'm thinking about it
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.440]   I think spaces is cool. And I want to I want to when I'm planning for the remarkable I want to have more of
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.120]   More focus more focus on spaces
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.280]   You know what? I want. I think would be cool. I think we need an on-air light outside our studio
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.840]   It's a small thing. I think that'd be cool
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:39.400]   Yeah, that would be cool. Just uh, yeah, just just turn that turn that thing on. All right, let's uh, let's keep rolling
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.640]   What do we got?
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.560]   All right next questions from anal in the show
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.720]   You talk about lifestyle centric career planning and this fully resonates with my way of thinking about life
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.800]   And I see it as the best way to building a life you want to have but how do I find?
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.440]   examples of the lifestyles I desire
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.560]   Another good question obviously with lifestyle centric career planning
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.840]   What we're talking about with that is that you begin by fixing?
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.880]   The vision of your ideal lifestyle and then you work backwards to figure out practically speaking
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.820]   How do I get as close as possible to that lifestyle image?
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.360]   The key thing in this planning is the lifestyles not just career
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.400]   It's it's all aspects of your life. What type of place do you live?
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.640]   I mean, it's it are you on a mountain? Are you in a small town?
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.040]   are you in a high rise in the city and going to
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:33.360]   Coffee shops where there's a vibrant discussion or is it more you're going for walks in the woods?
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:39.160]   Is it you're near family and they're all coming over and it's like in the opening of that old NBC show
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:45.880]   Parenthood with sort of lights cafe lights hanging in this yard and people are sitting around picnic tables. Like what are you imagining?
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:52.640]   What is resonating you you're surfing out in the waves each morning or it's more of a Masters of the Universe type
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.720]   I'm controlling these businesses or making moves and breaking things and I have all these people who are working under me
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.960]   all these type of visions
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:07.120]   So you're making this this concrete tactile vision of a lifestyle that really resonates and then you figure out
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.640]   Okay, how do I get there and a big part of that answer is going to be the job portion
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:17.280]   Well, okay. How am I gonna for this location? What type of job would have there? What flexibility do I need?
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.100]   What level do I need to be at so really helps you make career decisions pragmatically, but other things as well
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:28.340]   What am I doing with the rest of my time? How am I structuring my life? Where am I living location decision?
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.340]   So that's lifestyle centric
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.800]   Planning and of course the hard part is how do you figure out that lifestyle?
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:39.160]   And I think the issue here is it sounds like you're looking for perhaps an individual
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.520]   To be the exemplar of everything you're looking for
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.840]   This guy I want to be
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.800]   Kurt Gerdl, you know, and so let me just try to
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.440]   mimic
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.320]   Mimic everything he has in his lifestyle that sometimes works and it's great
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.000]   If it does what I think is more common is that you're going to pick and choose
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:05.520]   Aspects of lifestyles from different people that you're going to then put together into your own image
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.840]   So what you're really looking for is you want to encounter real-life case studies of real people and it could be people
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.180]   You know
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:16.280]   or they could be famous people or people you see on YouTube where you watch a documentary about or read about in books and
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.600]   You've listened for this sense of resonance
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.680]   It's a really clear feeling where there's something about this person. You're seeing in a video
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.240]   Or in a book that just feels right
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.840]   And what you want to figure out is what exactly about?
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.560]   What I'm looking at here is
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.480]   Causing that sense of resonance and I would suggest you have a place to write this down
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.160]   Everyone should have a notebook that's dedicated to just
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.120]   their life
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.240]   The quest for a deeper life. This was you know for me famously my moleskins
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.520]   I'm now doing this in my remarkable which we'll talk about later
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.640]   But you should have a notebook dedicated to this where you can keep track of these notes and over time
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.240]   You'll see certain things will come up again and again this book this documentary this person
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.320]   I met in all cases that resonated with me because of this one aspect of their lives
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.160]   You'll see that thing show up again and again. So you say great. This should be a part of my ideal lifestyle
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:12.600]   and you have to keep in mind sometimes these examples will be unusual right that the
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:19.960]   Broader details of these examples that are spurring residents might be completely foreign to anything you might want to do
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.040]   Like let me just give you a very concrete example. A lot of my listeners
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.560]   Have sent me
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.800]   Links to the documentary Jiro dreams of sushi
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:35.120]   It's a great documentary about this. I think he's a three-star Michelin
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:41.880]   Chef it's a sushi master and his restaurant is in a subway station in Tokyo
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:47.520]   There's nothing fancy, but his entire life is just obsessively mastering the art of
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:54.640]   Doing sushi at the highest possible level and people travel from all around the world to try to come to this small
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.240]   Restaurant and sit at the counter
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.400]   Inside a subway station now that resonated for example with a lot of my listeners not because they want to be sushi chefs
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:08.320]   Not because they want to work long hours in a subway station. What was resonating?
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.480]   craft
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:17.920]   They were they were sensing look this person is really focused on mastering a craft and out of that is getting significant
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.960]   personal satisfaction
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.520]   That is an element you can pull out of that example that you can then apply to your lifestyle vision that you okay
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.760]   I want to be working on something be really good at something and have a craft that can really take some pride in
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.160]   That's a really good insight and it came from an unlikely place
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.760]   It's like I for whatever reason find various residences when I watch things about the big wave surfer
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.360]   Laird Hamilton, I have no interest in being a big wave surfer. I don't trust going into the ocean
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:53.320]   I don't trust making myself in the shark food. I don't even like going in boats, but there's just aspects about the
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:54:01.420]   The intentionality especially where he lives on the old pineapple plantation in Maui or Kauai
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:07.120]   I'm not sure exactly where it is. There's just aspects of his life that resonated about a sort of intentionality and
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.920]   location really mattering and he also has a sort of dedication to
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.560]   his work as being a source of
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.520]   interestingness and
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.400]   Challenge and not just as trying to climb some type of ladder
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:25.000]   He did not go the professional surfing route and did this own thing. There's real lessons in there that resonate with me even though I
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:32.720]   Don't wear board shorts. I don't live in Hawaii and I you know, I hate I'm terrified of the ocean essentially
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   so what I'm trying to say here is
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:42.280]   You're deconstructing things to cause sense of resonance to figure out what the small elements are and you write this all down and you do
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:47.720]   That long enough a pretty clear image will arise of these are the things that matter to me and then the fun part comes
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:56.440]   The planning for the remarkable part where you begin shaping your life towards those things now you have some actual now you have some actual direction
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:02.480]   Laird Hamilton, so, you know him at all. Have you seen any of his stuff Jesse?
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.640]   Yeah, I um, he's been on Ferris a couple times. So I listen to those I've listened to
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:15.760]   Some of the episodes with his wife. I have this coffee creamer that I occasionally use. I like that creamer
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.600]   Yeah, yeah, I like it at times
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.800]   Yeah times did I had the turmeric one?
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:30.400]   For a while. I talked about branding. That's entirely something. Why did I buy that brand that it just layered?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.080]   Yeah, imagine him
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.680]   With his like, you know in Maui
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.120]   With a tree trunk legs like we're gonna go like invent some new thing to surf some cool wave
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:46.440]   You're like I just want in what are you selling? Yeah, that's great. You know, that's like pure
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:52.560]   That's pure sort of the Olympic athlete on the Wheaties box marketing and I love it. I'm here. I'm here for that
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.400]   You know, that was definitely I still have it. I gotta use it again. I haven't yeah, I haven't used in a while
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:02.800]   Yeah, he's interesting guy. He lives he lives full speed, you know, which which I he does a lot
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:07.320]   Workouts in the pool with like dumbbells like at the bottom. Yeah, he invented that
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:12.200]   I've seen it for sure. I forgot what it's called. But yeah, he invented a whole new way of working out
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.720]   Yeah, just terrible but awesome. Yeah, well you work out underwater
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.240]   Which is such a dumb thing to do. Yeah, but have you heard there's there's actually
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:28.160]   Some NBA players got into it, right because they could you could really practice
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.720]   Like vertical leap and jumping and stuff like this with no impact on your legs
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:37.540]   And so coming off of injury you could actually do a lot of training, but he's basically a crazy person. He's just
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:42.660]   What Jesse is describing here is what you would think he is in the bottom of a swimming pool in Malibu
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.240]   with like heavyweights exercising
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.080]   underwater
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:52.340]   Because there's no resistance so like you can do I don't know. He also has brought he got really into
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.000]   Saunas and ice baths, right? Yeah, I seem to be right now. And so he brought
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.920]   This terrible piece of exercise equipment. So people are saying look I'm gonna sit in the sauna for 20 minutes and this is so hard
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:11.120]   So he wanted to one-up everyone so he brought in one of these attack bike things. Have you seen these it's like
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.400]   Oh, yeah, so bikes assault. Yeah. Yeah, which is a very hard cardio workout, right? It's like impossible
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:21.840]   It's your arms your legs. So he brought an assault bike into the sauna. So he said I'm not just gonna sit in the sauna
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.600]   I'm gonna do the hardest possible like cardio exercise in the sauna
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:33.060]   He wears oven mitts because the the the handlebars are too hot. They could burn his hands. So he's wearing oven mitts
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:41.160]   Oven mitts in a sauna doing the hardest possible exercise before getting into an ice bath bath afterwards. He's a crazy man
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:41.960]   He's a crazy man
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:46.100]   and what I've learned about all that stuff and the saunas and the ice baths and all the craziness is you know
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:50.760]   It's not so much about like what exactly can we measure some particular?
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.480]   physiological effect I just think for these
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.480]   elite level
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.000]   Athletes and training they just they need the they need discipline and challenge
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   I think this is partially why really extreme sauna ice bath challenge have worked our ways in the routine
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   It's a lot of these people are just looking for
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.200]   Discipline and challenges and moving their body through more. I think it's as much psychological as probably it is physiological
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.640]   Yeah
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:24.280]   Yeah, but maybe we'll need to get so I'm adding this to the list for our property for the HQ North so we have
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.000]   professional assault like or a sauna
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.960]   Sauna ice bath. No, no assault bike
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.640]   Maybe no, you can't have a swimming pool up here
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:37.120]   So we're not gonna do underwater weightlifting and then we have your putting green. So we're making
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.080]   The list is growing I would love that
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.280]   That's what Hamilton had by the way speaking of deep work HQ North is he has this
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.760]   I don't know if you still have it probably does he bought this cool property near
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.920]   That wave he made famous jaws
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.640]   Piappi or whatever. It's called. He bought this old pineapple plantation
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.320]   Near where this giant wave was that he sort of helped innovate
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:06.120]   big wave riding on and he just does all these projects in the offseason he has all this equipment and
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:13.800]   You know back hose and ATVs and because he gets bored. They're all there's it's this huge property with all these vehicles
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.440]   They're always like kind of doing cool stuff while they're waiting for the waves to come
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:22.600]   Yeah, the deeper case you north is gonna be like a a much less physically fit
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:28.400]   Version of that so instead of like a TV to dig a trench will be you know
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.480]   Strolling to read a book by like a bench, but whatever a lot of a lot of things going on
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.640]   All right enough this nonsense. Let's keep rolling. What do we got next?
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.320]   All right next questions from Anna. I
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.000]   Have worked very hard to get my current job by ruining to get to my current job by
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.640]   Removing distractions and focusing on rare and valuable skills because I'm good at time management
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.840]   I can now realistically work about 20 hours a week and do more than enough to keep my boss happy
[00:59:54.840 --> 01:00:01.680]   Recently, I've been presented with the chance to move to a late-stage startup where I'd be more stimulated in terms of role
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.840]   But would need to work a lot more hours
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:09.480]   I'm sort of bored of my current job, but I have a lot of free time. I could spend on other things
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.560]   Should I switch jobs?
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:20.280]   Well, first of all, there's a case study aspect to this embedded which is for those who who look at the type of
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:27.160]   Time and task management strategies we talked about sometimes on this show and see them as somehow
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.480]   ways to do more work who will cast
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:38.760]   multi-scale planning and task capture these type of things we talked about for the the calm layer of the deep life stack and say well
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.560]   that's just about optimization and you're just turning yourself into a
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.000]   Machine of profits to do ever more work. This shows you the counterpoint
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.320]   Because this is the other thing you can do when you can control what's on your plate
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.680]   You can decide what you want to do with that
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.080]   And yes
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:59.560]   It is possible to say like I do sometimes to my regret and say great now I can fit four jobs into nine to five
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.440]   Instead of one that's one thing you can do and I've done that at times
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.720]   But you can also do what Anna did is say great
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.160]   I work takes about 20 hours a week and everyone thinks I'm a superstar
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.840]   that's the flip side of
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.240]   Controlling your time and obligations as you actually get control over
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:21.160]   The workload you have knobs you can turn now. Let's get that Anna's particular point. She's so good at this that she's bored
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.520]   Right. She's working 20 hours doesn't really have anything else going on and saying should I go to another job?
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.600]   There's gonna be much more time. It's gonna be much more intensive. It's gonna take much more hours
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.280]   She elaborated we didn't we didn't put it all in here
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.920]   But she elaborated more about what that new job would be like
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:41.600]   There'd be new skills to pick up and she was saying she would have to prove herself. So, you know late-stage startups
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.440]   It's definitely a place where you just need to demonstrate
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.800]   Energy and value no 20 hours. That's gonna be not no 20 hour weeks there. It's gonna be 60 hour weeks
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.120]   So should she switch jobs?
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.240]   Well, Anna the issue what that's gonna come down to is your lifestyle vision
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.920]   This is we're having clarity on this is what I want my lifestyle to be like all aspects work and non work is going to be
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   really important
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.960]   Because getting that straight is going to give you clarity about okay, what role does my career play here?
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.760]   So if you go through this vision and you're saying okay where I want to be in this vision and I could be here in
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:23.480]   Three years is one where you know, maybe it involves your you're starting a family or you're writing novels or you want to
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.320]   Live in nature and be able to like spend long times
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.360]   Hiking or like surfing or something like this then you would say great
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.360]   I'm bored right now at this 20 hour a week job
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.920]   But this is the right foundation for this lifestyle image that I'm trying to get towards
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.640]   Let me keep that and I'll be
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.400]   Systematic right now in the other parts of my life moving me towards that setting me up for the move setting me up for learning
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.960]   This skill changing from you know in person to remote you have work to do now. This is the right engine
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.160]   Professionally, let me work towards getting towards this lifestyle image on the other hand
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.720]   maybe when you do this lifestyle centric career planning your thing like I'm bored and
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:05.080]   the image I have in mind of where I'd like my lifestyle to be is one where I'm more in the thick of things and
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.280]   I'm plugged into I've seen
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.960]   Her current job. She didn't we cut this out for for length, but she's working as a chief of staff for a
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.920]   Sort of a more well-known figure. So maybe she's thinking that well-known figure
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.840]   That life is what I'm looking for
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.840]   You know, like you've had a successful company and that was really hard
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.400]   but now you're doing some investing and maybe you're also you have a vision of I'm oscillating back and forth between
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:34.520]   just sitting back and investing and then building up companies from scratch to make an impact and I want to live in the thick of
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520]   things and
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.760]   Be on stage with a thousand people as I give a talk about what I've learned like maybe that's the image that resonates
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.020]   It's really clear. Yeah, I got to leave this 20 hour a week job and go to the late-stage start up and crush it over
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:50.840]   There I got to figure out how to really make myself known orient my whole life there about using all of my
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.120]   time management skills to just be a superstar and
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.640]   I have that I can put up with that for two years be really hard because I think I'm gonna be able to jump from
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.800]   There to doing my own startup and you could have a whole different vision
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:07.160]   Your lifestyle is what matters here. The lifestyle vision you're aiming towards is what allows you to make all of these
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:13.800]   Decisions in the absence of that bigger picture vision that really resonates the decisions become
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   arbitrary
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.600]   You'll focus in on one thing. I don't know. I'm bored right now
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.860]   I don't want to be bored and then six months later. You're stressed out of your mind
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.480]   Working till 11 every night because people wonder why the lights off if you're not there and think why did I do this?
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:33.360]   Like I solved the boredom problem and created a whole nother problem, you know other parts of my life are falling apart, right?
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.520]   So we don't want to be making knee-jerk or arbitrary decisions
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.000]   And again having that ideal lifestyle that you're looking towards is really helpful
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.360]   Now if you're struggling to do that, there's a couple things you can do
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.020]   There's the advice we just gave before of in a previous question
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:54.560]   Look for things to resonate figure out what parts of the resonate write that all down and see what emerges
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.860]   This is also we're working through the full deep life stack matters
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:05.680]   So part of the value of moving through the deep life stack before you get to this final layer where you make these big changes
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.600]   Where you change your career where you pursue big projects
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:13.280]   So one of the reasons why you go through all these layers is that it prepares you
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.160]   for better identifying these visions that matter when you become a
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:26.160]   establish your discipline when you figure out what your values your code and you have rituals that connect you deeply and
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.800]   intuitively to the things that really matter that you build your life on top of when you're serving other people on a
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.160]   Regular basis when you have control, which you probably already have of your time and obligations
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   It's much easier than to say with confidence. This matters. This doesn't this is important to me
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.780]   There's a core calmness and clarity that comes from that
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.440]   So get that lifestyle image really clear
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:53.020]   move through all the deep life stack layers and start keeping a notebook of what resonates if you don't have that lifestyle image and then use
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.140]   That to make your decisions do not allow this to be a knee-jerk decision
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:01.740]   All right, so what I want to do now is
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.300]   I'm gonna jump forward to
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.100]   Talk about my own experience
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:12.200]   With my newest gadget to juror, which is my remarkable to tablet
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.940]   Before we get there. I just want to mention another one of the sponsors that makes this show possible
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.180]   And that is our friends at element
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.820]   LM in T
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.760]   Now element is I've mentioned this before this is a product
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.620]   It was an early sponsor of the show and I liked it so much that I was just using it in
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:35.220]   The years since then and so when they came back and said they want the sponsor again
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.620]   I said well, I'm glad because I already own it because I've been using this product already now what it is is a
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.540]   electrolyte drink mix
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:46.300]   That's everything you need and nothing. You don't so it has lots of salt, especially if you're sweating
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.380]   Which if you live in DC means basically all the time
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.300]   But no sugar
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:57.900]   So you have this science-backed electrolyte ratio a thousand milligrams sodium 200 milligrams potassium 60 milligrams magnesium
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:03.220]   Without sugar without coloring without artificial ingredients. No gluten. No filter. No
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.900]   BS so you have the ability to keep up with electrolyte needs
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:16.140]   Even if you're a keto or low car or paleo or just don't want all of the weirdness that's in typical other sports drinks
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.140]   so this is the way I use it is when I exercise I
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.900]   Put element in my water afterwards because I sweat a lot because it's a roughly and I'm again
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:30.900]   I'm looking at the National Weather Service here a billion percent humidity and terribly hot. That is the forecast in DC
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.660]   basically from June through
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:39.460]   September stupidly hot and humid I think is the official term if I go hiking for a long walk
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:44.020]   I'm gonna drink it if I wake up feeling dehydrated which often happens, you know, I didn't get enough
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:49.060]   I probably just didn't drink enough last night put element in the water
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:54.240]   You can feel it that it's giving you something you need and it tastes great doesn't have all that junk in it
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.020]   What I do is I titrate
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.940]   So if I just had a like a real sweaty workout, I'll do a full packet
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.580]   But maybe it's just a morning and I'm just feeling a little
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.420]   Dried out. I might put half a packet into the water. So I'll sort of titrate with the packets
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.660]   Anyways, I've tried a lot of different electrolyte mixes
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.340]   Again as a sweater. I need these and
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:20.440]   This is the one this is by far my favorite. So right now element is offering a free sample pack with any purchase
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.560]   That's eight single serving packets free with any element order

[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:59.060]   Jesse when I ran out of the element I brought with me up here. I
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.860]   Bought and I regret this
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:07.820]   I bought this at a supermarket. It's like, oh, here's an electrolyte thing. It was like tablets. I was like, I could put this in my water
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:12.620]   It's the worst thing because you put that you put it in your water bottle, right?
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:18.100]   And the idea is this competitor I won't say its name and you're like great that'll give me electrolytes
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:22.780]   It takes like 10 minutes for this thing to dissolve like Alka-Seltzer
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:26.100]   It just sits there in your water bottle so you can't drink your water
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.460]   So you finish your workout you're super sweaty and you put one of these tablets in the water
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:35.540]   Like I guess I'm just gonna stare at my ice water for 10 minutes before like the electrolytes are like who invented this thing
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:40.620]   Anyways, the point is I really missed my element. I was like, okay, I gotta get back to my element
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.100]   I need to just throw in that packet and get the job done
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:49.180]   All right. I also want to talk about our our good friends at Henson
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.100]   shaving
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.100]   this is the razor that
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:58.620]   This is the the razor that I use. Okay. So what's going on with?
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.340]   Henson, this is a family-owned
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.620]   Aerospace parts manufacturer. This is someone who was making precision parts
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:13.900]   For the International Space Station for the Mars Rover who brought their experience with doing incredibly precise engineering
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.220]   to the problem of getting a good shave
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:23.660]   so a Henson razor is this beautifully milled piece of aluminum into which you just put a
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:31.460]   standard 10 cent safety razor blade and you screw it on and it's precisely milled so that you have just
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.980]   0.0013 inches of blade extending past either side of the razor
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.660]   What this means is when you shave you're not going to get the diving board effect
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.580]   Where the blade goes up and down that's what caused nicks
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.260]   That's what caused clogs you instead get this
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:51.340]   Really clean shave and you get it without having to have 15 different razors in some plastic
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:58.180]   monstrosity that you bought at the drugstore because if you have one really well manufactured if you're if your razor is really well manufactured you
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.300]   Just need one blade to get a good shave
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:06.380]   So this actually makes this an affordable way to get a good shave because yeah you pay more up front for the razor
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:10.860]   But then you're just using these super cheap to buy blades so it doesn't take long
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:15.080]   before the upkeep of your Henson is
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.220]   Significantly cheaper than if you're using a subscription service and significantly cheaper than if you're trying to buy
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:26.860]   The big plastic packed blades at the drugstore. It is what I use. I love the shave
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.060]   I also love how this thing works and as someone who cares about technology
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:36.340]   I'd love nothing more than just a really well-built thing that solves a problem well and does so
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.140]   efficiently
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:44.940]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime visit Henson shaving comm slash Cal
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.700]   Depict a razor for you and use code Cal and you will get two years worth of blades free

[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.900]   Comm slash Cal and use that code
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.060]   Cal
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:21.420]   All right, Jesse the the fans have been asking. I'm gonna load up the website here. They've been asking about my experience with my remarkable 2
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.740]   tablet
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.740]   I'm gonna load it up. They have
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:32.020]   Now let's see here. I'm loading up the website here so for those who are watching again. This is Cal new
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:39.380]   Youtube.com slash Cal Newport media. This is episode 258 or at the deep life comm episode 258
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:47.380]   Let's load up this home page for those who are watching so we can remember all right meet remarkable the paper
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.580]   tablet
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:54.900]   All right, and as we watch this video before we see a very well-dressed contemplative
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:13:01.420]   Woman holding her remarkable. Here's some pictures of it as close to paper as it gets
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:08.900]   so as you can see in this image here the the remarkable for those who don't know is a
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.900]   Electronic notebook
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:18.460]   So you have it's a one page that you can write on it's a Kindle style e-ink
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.740]   So you write on this page and you see what you're writing like handwriting
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.420]   I'm showing some of this on the screen right now and
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:32.980]   You can have endless pages essentially and endless notebooks all in this one thing you hold all of it being backed up
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.460]   To the cloud as well
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:41.420]   All right, so what is my experience been with the remarkable the headline is I really like it
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:47.420]   I'm really liking my remarkable - and here is why I
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:53.260]   Had a lot of notebooks in my life because I have so many different things
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:56.220]   I do these each had their own notebook
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:01.500]   So I had a notebook for example for my moleskin for keeping track of just my general
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:07.820]   Life thoughts the pursuit to have a deeper life, right? I would have notebooks for
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:12.660]   Theory I'm working on computer science papers. I need notebooks to work on
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:18.740]   Ideas mathematical equations this or that I would have multiple notebooks like this. I would have notebooks for
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:26.460]   Planning around the business the the media company we run here. So thinking through how what's our strategy? What's happening?
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:31.500]   What's our vision for the future? I have notebooks to keep track of like my specific
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.060]   What is my what's the specific plan strategic plan?
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:40.220]   I'm working on for you know a particular part of my life and I want to keep notes on it
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.860]   I'll have a notebook for that as well
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:47.000]   I'd have notebooks for book ideas and then a notebook for each particular book
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.180]   I was working on and then just a scratch notebooks because I need to just keep track of ideas. I'm at a meeting
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:58.860]   I'm sketching out a plan a lot of different notebooks were in my life and I was constantly grabbing different notebooks and
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.980]   Using some for other purposes the remarkable solve that problem. I
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:08.900]   Just have a lot of notebooks. I counted there's nine. I've started so far. They're all on the same device
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:14.200]   So I can use the stylus go over select any notebook. I want start taking notes
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:19.180]   And it's just there and then if I want to do something else I can switch over to that notebook and it's right there
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:24.820]   So I've really been I've really been enjoying that it really has been solving the problem. I mean basically the only
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.820]   the only paper notebook that this has not replaced is
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.740]   Time block planning and
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.740]   I tried this I was like, I wonder if I could just like build time block plans or mark
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.320]   Well, I didn't like it right so that was the one place where I wanted
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.420]   spiral binding
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   like the new time block planner has I
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.020]   Wanted something tactile that I could I could write in and see next to me and lie flat next to me
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.260]   And work on throughout the day as I was working on other things
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:54.580]   That's the only real paper notebook that's left in my life right now is my time block planner
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.260]   I really do need that to be analog and with me in all places
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:03.740]   But I've had no problem moving my work notebooks by planning notebooks, even my moleskin notebooks all that's worked
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:07.100]   Well moving to the remarkable now. I talk a little bit about
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:10.220]   How I function with it
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:16.100]   The writing I think is great. It took me a little while to get used to it. Like what's the right pressure?
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.100]   I used to fine liner at narrow
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:23.820]   But once I got used to it, it really for me feels very much like a notebook writing on paper
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.100]   My handwriting is the same as writing on paper. It's it's really identical
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:34.100]   I really like that. I really like that experience. I've learned to use the highlighter a lot as well. So I'd like that
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.340]   I can highlight
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:40.140]   To emphasize things I can I can highlight text. So just from an operational point. That's been great
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:46.420]   It has endless scrolling so you can make your page you can scroll it down as long as you need
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.780]   And then you can add pages
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.240]   So you can scroll the particular page you want to put more on it
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.780]   You can just keep writing longer and longer and then it's very easy just to jump to a new page
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:02.580]   One thing I found myself doing is editing notebooks, which I can't do with paper notebooks, but I do like to do this here
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:07.540]   So for example, I have a notebook where I'm working on the deep life stack
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.660]   the ideas around the deep life stack and
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:15.040]   My particular iteration through the deep life stack right now
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.780]   and one of the things I did was
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:17.280]   You know
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.120]   I had an early version of it on a new page a better version of it than a couple pages with a lot of
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.140]   notes on it in that case I actually went back and
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:30.840]   Deleted some of the older pages and consolidated and rewrote like a okay. Here's the here's the right
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.420]   The right way to do the stack right now. I've tried a bunch of versions
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.500]   I don't want to keep trying I deleted those and added a page and rewrote it, right?
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.580]   so I find myself doing that sometimes with planning notebooks is
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:49.660]   Going back and deleting pages and re-summarizing them as I get better ideas around it. So that that's an interesting twist
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.460]   I didn't expect myself to do
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:56.980]   The backing up features work great. So the way it works is you have an app on your computer
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:01.860]   that if you open it it mimics exactly the navigation of your remarkable and
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.980]   If you go to any of the notebooks in that navigation all your page
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:10.100]   You can just read it all on your computer and you can export any of those pages to PDF
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.100]   I've done that sometimes to print some things
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:18.540]   So can you when you go on the desktop? Can you go in there and type in there? No, so all you can do is
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.100]   See backups and you can read what you wrote in the notebook
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.340]   So you can't type in remarkable either right or is it all just right?
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.660]   Well, I'll get to that in a second because you can and I'll tell you my experience with that
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:34.860]   But the way that app works the desktop app works
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.940]   It just shows you it's a backup of all of your notes
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:42.680]   And so the main useful thing for that is a if you lose your remarkable you have all your notes if you buy a new
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.460]   Remarkable, I'm sure you can transfer it over but you can print those things
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:52.100]   Now if there is something else you so I haven't used these features yet though though it's a
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:58.220]   It's activated. It does now have integration with Google Drive and with Dropbox
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.980]   Because you can bring files. I haven't done this yet, but I want to do more of this
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.220]   You can bring PDFs onto the remarkable
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.020]   read them on the remarkable mark them up on the remarkable and
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   so this is a place where you can be more interactive as you can hook up a particular folder on the remarkable with let's say
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.020]   a Dropbox folder and
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:23.420]   Now if you just put a document like a PDF file into that Dropbox folder, it will automatically appear on
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:28.900]   your remarkable and if on your remarkable you you write it you annotate it an
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:33.700]   Annotated version of that document shows shows up in your Dropbox folder
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.180]   So that's kind of cool same with Google Drive as well
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.300]   So that's kind of cool
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.920]   If you're for example need to edit some papers or something you can just throw
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.940]   Throw papers or articles into a Dropbox and then you're on a train somewhere
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:51.540]   They've all synced up onto your remarkable so you can read them and mark them up and then you know later all that annotation is
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:56.140]   Resynchronized back up with your Dropbox so you know at home on your computer
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.900]   You can print things out with the marks and stuff like that. So I think that's
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.820]   That's that's a nice feature
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.900]   But really the thing is you can't so we're gonna talk about shortcomings
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.660]   three things to mention
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:13.820]   This really is about using the notebook so you can see the stuff you did on your computer
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:18.060]   But you can't you're not really supposed to be it doesn't go back and forth
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.220]   You can't update things on your computer and have that show up on your remarkable
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:28.620]   If you annotate a PDF file that syncs back to your Dropbox, it's going to be a new version of the file with the annotations
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:35.180]   Right because it's its own proprietary world of marking and drawing and stuff like that that the computer doesn't speak. I
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.060]   Got the fancy
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.980]   Folio that has a this really cool built-in keyboard
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.340]   So you can type on it, right?
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:48.140]   so it's actually the the case can become like a
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:53.980]   Surface thing where it a keyboard comes out and it's up like a screen you can type on it
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.980]   I I'm not been using it. I
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.460]   Used it a little bit
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.740]   But the typing experience is not great because you don't have a lot of control over where the text is going to go and you
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.740]   Can't do much with the text once it's on there
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:09.100]   And now at any time you want on a remarkable page you can put in a text cursor and type either on an on-screen keyboard
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:14.500]   Or with the built-in keyboard. I don't like doing it because I don't really know how I don't know how to move the text around
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:19.580]   There's weird things about deleting the text. I mean so I what I've been doing is
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.060]   Really dealing with just handwriting and just saying this is a this is my paper notebook
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.940]   I just have 20 paper notebooks in one form. That's how I've been personally using it
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:30.900]   I have not been using the typing because you know, it's not a word processor
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.180]   It's like the text is going right over here and you can't do anything with it
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.700]   Once you type it it kind of makes me nervous
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.920]   So I don't know if I would pay for the keyboard folio or if you do you would have to have a better use case
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920]   For it. So that's the the second downside
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.380]   The third downside is it's just really expensive
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:53.460]   Once you buy the remarkable you buy the fancy folio you buy the nicer stylus for it I was in
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.620]   $500 plus
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.940]   Which is a lot of money now I could kind of justify it because well
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.140]   It's you know, I talked about on the show and it's you know
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.060]   It fits the type of things we do
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.380]   It is really expensive
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:09.580]   So that would be the other downside
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:15.860]   But in the end so far I've been doing this for a couple months now as a replacement for my stack of random notebooks
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:21.740]   It has been successful and I think I'm probably capturing more notes than I otherwise would
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:26.280]   And I love the experience of using it and as long as I think of it as just these are notebooks that I write in
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.220]   With a pen and that's it and I don't care too much about the computer integration and I don't try to do writing on it
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.940]   I just think of it as notebooks
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.580]   I've been very happy with the experience. I love single-purpose
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:41.860]   Purpose application gadgets things to do one thing and they do that one thing really well. There's no distraction when you're on there
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:45.360]   There's no internet when you're on there. There's just this is me
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.260]   Writing in a notebook and so I'll count myself as a as a remarkable to fan
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:58.980]   But with those caveats that it's it's just for writing and it's expensive. It's expensive as all get out
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.820]   Can you carry it around in your pocket?
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.220]   No, it's the size of like a normal eight eight and a half by eleven piece of paper
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.760]   So I guess my only question is before when you had kind of that life
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:16.500]   Notebook for the moleskins that you carry around your pocket. How do you capture those thoughts if you're I think but I want to care
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:21.960]   You could you could put a moleskin in your pocket, but I want it right because then you would have a big thing in your pocket
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.080]   So I was a bigger one for some reason. I thought I was a little one
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.280]   It was a little one, but I don't the little ones
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.300]   I don't like having in my pocket still like it fits in your pocket, but it's weird to have you know
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:37.600]   It's like having a big wallet in your pocket still, you know, I wouldn't walk around with that in my pocket
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.640]   I don't like having things in my pocket. So I my moleskin was small, but I kept it in my bag
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:45.480]   Okay, so it'd be in it would be in the front pocket of my backpack
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:50.000]   So nothing changed. Yeah, this is the size of like a composition notebook
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:54.120]   So it's a size of a normal piece of paper and maybe like a half-inch thick. It's heavy
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.640]   Which I actually kind of like about it. It's actually kind of heavy. It's very substantial
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.200]   But so that hasn't been a problem
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.600]   Because I I want it. I want it moleskin in my pocket. I would always moleskin in in my my bag anyway
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.360]   So now I just throw this thing
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:15.080]   Throw this thing to my bag. That's the other downside. These are small things the stylus like magnets onto the side, which is cool
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:20.420]   So it just sticks on to it, but you can't put in your bag that way because it'll get knocked off
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:27.980]   Maybe injured so like you keep the stylus separate like in my backpack. It'll be with my my pins and
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:32.660]   The thing will be in the back. These are these are minor points, but I'm a big fan
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:37.460]   I think it's a beautifully engineered product for notebook heads if you keep a lot of notebooks
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:40.660]   You know worth considering
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:46.460]   We messed up that we should have asked him to be a sponsor Jesse because I had to give it a really really good endorsement
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:49.060]   We should do more of that find things
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.060]   I love and then work backwards and ask the people to be like you really need a sponsor
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:58.060]   I've discovered a lot of things I love from sponsors approaches in us, but I thought that'd be cool
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:01.340]   I mean we should at least we should tell remarkable like look. I love your thing
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:04.880]   So you should be our sponsor and also we need 20 remarkables. I
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.260]   Want to give them out like candy oh
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:11.020]   well, all right well speaking of
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:16.020]   Remarkable so I should probably go take some notes, which is my way of saying we should probably wrap up this episode
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.780]   So thank you everyone for listening
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:24.500]   Remember if you like what you heard you will like what you can see you can watch these full episodes and clips at youtube.com
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:31.820]   Slash Cal Newport media will be back next work with another new episode filmed right up here in the deep work HQ north and until
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   Then as always stay deep
