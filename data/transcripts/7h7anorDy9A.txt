[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   So that's the deep dive we want to do today. Today's deep question is are smartphones bad for kids?
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.860]   And if so, how do we know that?
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:19.040]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.040]   The show about living and working deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.020]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined once again by my producer Jesse.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.480]   We had a week off of recording together. It's good to have you back.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.340]   It's good to be back. This is a little known fact about when I solo record.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.680]   Jesse you will attest that when we record we one take it. Yeah, just go live. We just rock and roll warts and all.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.200]   Whenever you're not here
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.680]   It's always two takes. Really? I usually will go about five minutes and then stop and then go back and like take another
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.400]   Run at it. I don't know why. What did you do back in the day?
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.340]   Trying to think back in the very like the deep day
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.500]   When I was early in the podcast I would often
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.720]   When it was all audio, I would off I would stop all the time because it was easy
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.160]   I mean I would just go for a while
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160]   but if I get to a question, it would be really common and I start answering a question and
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.260]   Say I don't really like that and I could just there's just one track and the software was just me
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.120]   It was just audio. I could just go back and like let me take another run at that
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.680]   So the trade-off was I didn't prep I would just list out a bunch of questions and rock and roll
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.000]   But if I didn't like an answer, I might go back and take another run at it
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.820]   Once we started doing video I swapped out around and said well
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.060]   Why don't I actually do a little bit of work up front the prep more the questions?
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.120]   But not take multiple runs at it and that's how we've been doing it and I and I when I'm alone now
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.160]   I do it all you know in one take except for I always have to start twice
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.840]   It's just something about the first time I do it. You're not here throws me off. I get going I'm rambling and
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.120]   And I always start over interesting. Yeah, I don't know what it is. It's not three though. It's never three takes
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.880]   Two takes Jesse's not here. It's two takes
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.600]   So, you know I gave a talk the other day at my kids school
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   Or that it's me and some parents from the middle school. They asked if I would come give a talk about
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.200]   Kids and technology in particular kids and smartphones
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.480]   What do we know about it?
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.600]   How do we know what we know about it and what?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.520]   Conclusions should we take away in terms of what the school policy should be what should be recommended to parents?
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.640]   What parents should be thinking about with respect to their own kids and I figured it's sort of a waste to have done all this
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   research and build all these slides and
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.200]   Only really deliver this information to a one room full of parents. So because I've had this question a lot
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.120]   What is my take on kids and phones and when they should have phones and is it really dangerous?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.920]   I thought we could talk a little bit about that in the show today
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.680]   Yeah, I know that you mentioned it in prior episodes and some fans have been asking for it. Yeah
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.720]   Yeah, and then we'll also we can record this and there'll be a YouTube version of this discussion
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.040]   So if you want to share it with other people who maybe don't listen to the show, but worry about this problem
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.280]   Now this information will be out there. We can point to that video when people ask about it
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.200]   So I thought it would be good. So that's the deep dive we want to do today. Today's deep question is our
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.000]   smartphones
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   bad for kids and
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   If so, how do we know that?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.880]   That's what I want to get into so I have some of my slides here from my talk
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.400]   So, you know if you're listening you might want to consider watching. This is episode
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.320]   246 you can find it at youtube.com slash Cal Newport media or at the deep life
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.400]   Calm if you don't like YouTube's episode 246, I'll explain what I'm saying
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.200]   You don't have to watch it, but I'm just saying if you want to see some of these graphs. I'm referencing
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.760]   Watching the video version of this might be suggested
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.560]   So as I looked into this question of when did researchers become concerned?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.840]   About kids and phones and why the whole story seemed to break up into three acts
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   That's why I called this in my talk a saga in three acts the first act we can start
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.960]   I'm gonna call it roughly
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.000]   2012 to
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   2017 that's the first act of the story. I call it an alarm is
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.560]   Sounded so this is the period where people first began to notice
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.640]   Warning signs. This was actually the period in which the potential issues with smartphones young people was first brought to my attention
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.320]   So I remember as a young professor at Georgetown. This would have been in
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.640]   2012 I was given a talk somewhere on campus and I was walking to the talk with someone who is involved with the student
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.280]   Mental Health Center at Dartmouth is called cat or not Dartmouth Georgetown
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.920]   It's called caps
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.400]   And I it's if you're watching on the screen you see a picture of the the counseling center
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   And I remember smartphones and tech in general was not in my portfolio in 2012 as a writer
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.520]   So we were just having conversation and this person mentioned to me. She said, you know, there's been a big change
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.320]   recently
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.800]   the number of students that we are now treating
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   With mental health counseling here at Georgetown has jumped up and not only has it jumped up but it is
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.480]   Disproportionately jumped up to be anxiety or anxiety related disorders
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.920]   So we're seeing a lot more overall students and a much bigger proportion of the students. We see are here for
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.400]   Anxiety, that was interesting. So what's going on? She didn't skip a beat. She said smartphones
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.160]   And that caught me off guard at the time
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.000]   Smartphones, what do you mean? She said? Oh, it's really clear to me
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.120]   anecdotally that the first group of students to arrive on campus having had
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.200]   Smartphones during their adolescence were showing up way more anxious than we'd ever seen before
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.960]   We can now look back retrospectively and see that this was not an isolated
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.800]   Anecdote happening at just one University. I have a chart on the screen here for those who are watching
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.160]   This is from the American College Health Association annual survey. It's showing percentage of US undergraduates
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.960]   Diagnosed with a mental illness and what do we see?
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.760]   at
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.080]   2012
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.480]   Forward a very sharp uptick in anxiety and depression which are of course quite interlinked by
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.880]   Anxiety to the dark vertical line if you're watching this online
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.200]   It's 2012
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.800]   So what this one person at Georgetown was noticing was actually a nationwide trend that something changed around
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.720]   2012 keep that date in mind. It's going to come up again. I
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.440]   Think the issue got brought to the public's attention writ large so it expanded from
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:50.040]   Individual educators and mental health professionals being worried to the culture writ large being worried about maybe smartphones are causing an issue
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   I think Jean Twenge
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.160]   really helped make this a
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.000]   national issue in her
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.640]   2017 cover article for the Atlantic that was titled have smartphones destroyed a generation
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.440]   The thing about Twenge is that her expertise is in studying
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.280]   Differences between demographic generations. That's what she does
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.560]   How is this generation different than that generation?
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.200]   She's very good at teasing out what's real and what's not and as she said in this article and I have it on the screen
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   As well, she'd been doing this for 25 years
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.440]   And she says typically the characteristics that come to define a generation appear gradually and along a continuum
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.720]   But then I began studying Gen Z around 2012
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.440]   I noticed abrupt shifts in teen behaviors and emotional states the gentle slopes of the line graphs became steep
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.920]   Mountains and sheer cliffs and many of the distinctive characteristics of the millennial generation begin to disappear in
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:53.200]   All of my analyses of generational data some reaching back to the 1930s. I had never seen anything like it
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:00.240]   So this demographer was thrown by how different Gen Z was and not just Gen Z in general, but Gen Z starting in
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.000]   2012
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.080]   She began to make the connection that I think this has to do with smartphones
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.200]   Here's another I think culture defining moment
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.080]   This was also 2017 a big article in the New York Times magazine written by Ben Wadson is that lose?
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.560]   The article is titled. Why are more American teenagers than ever suffering from?
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:29.320]   Severe anxiety and it's important because Ben Wad goes into this article. It's clear from the tone of the article that he is not
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.840]   very hospitable to the technology hypothesis
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.040]   He was seen this as a standard moral panic type argument the same thing
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:44.240]   We always say rock and roll music is going to corrupt the teens brains video games are going to corrupt teens brains
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.320]   And he came into it with that frame, but there's a key point in this article
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.400]   where he talks to actual anxious teenagers and
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.080]   I'm quoting him here to my surprise anxious teenagers tended to agree
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.680]   They didn't say hey old man, leave our phones alone. They said yeah, these things are a problem
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.840]   so by 2017 we've gone from
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:13.120]   Spot reports of wait a second something is changing here these young people. There's something different going on and by
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.720]   2017 we were openly debating is
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.400]   It phones causing these issues
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.600]   All right, this brings us to the second act
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.000]   the data wars
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   this takes place roughly between
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   2017 and
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.320]   2020 this is when researchers began to seriously try to gather or study the data to get a stronger more data-driven
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.920]   Conclusion on this question of a smartphone somehow involved in these increases in anxiety that we're seeing
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.940]   This was a period of both proposals and critiques, which is good
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:52.520]   This is how new sciences emerge, especially in social psychology, which is by definition a complicated field
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.360]   That rarely has super strong signals
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.040]   There was proposals and critiques or responses to the critiques. And so that's why I call this the data wars
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.480]   This was the period in which almost any New York Times article on this issue would say with big caveats
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.720]   There is some data, but it's it's contested. It's because this data war period is when the science was actually happening
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.620]   Let me talk about two troubling streams of data that came out of this period the critiques and the responses to the critiques
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:23.280]   So the first bit of troubling evidence that emerged as we got more serious about this question was simply the timing
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.040]   that
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.320]   2012
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.120]   that was a
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.600]   Really? It's a circumstantial evidence, but a really strong pointer towards smartphones at play and here's why
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:42.260]   There's lots of different reasons you could come up for come up with for why young people between 2012 and 2020
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:48.960]   We're becoming more anxious the world felt like an anxious place. We had the financial crisis
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:56.880]   We had the financial insecurity that that caused we had the extreme partisanship and unrest that followed in the in the Trump era
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.780]   And so it did seem like a period of lots that were going on. The problem is none of this fit 2012 in particular
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:10.940]   The financial crisis was 2006 to 2009. The financial insecurity was felt strongly by the millennial generation
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.120]   We were entering the job force then not Gen Z. By the time Gen Z was entering a job force
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.160]   That was largely in the rearview mirror
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:25.320]   There was a lot of political partisanship and unrest that that arose later in the 2010s, but that was after 2012
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.240]   2012 was the Barack Obama Mitt Romney election
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.600]   There was not an increase in partisanship there as compared to let's say even just a 2008 election in which we had Sarah Palin involved
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.000]   in that movement
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.400]   Compared to the contract with for America Newt Gingrich in the Clinton era that type of partisanship
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.040]   There wasn't something new that happened in 2012 that wasn't also there in 2009 wasn't also there in 1999
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.940]   The populist revolutions of Trump etc. That didn't really pick up speed until 15 or 16, right?
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.400]   So that explanation doesn't quite fit it
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:06.200]   Also as we got more data, we saw these anxiety rises among young people happening in many many countries
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   So we could not pin this on particular
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.800]   American
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.320]   Dynamics. So what did fit this? Well, here's Jean. Let me just show a couple graphs here
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.440]   These are just a couple other graphs that are showing 2012 being a big deal
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:28.000]   So we see female especially with female reports of sadness and hopelessness
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.800]   between 2011 and
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.760]   2021 we see a significant increase from 36% to 57%
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.640]   I'm also showing US teens with major depression, especially with girls. We see a hundred forty five percent increase as we move from
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.560]   2012 to 2020. So these are just examples of lots of things were
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.520]   pivoting on 2012
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.400]   Here's Jean Twenge
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.280]   She said okay, what does match 2012?
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.560]   It was exactly the moment when the proportion of Americans who owned a smartphone suppressed 50%
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.360]   That's what's changed in
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.240]   after that point
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.080]   You were much more likely as an adolescent to have a smartphone before that point. It was much less likely
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.720]   None of these other potentially anxiety producing trends match that date nearly as well
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.760]   All right. So this was the first bit of troubling evidence to emerge right is it's circumstantial and there's critiques
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.360]   I would say one of the big critiques I'm showing this on the screen an example now was this idea that no no
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.400]   We agree with you that there's not world events or cultural events that match the 2012 outside of smartphones
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.960]   But the thing that really changed in 2012 was not smartphones
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.640]   This critique says it was that this new generation was coming of age and they're more comfortable
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:47.560]   Talking about mental health. They're like that. So this was a big critique in the early part of the data wars
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.960]   You see rises in depression anxiety
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.680]   Because more people are willing to say I'm anxious or I have depression
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:00.920]   This quote from the New York Times of 2018 is sort of typical of this period. Here's Richard Friedman writing the Times
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.360]   He says look there are a few surveys reporting increased anxiety in adolescents
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.000]   But there's self-reported measures from kids or their parents and they're over
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.300]   Estimating rates of discords because they're detecting mild symptoms not clinically significant syndromes
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:20.220]   This was claimed a lot during the early period of the data wars. So as good science does it said well, how can we?
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.400]   Look into this
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.960]   Counter hypothesis and the right way to look into this counter hypothesis is to say let's find
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.480]   Stronger proxies for anxiety that have nothing to do with self-reporting
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.640]   And in particular I put two charts on the screen here and these are both tragic
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.160]   But they also give us deep insight. The first chart is US teens admitted to hospitals
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.800]   for non-fatal self-harm
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.320]   ages 10 to 14
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.640]   This gets around the self-reporting process. These are people who tried to harm themselves due to anxiety and these are from hospital records
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.560]   Look at girls
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:02.580]   188 percent increase between 2010 to 2020 with the increase getting particularly stark
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.480]   around
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.880]   2012
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   Even more tragically we look to the right we see
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.560]   suicides among US teens
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.040]   2012 jumps up
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.680]   134 percent increase among girls starting around that
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.160]   2012 point
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.880]   So it was a reasonable hypothesis that well, maybe
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.240]   Around 2012. We just got more comfortable talking about anxiety. We were just picking up mild self-reported symptoms
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:37.000]   Unfortunately, the hospital records show these indications rose at the exact same rate. So there really was an increase here kids are and
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.280]   Starting around this period having worse mental health
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.000]   The second strand of troubling evidence was to correlational studies
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.600]   so social psychologists often will work with these giant data sets these giant data sets where researchers will go out and talk to tens of
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.760]   thousands of people and ask them about everything and
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.400]   Then after the fact you can come back as a researcher and look for all sorts of connections within this data
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.280]   if you want to know if
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.480]   People who like the color red is their favorite color or more likely to have had
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:14.600]   Back surgery in the last six months. You can just go and look at this data and find those things and look for correlations, etc
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   So they did this they said let's start looking at this data
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.080]   We'll look at young people and we'll look at correlations between these
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.880]   Technologies and negative outcomes and they began to find lots of strong connections
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.360]   Here's just one of many many graphs that were produced in this period
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.880]   This particularly one looked at UK adolescents with clinically relevant depressive symptoms
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.160]   the x-axis is
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.060]   number of hours per weekday on social media
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.880]   the y-axis is percentage of teens who used that much social media that were
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:51.240]   Diagnosed as depressed and as you see when you increase from no time on social media to five plus hours
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.720]   You get a significant increase in percentage of teens that are depressed
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.400]   this is particularly high for girls where you go from a
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:10.640]   7% depression rate for girls who don't use social media to almost a 40% depression rate for girls who use four to five hours of
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.960]   social media
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   All right, so we saw a lot of studies of this type
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.040]   this generated critiques
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.760]   So other researchers came along and said yeah, you're finding these correlations, but you know
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.120]   You could it's easy to find correlations between things the effect sizes are small
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.840]   and perhaps the most famous of these papers was published in
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:37.040]   2019 by Przbylski and Amy Orbin. This is known by researchers in the field colloquially as the potato
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.240]   Study they went in and looked at one of these big data sets and said and I'll read them here
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.200]   The connection is negative, but teeny
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.840]   Indicating a level of harmfulness so close to zero
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:55.520]   That it is roughly the same size as they find for the association of mental health with eating potatoes or wearing eyeglasses
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.640]   So they said look we looked and found these these yet you use more digital technology
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   You're less happy, but the effect is the same we found for
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:10.560]   Eating potatoes on your happiness or wearing eyeglasses on your happiness their point being these are so small that they're basically arbitrary
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.540]   You're finding artifacts in the data this article the potato article was cited a lot
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.320]   Even until very recently you would see major
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.600]   Newspapers like the New York Times often saying because this was very influential
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:32.160]   You know studies show a potential connection between these technologies and negative mental health, but the effects are small
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.800]   This is the type of paper that caused that
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.740]   So as good science does we looked at this now? Here's a response to the potato paper
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.160]   co-authored by Gene Twenge and John Haidt
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.480]   It was published in nature human behavior, and it was called
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:57.000]   Overestimating digital media harm in this article height looked at Przbylski and Orban and said well wait a second
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.500]   Wait a second, and I'm gonna read his words here the first issue to note is that the potatoes comparison?
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.440]   Was what they reported for all digital media use?
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:15.720]   Not for social media use specifically digital media includes all screen based activities including watching TV or Netflix videos with a sibling
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:21.000]   Which are not harmful activities in their own published report when you zoom in on social media
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.080]   Only the relationship is between two and six times larger than for digital media
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:34.680]   Also crucial is that Orban and Przbylski loop lump together all teens boys and girls while many studies have found that the correlations
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:41.220]   With harm are larger for girls so height is saying it's almost like you're intentionally trying to reduce
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.880]   the negative impact
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:51.280]   You're only showing the connection between all possible digital media use and negative social harms even though your data set you were using had
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.680]   Social media broken out and all the discussion has been about social media and in height and 20 said so we looked at your same
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   Data set and just looked at social media
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.640]   And you had a much much bigger
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.200]   Response a response that especially if you break out girls was six times worse than eating potatoes a very significant response
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.040]   So I say here on the slide
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.520]   this is John Haidt being polite because
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.680]   When you really read this critique you're wondering
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.480]   How is there any other explanation for the potato paper other than a set of researchers who are saying?
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.700]   We want to report. There's not really a difference here. It's otherwise hard to explain why they would
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:34.360]   Choose what they chose and not talk about these other aspects to their paper if they were really just trying to understand is there harm
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   here
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.100]   All right, so let's get to the third act of this story this research story on smartphones and kids
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:48.360]   I call this third act a consensus begins to emerge this covers the period of 2020 to 2023 so until today
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.520]   essentially what has happened in the past two or three years is
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:59.640]   The critiques have largely fallen away and a consensus is emerging in the field that yes, especially for girls
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.400]   There is a strong negative connection between these technologies and mental health
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.800]   The reason why this consensus emerges first of all the critiques as we talked about before the main critiques during the data war
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.060]   Were pretty thoroughly debunked, you know after the potato paper
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.440]   It's not like there was a lot of more stronger papers
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.980]   It said really made a strong case that there wasn't a strong connection there and the timing argument really seems to have been one for
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.320]   The people who are worried about smartphones so that happened
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.760]   But then what we began to get and this is how a lot of emerging literatures begin to coalesce around a consensus
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   We began to get multiple other
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.380]   Independent sources of investigation that pointed towards the same conclusion
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.080]   When you have multiple different types of threads that all begin to weave around the same answer
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:49.440]   That's often what happens in complex literatures that points it towards a conclusion and that really began to happen in the last couple of years
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.300]   So one of the threads it was natural experiments. Here's a cool paper written by an economist Elaine Gu and
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.560]   She looked at in Canada
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.800]   I believe the arrival of high-speed wireless internet in a given province from town to town
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.560]   when high-speed wireless internet arrived
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.480]   Heavy social media use became possible. Then you could have a smartphone and you could use it on the app
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.440]   And so she looked at if we have nearby towns
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.640]   demographically and culturally very similar
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.760]   But we end up in this natural experiment situation where one town gets wireless high-speed internet between before the other
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.560]   Can we compare what's happening with teenage mental health in these two towns and see if there's a change?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   Yes, there was
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.400]   Girl teen girl severe mental health diagnoses increased by 90%
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.880]   When the wireless internet arrived so it was a nice natural experiment
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.720]   We also had some direct randomized control trials experiments. Here's a good paper by Melissa Hunt et al
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.040]   They just took 143 undergraduates and randomly
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   Assigned them to either stop using social media or keep using it as normal. So it's a randomized
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.840]   Perspective control trial. What did they find the group that was told to limit their social media use showed significant
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.960]   reductions in loneliness and depression as
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.840]   compared to the control groups
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.760]   So that's interesting. I
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.240]   Think maybe one of the strongest
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.820]   Forces and helping a consensus come together was self-reporting
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.120]   Just talking to teenagers themselves
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.040]   So when Francis Hagan leaked all of those data from meta a couple years ago
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.440]   What was known as the Facebook files as what the Wall Street Journal called it one of the big interesting?
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.120]   findings in these leaked documents from meta was the fact that they had done survey on teens and
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.680]   Had found that I'm quoting here
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.240]   Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.840]   This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups. So the teenagers themselves are saying yeah
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.160]   This is why we're more anxious and depressed this app these phones
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:02.520]   Other data begin to find the same thing. I put on the slide a put on put up here a slide from research out of
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.640]   Australia these are Australian teens
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.760]   By far the number one reason they give for why they think youth mental health is getting worse is social media. I
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.360]   Think this was the final smoking gun is the teens themselves are saying this is hurting me
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.360]   This is causing a problem. It is really hard to be a potato study style skeptic in the face of the teens themselves saying
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.320]   Yes, this is causing me harm. We're not teasing out
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.200]   subtle epidemiological effects a
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:36.400]   slight increase in the background cancer rate for the towns that were using a different type of pipe in their water where the individuals themselves
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.280]   Have no way of detecting this change. This is not that this is a huge
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.200]   loud
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:49.920]   Self-observable macro signal this thing is making me uncomfortable that ultimately is the big difference between this and past moral
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.600]   panics around youths and technologies
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.760]   When my grandparents let's say they were upset that my mom was listening to the Beatles in the late
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.840]   1960s if they went to my mom and said stop listening to those Beatles
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.520]   It's going to warp your mind. My mom would have said, you know, get out of here
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.760]   What she would not have said is I agree
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.800]   These records are making me and my friends incredibly anxious. I wish I didn't have to listen to them
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.320]   That would have been a very different situation
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.040]   So this is why I think this analogy to past concerns about youth technology
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.080]   Really begins to fall apart data aside the teens tell you yeah, I know this is making me anxious
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   I don't like that. I have to be on it
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.160]   So, why does it do this
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.980]   So let's look in particular at social media first and then we'll broaden out the smartphones
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.760]   Why do researchers think social media is causing these negative?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.440]   Impacts on mental health. There's a few reasons to come up. One is loneliness
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:48.800]   Now readers of my book digital minimalism. This will sound familiar because I talk about this in digital minimalism
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:56.440]   It's paradoxical at first but using these social technologies more will actually lead you to feel less social
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:04.880]   And what's going on here is young people replace in-person interaction with texting and social media back and forth
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.760]   but this purely linguistic communication just sending text back and forth to each other or
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.120]   commenting on each other's post is
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.720]   Not interpreted by the social circuits of our brain as being all that social
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.640]   There's no voice modulation. There's no body language. You're not in the presence of another person in the same room
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.560]   So you're in your room as a 14 year old all day on text messages and you tell yourself wow
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.600]   I'm so social because all I've been doing is talking to people but as far as your brain is concerned
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.880]   You're incredibly lonely because you haven't seen anyone all day
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.600]   and
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   Social psychologists call this social snacking
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.320]   Lightweight easy digital socialization we do that instead of having the real meal and we end up more lonely
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.480]   We see this in the data. I have two charts up on the screen now
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.520]   One shows loneliness among teenagers and you see again 2012
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:59.500]   Goes right up. The other chart says shows daily average time spent with friends
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.140]   Starting in 2012 for the ages 15 and 24
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   Go straight down
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.960]   more time on the phone
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.280]   Meant less time interacting in person meant loneliness went up
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.800]   There's an interesting observation by the way that John height makes this got underway around
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.480]   2012 and it was so pronounced by the time the pandemic came along the change wasn't even that big
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.320]   And we can see this on this chart
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.600]   I mean certainly we can we continue to have a steep we have a steep fall from 2000 in 2020
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.760]   But we were having a steep fall from 2018 to 19 as well. So he pointed this out in a newsletter article
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.600]   He wrote earlier this spring
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:46.040]   these effects of isolation were already so pronounced because of smartphones among American teens that the difference of adding a
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.400]   Isolation through lockdowns actually didn't even make that big of a difference. We were already on that trajectory
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   Another issue here is performativity
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.080]   Especially with social media, especially with girls. Let me read something here from Jean Twenge
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   Girls use social media more often
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:09.000]   Giving them additional opportunities to feel excluded and lonely when they see their friends or classmates getting together without them
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.720]   Social media levy a psychic tax on the teen doing the posting as well as she anxiously awaits the affirmation of comments and likes
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:24.520]   So you're constantly worried about what other people are doing and how people are perceiving you combine that with a teenage brain
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.600]   Come on, no way. That's gonna be positive
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.860]   The final thing I want to mention here is the amplification of harmful behaviors
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:37.640]   Online communities for all their good also have the dark side of it allows especially vulnerable
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:43.880]   Teenagers who are trying to find themselves and are open to suggestions and are feeling vulnerable and full of all these different chemicals
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.440]   It's very easy to get caught in on line communities that will then amplify
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:55.120]   Harmful behaviors that will directly reduce your mental health and a lot of cases also your physical health
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.640]   We're beginning to see more lawsuits along these lines
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.000]   I have a headline up here right now about a family suing meta because they blame Instagram
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.560]   for encouraging their daughters eating disorder and
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   Self-harm, there's all sorts of cases like this. So this is another source of this connection between reduced mental health and
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.800]   Social media use is there's a lot of traps on there
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.440]   You end up in a community that is cheering on something that in the end is going to make you feel much worse
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.760]   All right
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   Social media is not the whole story a
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.840]   Lot of this data is looking at social media. Some of it's looking at smartphones in general
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.960]   I want to just briefly mention that even if you aren't using social media on a smartphone if you're a teenager
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   There's other harms we know are there
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.880]   Impeded thinking skills is critical. I talked about this in a somewhat recent
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.440]   episode of the podcast
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.560]   It's talking about Marianne Wolfe's work on
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.500]   the development of young minds when they spend more times on screens the short version of this is
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   deep critical thinking skills
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   require training
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.760]   Training requires things like reading analog books that you struggle with you can take time to pause and make sense of what you just read before
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.200]   moving on training requires
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.920]   Self-reflection the ability to hold thoughts and your working memories and work on it having that time alone and that familiarity with it
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.680]   Smartphones get in the way of that training
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.520]   Because it teaches your brain to instead move very quick
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:29.200]   Look like a L-shaped skim for things that are going to give you in text a quick hit of dopamine or excitement
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.360]   flee boredom if you have any moments of downtime have a
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.240]   Something right on your screen. I was watching
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.920]   Jesse I was watching this on the flight
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.240]   There's not my flight to San Francisco is my flight to Utah a few weeks ago
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.200]   Maybe like a 20 year old guy sitting a row up in the aisle. I was watching him use tik-tok. I
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.080]   Mean it was crazy. It's like cuz he had his phone out. They'll just be like some weird video
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.980]   He was watching on average six seconds and he swiped and another video would come up and he was swiping another video would come up
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.720]   That's just all he was doing the whole time. Well, I don't know the whole time before a while
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.800]   Yeah, I was watching over his shoulder
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.100]   man, glad I'm reading my
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:15.600]   Ellen Lightman book about transcendentalism and the human brain made me feel good. But you know, the point is is it's so
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.280]   Rewarding the moment that you don't do the activities that would otherwise give you critical thinking skills
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.240]   And so you're just not good at thinking deeply and that's a huge
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:31.160]   Harm sleep deprivation is a big deal for teenagers and these smartphones. Look you give a 13 year old boy a smartphone
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   They're gonna YouTube until 4 in the morning
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.880]   When I gave this talk someone in the audience said there's a lot of middle schoolers there and one of the middle schoolers was talking
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.900]   About how all of her friends who have these smartphones are on them all night and then they come in the class
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:50.720]   They're completely tired. They can't function. They're doing really poorly on their on their tests, but they can't help themselves because if you have this
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.840]   It's hard to turn it off. So teenagers are having a huge sleep deprivation issue. It's a
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.680]   YouTube video games and social media scrolling
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.760]   Solitude deprivation is another issue. I talked about this in digital minimalism as well
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.040]   Our mind is not meant to constantly be processing information generated by another mind
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.980]   We need time alone with our own thoughts to recharge and that makes sense of our world
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:21.660]   Smartphones can eliminate that entirely from your existence because any moment where before you might have just been alone with your own thoughts
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.840]   You can now pull out the thing
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.200]   Over time that makes us anxious. It also harms self-development at an age where we need it
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.660]   14 you're trying to figure yourself out. You're 15. You're trying to figure yourself out. You need time alone with your own thoughts
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.080]   Your brain needs it
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.180]   And finally we have this issue that smartphones in general minimize quality leisure
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.060]   So the thing you're doing on the phone gets in the way of the things you should be doing
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:50.640]   It gets in way of the things that's going to be more meaningful or quality or sustainable or connect you more to your friends or
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.860]   Your community or build skills or give you confidence. It's easier just to look at the phone and
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.720]   to watch twitch and
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.660]   So it gets in the way of something that could be better
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.940]   This is often missed when we think about smartphones and teens will hone in on the exact activity
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:11.160]   And say well my son isn't on social media. He's not doing performativity doesn't have to worry about online bullying
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.460]   He's the thing he's looking at is really harmless
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.160]   In fact, maybe there's like some science content in it
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.580]   The issue there is not that what he's looking at is a problem is that because he's looking at all day
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.580]   He's not doing the things to be good
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.880]   so we've got harms with
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:30.780]   Unrestricted smartphone access for young people that go beyond just the specific stuff that social media can do
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.180]   All right, so where is this all headed at the national scale it's an interesting question
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.540]   Is there going to be some sort of legislative shift?
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:46.640]   That's going to come out of this data. Now that the consensus has emerged. It's clear that this consensus has been
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.540]   Understood and intaked by
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.340]   Legislative bodies and policymakers. I think it's now accepted that
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:34:01.200]   unrestricted smartphone use especially for prepubescent kids, especially for prepubescent girls is very
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.780]   Dangerous, I think this has all been accepted now. So where's this gonna head? I'm not quite sure
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.620]   But here's one thing I would keep an eye on
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.920]   Here's the surgeon general earlier this year
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.120]   He said wait until your kids are 16 to let them use social media
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:25.000]   This conclusion I think is something that a lot of researchers are coming to I talked to John Hyde about this and he agreed with
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.180]   That as well if you've made it through puberty
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:34.000]   The development as an individual as well as the social development and everything that happens during that period if you've made it through all of that
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.800]   Before you then get unrestricted access to the internet and social media
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.120]   You're in a much better position to succeed
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.680]   Because you know who you are who your friends are what you're interested in what you're about. You've done all that work
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:52.880]   And now if you get exposed to this it's gonna have a much less negative impact than if you get it at 12
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.120]   Or you get it at 13
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.680]   So if you can wait till 16 this seems to be an emerging consensus
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.280]   This might possibly be made in the legislation
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:07.140]   One of the relevant things to keep an eye on here is the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.760]   this act implicitly already in codes 13 as
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.780]   The minimum age that you can sign up for a social media service
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.840]   Now, of course these social media services didn't exist in 1998
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:26.460]   The actual wording here is 13 is the minimum age at which you can consent to give up your data privacy, which of course
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:34.280]   You do when you sign up for an attention economy platform like social media. The original version of this act had 16 in there
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:41.420]   Tech lobbyist in DC got that pushed down to 13. There's calls now to amend it back to 16
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:47.680]   So that could happen. There's other legislative avenues that are being pursued. It's tricky
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.640]   But this is one to keep an eye on what would happen if that law was changed. It's not that this would make it
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:02.800]   Really hard for individual young people to get access to social media, right? It's not super enforceable. But what it would give is
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.160]   a
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:11.300]   metaphorical chair to parents that are trying to tame this metaphorical lion when you have your 13 year old again and again saying all my
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.560]   Friends have this I want this. Why can't I have it all my friends have this I want it
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.320]   Why can't I have it for the parent to be able to say because it's illegal is a very strong defense and
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.880]   You're not putting your these parents in the situation of having to be social psychology researchers and understand this literature
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   They can say it's against the law. I'm not gonna break the law
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.240]   You'll just have to learn not to have those friends, I guess, you know, I mean, it's it's gonna be it would be helpful
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.600]   So something like that may happen
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.800]   Now, where do I what do I conclude from all of this? I mean to me I
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.100]   Would say that 16 age limit is a smart one
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.580]   I
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.940]   Think this is good. I think the data is pointing towards your safest bet especially if we're talking about young girls is
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.580]   16 is the age
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.540]   Below which you do not want to give a child
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.740]   unrestricted access to the Internet
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:06.220]   If you give a young person a smartphone you are giving them unrestricted access to the Internet. You can do some parental controls
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.540]   They'll get around them. They're better at it than you. This is the thing about kids, right?
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:18.300]   Like if we ever went to war cyber war with China and we needed in a sort of enders game
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.100]   Style brilliant kids that like help save us. Here's how we would win the cyber hacking war
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:30.180]   Just tell a bunch of 13 year olds that if you bring down China's whatever infrastructure you will get unlimited access to mr
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.680]   beast videos because these kids become
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.740]   Dennis Nidry style hackers when it comes to trying to get access
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.460]   To these things the same kids that can't even
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:48.100]   Motivate themselves to take the garbage out if they think they can access YouTube on their school's Chromebook. They're in there a soldering irons, you know
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:48.620]   All right
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:56.140]   I'm bypassing the main CPU logic here and I'm hacking the main security grid by getting right to the opcode lookup table in the ROM
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.620]   they become
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:04.360]   Expert computer hackers if there's a video game they can access or snapchat lays just beyond those protections
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.940]   So you give a smartphone to a kid you're giving an unrestricted Internet access
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.460]   You can money restrict to Internet access. They can use social media
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.500]   Even the definition of social media is getting a little bit hazy now a lot of the actual performance
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.360]   Socialization has shifted from social media on to group text messages
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:23.820]   So it gets a little bit it gets a little bit hazy and we have all these other harms that surround the smartphones the sleep
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.700]   deprivation the solitude deprivation so it really seems like
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.580]   16 is the safe time to say okay, you can just have a phone and I'm not gonna
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.420]   Care too much what you're doing anymore
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.660]   Does that mean that's the only age where you can have any type of device like this?
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.940]   well, can I actually ask John Hyde about this as well and and his thought was
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.820]   When you functionally need a phone
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.980]   Okay, because I don't know
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.260]   I'm commuting the school on the city buses like a lot of kids do at my kids school and
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.700]   You need an ability to maybe text your parents if there's an emergency or call your parents if you know
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.820]   The bus routes cancel or something like that when they functionally need a phone you can get them a phone that doesn't have Internet
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.100]   So when you get to an age where I'm independent enough
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:11.740]   That having communication ability with me is going to enable this independence then get them some sort of communication device, but one without Internet
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.700]   16 is what you can give them a smartphone has everything that seems to be the emerging consensus
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.340]   I think five to ten years from now that will just be accepted
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.220]   If you have if your oldest you have a child right now and your oldest child is two
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.940]   You're not going to have to think about this when they become 12 the cultural have shifted
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.100]   You won't be giving an iPhone to your 12 12 year old that will just be accepted
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   We're right now in this
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:41.460]   Intermediate transition period where parents still have to make these decisions on their own as far as I can tell that's my best read of the literature
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.820]   When it becomes they're independent enough the function of communication give them a phone like a light phone
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:51.620]   Which looks great and can text well, but has no internet wait till 16 to give them unrestricted access
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.180]   So you can't have your own iPad or your own smartphone till you're 16
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.740]   They will yell and gnash their teeth
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.660]   But come on
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:02.860]   Everything in the history of the world that teenagers have wanted that their parents don't want the teenagers have said all my friends are doing
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.060]   It you have to give it to me. This is not necessarily different. So I think that's where we're heading
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.580]   Obviously, there's lots of caveats here. Some kids have a much easier experience with these technologies than others
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.940]   Parents clearly know their own kids
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:21.580]   There is the one thing I'll also point out is I've heard before when I've when I've been on the road or talked about
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.580]   my book is
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.460]   often sort of
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:32.140]   Socially elite people have this storyline that less socially elite or less economically elite people
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:36.540]   Need the need these technologies and it's somehow
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.900]   Classist the talk about this that somehow
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.720]   Having a 14 year old not use a smartphone is it's like a yoga thing
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.380]   It's like a luxury thing and I can say having worked with lots of different groups from lots of different
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:52.020]   Backgrounds on this issue. They would say nonsense to that
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:59.100]   Everyone is worried about the kids with this kids are worried about this in all sorts of different backgrounds all sorts of different economic classes
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.300]   So I don't think this is a yoga issue. This is like a teen smoking issue
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.980]   No teen should smoke. So we said you should wait till you're 18 to do it
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:13.300]   I think it's closer to that than it is to it would be nice to do meditation if you have the time for it
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.420]   So we'll see
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:20.860]   But Jesse that's that seems to be where the data is right now and it looks like policymakers are trying to get behind that
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.820]   So we're getting close to a point where parents aren't gonna have to figure this all out on their own anymore
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.440]   There'll be some more of these consensus ease, but I think that like you're 12. Here's your smartphone
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.980]   Give us another five years. That's gonna be considered something. Oh, wow. Don't do that. So will they still go on?
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:40.820]   Social media on their desktop. Well, yeah, but desktops are controlled
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.860]   Here's the family laptop you use it in the kitchen. I can see what you're doing
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:50.420]   Much different situation. I mean, there's a lot of great stuff to do on the Internet, but doing it through the family laptop
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.260]   You know, we know we know a kid who's really into
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.220]   sports and
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.740]   So their family got him a subscription to the athletic like this is great
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.860]   Like if I was really in the sports and I was 13
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:06.380]   To be able to one of the activities I was able to do was like to go on the family computer and get super in-depth
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.340]   Sports coverage. That's great
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.620]   It's feeding an interest that the kid really has and another kid is really in the chess and they can do you know
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:16.700]   These chess games online all that's great. But if all that's done through the family computer, it's like watching TV
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.820]   You can't watch TV all the time
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.500]   Right, the parents say no TV now TV's in the living room
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.100]   They're in charge of it, but you're gonna watch a fair amount of TV and it's nice and like that's what the Internet should be
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.380]   For a 13 year old there's all these cool things on here
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.780]   That you can do just like there's cool TV shows you could watch but you can do them
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.300]   During times when it's appropriate on a machine where we kind of see what's going on. Yep
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.420]   And even if they have school-issued laptops that like some of the private schools around here
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:45.420]   There's probably some controls on that as well. Yeah, they all get around them. Yeah, they all get around them. Yeah, that's cool. It's funny
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.580]   we had a
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.980]   Six one of the neighbors who's always over one of the neighbors is I think?
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.860]   seven, maybe eight
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.980]   hacked into YouTube on the Chromebook
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.020]   I'm telling you these kids
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:04.580]   That'll like stare at you for an hour if you ask him to do a fraction
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.540]   If they could get access to YouTube
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:16.460]   They are you know building a quantum processor to break the encryption, you know based on whatever like good news
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.420]   I have a hundred eight twenty eight qubit quantum processor. I
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:27.140]   Packed together in the playground and we're able to break the public key encryption that was keeping us out of
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.660]   Mark Rober videos they become hackers
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:39.380]   Anyways, alright, so that's that's some thoughts that's where I think the research lies right now. I think that's where we're roughly heading
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:44.420]   All right. So Jesse what I want to do is we're gonna move on to some questions. I
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:51.500]   Found questions that roughly orbit this I don't want to do all questions about kids and smartphones. So and so instead I I
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.900]   increased the
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.060]   Topic that I felt this show was covering and we're gonna talk in general about
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.980]   distractions and technologies and dealing with distractions and the quest to build a deep life
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.180]   So we'll be a little bit more general and then at the end of the show, we'll do books
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:11.060]   Books I read in March. We never did that because I was traveling and technically we're still recording this episode in April
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.260]   Even though it's coming out in May. So I don't know I feel like
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.840]   It counts so into the show. We'll get to the five books. I read in March
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:25.140]   first however, I want to talk about a sponsor that makes this show possible and that is
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.060]   Grammarly go
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:36.460]   Now this is a very interesting new product offering from our good friends at Grammarly Grammarly
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.140]   So ironic I can't I'm struggling to say Grammarly
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.020]   Grammarly
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.140]   I've been saying this for two years now
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:50.120]   For some reason my grammar is wrong on Grammarly Grammarly go is very
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.940]   Interesting because what's working on here? Is that it uses?
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.620]   generative AI
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:02.500]   To help improve the writing you're already doing in the apps in which you already write now for people who are heard my
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.320]   podcast episode recently on these technologies on
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:14.240]   GPT in particular know that I'm not a big believer in the storylines that somehow these technologies have
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.660]   Changed the entire world and they're
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:24.020]   Intelligent or they're they're going to right away get rid of all jobs what I argued in those past episodes is know what these technologies
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   are really good at is
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.220]   taking in text and
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.460]   Producing new text based on your intentions or things you want
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:37.100]   So this Grammarly go is a perfect case study of exactly where?
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.100]   generative technology AI technology based on large language models is
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:46.540]   Really well suited. So here's the type of stuff you can do with Grammarly go
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:50.080]   So you're writing in whatever app you would you know, you would write an email
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:55.340]   you're writing in a word processor document wherever and you have Grammarly go sitting there like a
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.260]   Assistant who can help you with your writing
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.680]   So one of the things you could do for example is say and these are real examples
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:10.160]   Outline ideas on how to decorate a taco truck. Give me ten possible captions for this post
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:16.140]   You can actually ask for sample text that the assistant will generate for you and you can then look at and integrate into what you are
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.980]   Working on you can also have the assistant Grammarly go help you
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.820]   Improve your writing. So maybe you write something and then say hey, can you make this sound more exciting?
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:34.100]   Can you make this sound more professional? Can you make this sound more inspirational? This is the sweet spot of generative AI
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.980]   This is what it can do
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:44.020]   So well that it spins your head and so kudos to Grammarly to integrate this into their into their product line where it makes
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.340]   so much sense
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.300]   So you can not only produce stuff you can work into your writing
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.220]   It's also a way to just improve the sound or the tone of your writing
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.860]   it's kind of a cool step forward and
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:04.020]   It's this is again. This is where I think generative AI is going to have its impact in these targeted applications the things we do every day
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:08.900]   Especially text based things we do every day and it's going to be like that assistant sitting there looking over your shoulder
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.260]   Giving you that helping hand
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:18.700]   It's a really cool really cool product. So you'll be amazed at what you can do with Grammarly go go to Grammarly.com/go

[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.060]   dot-com
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.540]   Go also want to talk about our old friends at
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.700]   Blinkist
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:40.660]   Blinkist is a subscription service that gives you short summaries that you can either read or listen to they take about 15 minutes to read
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.660]   or listen to of over
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.500]   5,500 non-fiction books
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:52.420]   Now what I like about Blinkist is that it gives you an ability to triage your reading life
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:58.540]   We're a big believer here on the deep questions podcast that reading is critical. It's how you engage ideas
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.620]   It's how you increase your understanding of the world is how you get smarter
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:06.580]   The question is how do you figure out what books to read what Jesse and I do is we use Blinkist?
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:11.660]   We hear about a book. We'll add it to a list. We want to buy a new book
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.640]   We'll take books off those lists and we will listen to or read the blinks for that book
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.660]   By getting the main ideas in just 15 minutes. You can assess pretty quickly
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:25.420]   Do I want to buy or read this whole book or do I really need do I know what I need to know at this?
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.540]   Point it really helps you decide which books are gonna make the big impact and which books you're okay
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.660]   Just getting the summary from there's a lot of ways to use Blinkist
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:38.300]   But that's the way we like to use it as our sidekick for helping to support
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.860]   the reading life
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:46.780]   They also have ways to help you discover books. I'd like the they have collections were themed collections of books
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.260]   Hey read all these blinks and see which ones you want to buy. It's a cool tool
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.540]   They have a new feature that I want to talk about too called Blinkist Connect

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:39.120]   All right, Jesse I think it's time to get to some questions what do we got first
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.180]   All right, first questions from Jeremy since I recently became a father
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.940]   I find myself procrastinating on work and even at the office
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:52.820]   I could spend all day on reddit looking for that one stimulus so my brain could be satisfied same for books
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:57.060]   I read more books since I've been listening to your show, but always feels like there's something missing
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:03.520]   Living in living a more deeper simple life seems to be a bit dull and I can't shake that feeling
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.020]   Well, Jeremy have a couple things to say here
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.340]   One is there is a transient period
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.940]   transient duration
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:19.580]   To what you're feeling. This is a common effect. I felt this as well when you become a new father
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:24.580]   It's a there's a weird combination of things that happen. So one of course you're tired
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:32.200]   More tired than normal more exhausted normal because you're helping to care for a newborn. You also feel there's this
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.940]   sudden reduction of
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:39.540]   Activity stuff you might have otherwise done now. You're not gonna you're at your home
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:44.740]   You're kind of helping to take care of the kid. But what happens often when the kid is really young is so you're home
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:50.820]   But the kid is just napping or the kid is just feeding and there is this sense of a sudden reduction in activity
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:57.580]   I remember feeling this after our first was born the sense of I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm here
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:02.060]   the baby and my wife are napping I'm like sort of not doing other things and I
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.180]   Feel just like you're saying here
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.620]   It's like things are dull or a little gray or there's just like a
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:16.860]   Cap your affect is cap because you don't have those things going on that that maybe give you hits of anticipation or excitement
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:20.660]   That's transient and it goes away. The kid gets a little bit bigger you fall back into a routine
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.700]   If you have later kids, you don't feel that anymore because then it's just chaos
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:30.260]   So when you have future kids, you're just taking care of the older kids and you're way too busy to worry about this
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   So it's really a first kid
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.780]   Phenomenon and it does go away. I always used to think it takes about four months before
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:42.740]   You feel like a routine has returned after having a kid and I be I learned over the many kids
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.980]   I've we've had over the years is just to treat that first four months differently
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.500]   Like this is like an all-hands-on-deck
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.260]   Unusual period don't extrapolate from this
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:57.660]   to the rest of your life don't extrapolate from the lack of sleep to the rest of your life don't extrapolate from the the
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.340]   Reduction and aspirational our professional activities for the rest of your life
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:07.500]   It's four months and usually after four months you fall back into a routine and then you you're mentally freed up
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.940]   So that's one part of it
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.940]   the other part of it is
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.500]   Your vision of the deep life might be too dull
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.700]   right, I mean if you're
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.980]   You if you're the way you've structured your life is you feel like this is just dull. I don't know
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.100]   I'm just I read books sometimes and nothing's exciting to me
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.940]   Construct a lifestyle vision that's more exciting
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.980]   I mean this is how VBL CCP values based lifestyle center career planning works
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:39.900]   You start with this vision of a lifestyle that resonates with you and for you. It sounds like this will be a lifestyle vision
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:45.820]   That has some definition of excitement. I don't know what that means. It could be excitement. It might have to do with
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:53.980]   Non-professional projects or activities or hobbies or skills that you're trying to build it might be excitement in terms of a
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:56.820]   radical move to a new location
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:01.580]   That's very intentional about where you're going to be raising your kid and what your day-to-day life is going to be like you're in
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:07.980]   A cabin somewhere as opposed to an apartment in Northern, Virginia, or it could be a professional vision changing your job going out on your own
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.700]   shifting over to a
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.980]   Combination freelance whatever but if that excitement is something that resonates with you
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:19.160]   You need a vision that resonates that vision should include that excitement and then you start working backwards
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.480]   What are the moves I can begin making given the capital I have right now
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.660]   Career and otherwise that move me closer to that vision and now you have something you're looking at now
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:33.080]   You're making progress and now you're moving towards something that's going to resonate more. So we have the transient effect
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:38.080]   It's going to be four months your new father don't extrapolate from these four months any aspects of your life
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.580]   Don't extrapolate to what your life is going to be like, but as you leave that phase
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.340]   If you feel like your life is dull
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:49.460]   You're living the wrong vision. It's not your vision. It's a different vision. So build one that's more exciting
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.820]   All
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.620]   Right, who do we got next?
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.860]   Next question is from Jeff in the absence of having a known activity to do next
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.220]   I often get trapped doom scrolling in some way or the other for example
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:08.540]   If they're shutting down from work or having experienced a poor night's sleep. I'm too tired to focus on reading. So I end up scrolling reddit
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:15.820]   Well Jeff what we need to do here is work on your cognitive wiring right now
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   Your cognitive wiring has learned
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.580]   Looking at this screen
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.960]   Seeing reddit comments gives me this little bit of hit of something and that's what you're jonesing for
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.260]   So anything that's not that is taking a lot of energy and intention from you
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:35.200]   So if you're at all tired, like well, that's just what I'm going to do. We're used to this from the addiction community
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.820]   You know, this is my when I'm stressed I pick up a cigarette
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:45.340]   When I'm sad, I pick up a drink right? There's there's all of these addictive
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.740]   Behaviors that historically you build these
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:54.700]   Connections in your brain that when you feel a certain way you go to the behavior and when you look at these
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.980]   solutions to addiction from the addiction
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.180]   community often they're built around
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.780]   replacement activities
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:08.020]   Okay, you need something else you do when you're stressed instead of picking up the cigarette and you have to figure out how to
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:10.620]   How to make that habit
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.680]   Replace the original right this is why
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:20.100]   You know, you might see a lot of heavy coffee drinkers among those who have just quit a substance and other types of substance abuse
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.780]   They're replacing the activity with something else
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.000]   They can go to or carrot sticks used to be a big one
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.100]   Are you see a lot of people leaving a substance addiction who get really fit because their exercise is replacing?
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.900]   They have to have a replacement activity these connections get really strong now
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:39.220]   The behavioral addictions created by things like doom scrolling reddit are not nearly as strong as substance addictions
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:43.140]   There's no chemical here that's crossing the blood-brain barrier and messing around with your actual
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.860]   neurotransmitter
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.900]   Uptake so our
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:52.420]   Challenge here is not as hard as stopping smoking when you get stressed, but we have the same principles
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.060]   so what I would do is a
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.460]   Look at replacement activities
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:02.420]   high quality leisure activities at all different levels of energy
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:08.580]   Requirements that you pursue and build in the habit and find enjoyment on some that require very little energy at all
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:14.500]   Some that require more energy and then to add some obstacles to the current addictive behavior
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:19.880]   I would say practice the phone for your method when you come home you plugged up phone in in your foyer of your house
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.580]   It's there if you need to go look something up
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.340]   But it's not right there in their pocket when you're in the armchair
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.660]   You're at the dinner table. You're trying to watch a TV show
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.340]   You would have to get up and go find it
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:32.380]   To go to read it and you would have to read read it standing up in the foyer
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.620]   And you're like, I'm not gonna do that
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:38.160]   So you have a little bit of an obstacle and then you invest in trying to find these other activities
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.540]   It could be moving to fun books paperback books
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.420]   Finding you know
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:48.380]   1970s era pocket paperbacks of spy thrillers things that don't take energy to read that you get used to thinking they're fun
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:53.480]   Could be listening to the radio or sports on the radio yard work or craft magazine reading
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:59.900]   TV watching walking with an audiobook different types of exercise all sorts of activities you can through practice and intention
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:05.260]   Have them build up connections of this is what I do when I'm tired and I'm bored and I get a lot of fulfillment
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.220]   out of it
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   so you got to go find and
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.900]   cultivate the alternatives and make the
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:15.460]   Behavior you're trying to get away from a little bit more difficult and then give it two weeks
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:19.300]   Takes about two weeks and you will find I have very little interest in doom scrolling
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.160]   But I do I put on the baseball game on the radio and if it's a little earlier
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.460]   I like to go for a walk and listen to a funny podcast
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.660]   It's not that hard to get these alternatives, but you do have to do a little bit of work
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:37.780]   Jeremy and Jeff got a lot of J's here. All right, let's break that trend Jesse. Who's our next question from is
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.700]   Is it a guy with a J name?
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.180]   Next question is from Shelly. Actually, there we go
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:47.040]   You have talked about unrestricted smartphone usage not being a good idea for kids
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.900]   Do you think heavy smartphone usage by retirees can worsen their cognitive skills?
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:56.820]   My mother is 65 and their smartphone usage has really shot up since they retired
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:04.020]   It's really common you you hear about this a lot people's parents of our generation their parents retire and
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:09.020]   For the first time really begin using a smartphone. They don't have nearly as much to do
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.700]   There's not as much structure to their activities and they get really caught up with
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.300]   Online all the time hitting that dopamine
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.380]   It's like the kid who is raised without having access to sugar
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:25.420]   And when they first get to college and have a meal plan card are buying Twinkies every day at the convenience store
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:30.340]   Because like wow, I didn't realize this stuff tasted so great. I'm gonna eat these every day. So that it is a big problem
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.060]   I hear about it a lot
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.180]   Um, if you're retiring that I was like, yeah, keep that in mind
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:40.460]   You need to more so than you had to when you were working and raising kids and doing all this other stuff
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:46.180]   You have to more than you did back then really structure your leisure time. What do I want to do with my time?
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:51.660]   I think using the deep life buckets are a great way forward. Here's the aspects of my life now that I'm retired
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.540]   Let me work on each but keystone habits and rules in place and then overhaul
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:02.140]   One by one these aspects of my life choose at least one bucket to make a radical investment in so where you make a radical
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:05.100]   Move to support that bucket. You should always have at least one where you're doing that
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:11.680]   So if it's Constitution, you're like I'm gonna be one of these super fit 70 year olds or if it's contemplation
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.860]   You might get very seriously involved in your church or whatever it is, right?
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:20.780]   You got to put a lot of energy into that because idle hands are the devil's playground and that's going to be the case
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.900]   Whether you're 65 or you're 16
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:30.380]   So I'd be careful about it. Now if it's your own parent, it's not what you can do. I mean you could
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:34.840]   Gently tell them about digital minimalism and etc. But you know, what?
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.620]   Was Dave Ramsey calls it?
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:43.380]   Was it like diaper bum wiping syndrome or something? It's like if I change your diaper, I'm not gonna take advice from you
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.740]   So it's very hard
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:48.860]   Look if you're 70, you know, someone who's 75 and is on their phone all the time
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:53.700]   Now you can also say they've earned whatever they want to do. I mean if they've had a long life
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.480]   They've done a lot of things and if that's what they want to do
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.940]   I'm not gonna stop them. But if I myself was retiring I wouldn't want to end up
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.880]   I think that's a in some sense a waste of these years. So if it's yourself getting older
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:07.540]   Really focus on structuring building around the buckets
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:12.400]   It's more important now than it's ever been if you know someone who's older who's on their phone too much, you know
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.900]   You can tell them about this type of stuff, but I just wouldn't expect much changes
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:24.460]   Alright who Dave Ramsey gets these calls all the time by the way, yeah parents like my parents are yeah
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:30.880]   Doing their finances wrong and his answer is always like you're not gonna be able to change that or my parents are eating unhealthy
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.620]   Yeah, it's like you're not gonna change that. Yeah. Yeah that that one you're gonna have to let their friends do that
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.620]   Their parents aren't gonna listen to you
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.940]   Hey, did you see by the way speaking of Dave Ramsey
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:46.660]   My old friend Ramit Sethi has his new finance show out on a Netflix
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:51.380]   I saw he came out with a book and I listened to a podcast on the divine
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:56.220]   So he has a new he has a new show how to be rich sort of a big splashy Netflix show
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.140]   It's like a net Dave Ramsey type thing
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:03.460]   He goes and sits down with couples who are having financial issues and like helps him with it
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:08.220]   That's what this podcast is about - yeah, so there's a TV version. It's kind of stressful. I
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:15.060]   Would be so bad at this, you know me like I have a very limited quota for how long I want to be around other people
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:20.340]   You know, I'm not extroverted and they have to like work with all these really tense situations
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.580]   We're like that he hasn't told her about the money he spent on this and they're also upset
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:31.780]   I would just be crawling for the exit but Ramit's great with that type of stuff. He's big into like living a life that like
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:39.680]   Designing a life that wouldn't be hindered by money and then trying to design the same as your value base career cycle centric planning
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   Yeah, he's my I've known him since
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.340]   like 2004 2005
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.940]   I
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:52.340]   Remember Ramit was the first person to tell me he's like I have this friend and his name's Tim Ferris and he wrote this book
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.420]   It's really gonna be big and I think you should read it. I remember that he was buddies with Tim back then
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.740]   His brother is cool to Manish
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.700]   Entrepreneur
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:07.340]   Cool family. Oh and I wrote about Manish's in one of my books. So it's all yeah all connected. Oh connected
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.580]   All right. Let's say let's do another question. What do we got?
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.140]   All right. Next question is from Ryan
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:18.660]   Your audience knows that you're not prone to adopt software devices just because they're new or make a claim to improve your life
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.900]   Could you give some guidelines on how to think about adopting new technology or software?
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.860]   It's like Ryan my default approach is just to avoid new things
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:32.760]   If I can avoid it, I will if I can kludge together something. I'm already working. That's what I'll do
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.640]   And then if I finally decide to use something
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.780]   Very likely to stop using it
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:44.180]   I'll be alright. I'm kind of using this but my default is to get frustrated and did not use it to fall away from it
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.660]   Or to stop using it. I'm not a big believer in
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.740]   the techno utopian vision of cybernetic productivity
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:58.980]   That with the right combination of tools and human you unlock these new levels of production
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:03.420]   I often feel that the chore of organizing information and
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.640]   action and making plans, you know, it's a
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.620]   Militarian chore. It's a rote chore. It's not that interesting
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:14.900]   You need some sort of system that can keep track of this stuff
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.340]   But simplicity and low friction is what's really important. That's something you can just do repeatedly
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.060]   You don't have too much friction to get in the way
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:27.780]   The difference between a good system and a bad system is a difference of four minutes in your daily planning
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:31.660]   It doesn't really matter and so the overhead of trying to optimize
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.340]   Technology tools is often worse than just you have something that works good enough
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:42.620]   I got an email the other day. I forgot exactly what the wording was, but they're talking about like how could you
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:50.100]   How could you be leaving all this productivity on the table that if you they were upset with I guess that I was using incompatible
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.780]   technology systems of my when I track my tasks that I have Trello and
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.420]   Google Docs and
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.540]   Whatever a Google Calendar and other thing you could have a seamless
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:06.900]   System they were saying where everything kind of connects together and you could automate certain things and how could you give up all that productivity?
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.420]   Here's what that's giving up
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:16.620]   The difference between I spend three minutes or six minutes on Monday morning making my plan for the day. It doesn't matter
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.700]   What matters is like the 60 minutes I spend actually trying to do something good
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:25.980]   Do I give it my full attention and don't context which that makes a difference whether it takes me
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:33.700]   I automatically have things jump into my you know notion board or I manually move it who cares is we're talking minutes out of out of
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.180]   thousands of minutes that happen in the week, so
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.500]   To me new stuff is annoying
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:44.420]   So I'm usually relatively reluctant and then once I let it in I let it fall back out unless it really earns its place
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:49.820]   And then if it does I'm really loyal to it. I would say the latest tool that's really earned its place technological tool
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:56.940]   That's earned its place in my life in the sense that I didn't use before and now I use it regularly is probably Scrivener
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:05.860]   Probably the writing software Scrivener had enough advantages over just using Microsoft Word that it's stuck
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.980]   I came into it tentatively, but I've now written a
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:15.220]   Full book in it and probably a dozen New Yorker articles using it and it's stuck
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:21.420]   So it really earned its keep by doing something nothing else was doing in a way that consistently made my life better
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:26.060]   That's what I'm really looking for and if it doesn't do that. It's probably not gonna probably not gonna stick around
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:31.740]   Yeah, I got some pushback from we did that notebook fallacy piece
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:35.780]   Yeah, where I said like looks professional idea people
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.540]   Don't spend very much time
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:43.300]   managing or tracking or building systems to control their ideas the the
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:48.500]   Proper organization and controlling and categorization and linking of ideas and digital systems
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:53.300]   It's just not something that professional thinkers actually spend much time doing and there's sort of like a correlation between that
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.780]   It's a lot of people who like to do that and did not like that claim. Mm-hmm. That's true
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.460]   Professional thinkers have plenty of ideas that they know it all it's all down to
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:11.100]   Execution. Yeah. Yeah, in fact not having a system could be an advantage because if an idea sticks around I
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.700]   Didn't write it down anywhere, but it won't go away
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.540]   That's how I finally convinced myself
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:15.900]   All right
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:23.260]   Maybe this is the one I need to act on so like for like a movie producer or a screenwriter director the idea not leaving them
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.340]   Actually is what they're looking for to see if an idea is good
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:32.900]   So in some sense having some sort of complicated Zettelkasten system that's constantly showing them things that could be interesting to making connections would defeat
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.540]   the point
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.940]   Mm-hmm
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:40.700]   All right. Let's uh, let's do one more. Let's keep rolling here. All right last questions from Patrick. Thanks for your work
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:46.100]   I got a note by my doctoral supervisor handling me handing me a world without email
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:51.740]   Which changed my life now, I feel more intentional about my choices than ever before. Here's my question
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.980]   What advice do you have on staying deep when traveling to academic conferences?
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.620]   So there's a little bit more background on here Patrick is
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:03.980]   He's a PhD student maybe a postdoc now and he's starting to travel
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.340]   I guess his timing was such that a lot of his
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:11.580]   Education had been during the pandemic where things were virtual now. He's traveling again. So he's wondering about it
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:18.380]   I traveled a lot in my academic career, especially as a grad student all throughout grad school into my postdoc years
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.020]   traveled the world
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:27.220]   Because what happens is advisors don't want to go to all of these places to present papers because it's a pain
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:31.300]   That's what grad students are for and so I I spent my 20s
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:37.500]   Traveling all over Europe and South America and Canada in the US presenting papers and traveling on the cheap, etc
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:43.100]   So I have a big experience with it. I would say Patrick don't worry about being deep while traveling for conferences
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.660]   Here's my advice
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:51.580]   Wander whatever city you get to wander the city. I've spent a lot of time wandering a lot of cities around the world
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:59.900]   Meet people at your conference socialize learn who people are relationship building. It makes it a much more interesting experience
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:06.780]   Bring along what I call optional deep work something you can work on if you have time, but it's not necessary
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:10.860]   It's not my productivity depends on me finishing this while I'm at conferences
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:16.020]   I would sometimes find myself in that situation like a grant deadline and I had to finish at the conference
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.700]   But I prefer to have it be optional and if you do do deep work while at a conference
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.180]   Find a really cool place to do it
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:29.420]   This was a big challenge of mine. I loved finding really cool places to write when I was traveling around the world
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:33.740]   You know off the beaten path I can sit on a bench
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:40.100]   Overlooking the the river in Paris. I remember riding on a rooftop bar in Bologna
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.860]   And that's what I really enjoyed this trying to find interesting places to work
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:49.380]   And then finally my whole thing when I was traveling Patrick for conferences bring books
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:54.180]   You're excited to read you got the plane ride. You have this downtime. You're waiting the airport
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:59.380]   Bring a new book. This fun. Like I can't wait to read this and enjoy it
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:05.500]   Academic travel can be fun. So don't don't over productivity a size it you have plenty of time for that
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.060]   All right. So speaking of books Jesse. I want to get to the books
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.060]   I read in March
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:18.260]   2023 before I do I want to briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible. That's our friends at

[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.860]   no one would describe the post office right now as a

[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:05.780]   Have known Adam Gilbert the founder of my body tutor
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.260]   since
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:14.300]   2007 when he used to be the fitness advice guy for my study hot hacks blog. So he's been around doing this for a long time
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:21.460]   His company my body tutor is 100% online coaching that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.460]   Which is the lack of consistency
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:30.020]   They do this by simplifying the process of getting healthier and more fit into practical sustainable behaviors and then giving you daily
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:36.680]   Accountability and support to stick to your plan. You are assigned to coach you report to the coach through an app every day
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.660]   They give you advice. They give you encouragement if you need to adjust something
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:45.140]   I'm going on a trip and what am I gonna do with my workout routine? They're there to help you
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.700]   Hey, just do this when you get there. Let me give you a bodyweight thing to work on
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:52.940]   Oh, you're struggling with this part of our with eating our eating plan. Here's my suggestions
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.900]   So you get all that accountability of a coach, but because it's online
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:02.940]   You avoid that massive expense of actually having some sort of personal trainer that's coming to your house
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:08.580]   So I think it's a great idea and it is a very successful company because it's good at what it does
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.760]   I want to be healthier. I want to be fit. I actually wanted to stick

[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.220]   All right, Jesse, let's do some books
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:46.620]   Let's do it. All right. So these are the five books I read in March 2023
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.660]   We're recording this in April. So it still counts, even though you're gonna hear this in May
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.580]   the first book a
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.540]   short novel by Stephen King called the Colorado kid
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:04.440]   You know, I found this was a drugstore in Clearwater, Florida
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.180]   I was looking for another book to read
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:11.660]   I wanted something more fun as in a CVS in Clearwater Beach in Clearwater, Florida
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.660]   And they had a small book section
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.200]   Which was all Daniel Steele and then for some reason
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.820]   They had a hard case crime
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:25.440]   Edition of the Colorado kid by Stephen King. So it's this cool sort of short
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:32.460]   It's called an anti mystery because it's a it's a hard-boiled mystery type novel, but they never get to a solution
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.060]   it's sort of postmodern and
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:40.100]   And so you're you're learning about this case about this body that washed up on the shore of this small island in Maine
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.420]   And there's these two hard-nosed old newspaper men and they're telling it to their intern this young woman
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.740]   They're kind of walking through the story and these clues kind of pile up
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:56.740]   And no resolutions reached and so it's an anti-mystery. It's kind of deconstructing mystery. I love that hard case crime
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.860]   They did use beautiful cover art
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:03.540]   They re-released all of Michael Crichton's books. He wrote under a pseudonym in
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:09.320]   Med school they call them the med school files the med school books all with cool covers. Anyways, it was fun
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.320]   I read it on the beach and
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:16.100]   Enjoyed it nice, but just felt serendipitous. Why would that book?
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.460]   this
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.780]   2003 release from hard case crime. Why would that show up in this random CVS?
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.680]   But it was there and so I felt like it was a sign
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.060]   But I also read the unsettlers by Mark Sundin
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.380]   this one of these books where you have a sort of
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.320]   Very literate
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.840]   Harper style writer who sets out on sort of a personal quest and in this case
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.160]   He goes and spends times with people who lived very unconventional lives
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:54.440]   Sort of simple intentional lives of various types and and it's it's him spending time with these people and then reflecting on his own life
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.320]   So it's part memoir part observation and I was it was kind of interesting
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.640]   Yeah, you know, I bought this book a long time ago and then I just took it off my library shelf and read it
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:09.780]   I enjoyed it. He spent time with some people living very simply in Missouri and some urban farmers in Detroit
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.640]   among some others
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.680]   That's good
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.600]   does it uh
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.600]   Motivate you to get your cabin
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.400]   You know the weird thing about it
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.040]   And I think there's just the uncanny valley is that when he was hanging out with other young people like people are our age or younger
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.800]   They kind of annoyed you
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.020]   you know, but when he was talking about the the generation before who had like
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.180]   Moved to these farms or whatever in the 70s. It was fine. Like yeah, these people are doing what they're doing
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.180]   But when it was like other young people
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:44.880]   It made me feel a little curmudgeonly. I mean, I'm mr. Deep life
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.940]   There were there were cases from like I think you need a good job
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.880]   You know
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.980]   Because there's like some of this over-the-top stuff these people that really we put on capes and bike around the country to try to raise
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:16:00.360]   Awareness about bringing together the earth and then and you know it some of it felt like there's people super far adrift
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.460]   Yeah, not like okay. Here's what some they didn't go through a deep life
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:08.080]   Systematic exercise I'd say it's there's a lot of like big swings happening
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.720]   and
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.800]   So it's just like you feel like some of the young people I know people like that
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.680]   They always have a big idea and it's kind of weird and it's it's you know
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.960]   But then some of the people are really cool, but Mark's a great writer and it was interesting
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.000]   It really got me thinking but it was that book that led me to my next book
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.080]   Which was living the good life by Helen Scott nearing which we did a whole deep dive on a few weeks ago
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.120]   I
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.440]   Forgot exactly what we called it simple life or something like that
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:42.520]   But I read that after the unsettlers and this was the same idea like Helen Scott nearing leaving Manhattan and moving to the this farm in
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:49.600]   Vermont and homesteading but because they're depression era people there's this you they're not people you know, and then you can come at them
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.460]   With an objective remove and it's much more easy to sort of find aspiration and and draw example out of them
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:01.260]   So anyways, that book was cool. It was written in the 50s and I I did a whole deep dive on it
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:06.800]   So living the simple life or something like that. Yeah, so look for that episode if you want to find out more about it
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.800]   I bought an old version of that. I
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.940]   Felt like I needed a I got the 1974 edition
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:17.400]   Those type of books like to read in the original editions. I read a novel CJ box
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:22.020]   Had a somewhat recent novel called shadows real. I think I bought this in an airport somewhere
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:24.500]   I like CJ box
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:30.880]   he's his whole series is a game warden in Wyoming Joe Pickett and
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.100]   It's it's cool. I like the Wyoming stuff. This one's got a lot going on
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:39.220]   Stolen Falcons
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.500]   black lives matter protest
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:46.140]   murderous henchmen seeking stolen Nazi memorabilia
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:52.700]   Which has shown up in Wyoming and ended up in the possession of Joe Pickett's wife all of this happening in the same book
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.300]   That's fine
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:01.860]   So stolen Nazi memorabilia that stuff that the Nazis stole like while they were in power and then no GI
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:06.820]   American GI took when they raided the Eagle's Nest
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.620]   Hitler's whatever
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.660]   and
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.580]   I guess there was something I don't want to spoil too much
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:16.560]   But there was a photo album that a GI brought home
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:22.140]   To Wyoming to where Joe Pickett lives and it got passed down to his son and there's something
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:29.580]   incriminating in there for I guess a political leader now in Eastern Europe and so he sends
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.820]   These henchmen the big sleep County to go get it back
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:38.100]   And they're kind of murderers and kill a bunch of people and but anyways someone drops it off at the library
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.420]   Joe Pickett's wife is a librarian
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:44.500]   So she has it and they're coming to there they're kind of lurking around the house and and all this type of stuff is going on
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:50.140]   You know, it's interesting CJ box has got into some Twitter con Twitter countries aren't real controversies, but he's
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.680]   He's moved more. There's like more politics in his book
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:59.060]   Like not super right-wing politics, but like right-of-center politics, you know
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.820]   And then he's getting pushback like why is this it's just like why is this so right wing or something?
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.900]   And he says that's Joe. He's like these are the for a what's he trying to say?
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:16.020]   He's saying these are the politics of this makes sense. If you were a game ward in Wyoming. This is not my politics
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.660]   This is the politics of the world of the book. So he's in this interesting
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:23.740]   Back and forth. I was like, wow, this is interesting. There's a whole plot line in here about
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:28.420]   Antifa and in the book it's all
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.140]   Really
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:37.060]   overprivileged white kids from rich households who are like dressing up and stuff and
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.020]   Are like completely hopeless and are being manipulated by this evil guy who stole the Falcons
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.020]   So it's like the whole plot line this whole like anti-antifa
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.140]   It's like pro black life matter
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.140]   anti-antifa like all this stuff is in
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:55.500]   CJ box when I think of CJ box is typically like Joe Pickett is
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:59.140]   You know, there's been a murder in the woods and he's in the game board
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.140]   And so I don't know CJ is going in interesting places
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:07.380]   When was it written that's pretty recent because it's all I mean it takes place during the like
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:13.260]   It must take place during the when we're all those those protests and riots and stuff was 2020, right?
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:20.180]   So it has been written after that. I don't read a lot of CJ, but I always like the idea of liking genre books
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.220]   detective books or these type of books and
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:28.760]   I just I never really get into I never really have gotten into a series like the last genre writer
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.860]   I really just read everything was Michael Crichton when I was when I was young
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.640]   But these new ones were like here's here's the character
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:41.980]   You know, it's like Hieronymus Bosch and Connelly or Joe Pickett and CJ box and here's the character and every year
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.140]   There's a new book and it's this character. I
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:50.340]   Really love the idea of being really into those but it just doesn't click with me even the good ones like CJ box is fine
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.380]   You know Connelly is much better like Michael Connelly is great at this, but I just can't get into I've read some
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:01.580]   It just doesn't I don't know why it doesn't do it for me. It's like fantasy. Like I should like fantasy books and
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:04.740]   I have a hard time
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.980]   And I blame Brandon Sanderson
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:10.980]   Somehow his fault like I should be a fantasy book fan
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:14.500]   But you know, I don't I get bored. It's too much like
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:20.860]   Thou is the wizard staff will smite the dwarf or whatever and I should love that stuff and I don't know
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:26.060]   Maybe it's just fiction. I'm just not a accomplished fiction writer. How many of the Stephen King books have you read?
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.060]   I have a hard time with King
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.300]   Because they're so long and he you know, he all of his good books
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.500]   He wrote on coke and it's all like stream of content just like boom. It's all over the place
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:38.780]   It's really interesting approach, but it's like not my style
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:42.820]   So I like the short ones like the Colorado kid is like great King
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:49.820]   Yeah, but I read like 300 pages of fairy tale and finally gave up because really it's it's it's a very interesting tone
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.820]   it's very accessible and
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:59.620]   Conversational and I don't know it just feels too like it's just going and things or he's spinning out ideas and doing this and that
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:05.540]   And I don't know. It's not my style. I like a tighter a tighter thing, but I should like Stephen King, you know
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:09.140]   I mean, I'm telling you there's all these books. I should like I did read name of the wind
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.860]   I did actually read all of name of the wind and I did enjoy it. So kudos Brandon Sanderson
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:19.540]   For name of the wind I did read that it was good and I read half of the second one and then I sort of
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.820]   Lost steam. I think it's an issue I have with fiction
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:24.980]   But my last book was also fiction. So I have three
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:33.700]   Three novels on my list. Mm-hmm. The last one was Haven by Emma Donahue and it's just a novel about
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:37.500]   The monks who
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:42.240]   Inhabited Skellig Island off of the west coast of Ireland
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.740]   So there's this like desolate rock
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:51.080]   Where there's a real monastery that was built on there during the medieval period and I saw it. I was out there
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:55.960]   Years ago. I spent some time in Dingle on the west coast of Ireland
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:01.360]   Which is real near real near to there and it's a real place a real monastery. They used it the film scenes from
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.880]   The rise of Skywalker. So like the place where Luke Skywalker is like hiding away on that island
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.160]   That's Skellig Island. And so this is a fictionalizes historical fiction. So it's a fictionalized account of like the original
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:19.080]   monks and it just starts inland in Ireland and they sort of make their way out there and they try to
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:24.300]   They try to tame it and inhabit and that's the book. That was pretty good. Gotta be cold out there on that island
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.660]   Yeah, it's not optimal
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:29.220]   Not optimal. I looked up the reality. So in reality
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:37.020]   They used it seasonally for a while like the actual way it turns out is they would they raise sheep on it
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.460]   And they would use it seasonally. It's not far from land
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.920]   So the monks would come out there and they would stay on there during the summer when they're because they would keep sheep there
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.860]   But they wouldn't live there full-time. They wouldn't live there in the winter
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:51.820]   They'd come back to the mainland it turns out to be the reality and then and then at some point they built some more permanent
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.820]   stuff and then the Vikings just
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.820]   You know how the Vikings do
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:03.580]   It was good. I give it like a 7 out of 10. It was like fine writing not great writing. That's pretty good
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:10.800]   Yeah, not like a great novel but also better than shadows real by CJ box. So like on the on the scale
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.260]   it's a it's
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:17.580]   There is no Falcons being stolen or murderous Nazi Nazi henchmen
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:21.380]   That's pretty good book, but it wasn't my I'm not thinking I got to recommend this to everybody
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:25.060]   But I'm proud of myself for reading three novels. Yeah, like for me
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:27.820]   the uncharacteristic
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.900]   All right. Well anyways speaking of
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.940]   Novels, I'll just do with novels, but we should wrap it up
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:40.020]   Thank you everyone for listening. Today's episode. We'll be back with another episode next week and
[01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.620]   Until then as always stay deep
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:47.540]   [MUSIC]
