[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Number one, how big of an emergency fund do I need?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Specifically, how would I figure that out
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   in sitting for the CFP exam?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Number two, where should I keep it?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And number three, what are the financial ratios
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   that I should apply to my household
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   to figure out if the household is running in a safe manner?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   This is episode 197.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Gonna share with you some information
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   that you will need if you're ever gonna sit
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   for the CFP exam, but it's also applicable
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   to, I don't know, what should I call us,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   normal people who aren't CFPs?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   (laughs)
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   The point is, I'm gonna give you the technical answer today
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   of how big of an emergency fund do I need
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   with just a little bit of expansion for individuals.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You're ultimately gonna have to be the person
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   to decide for yourself how big of an emergency fund
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   that you actually need.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's a very individual decision,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   but there is a little bit of technical formal guidance
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   that we can give.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Specifically, this is the technical formal guidance
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   that you would need if you were sitting for the CFP exam.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And this way of thinking, I believe,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   you'll be able to find helpful to apply it to your life
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and think about the risk factors.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   According to the CFP board, their standards
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and their curriculum that they set out,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   or at least the way that you'll be tested on the exam,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   the way that you find an emergency fund
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   is somewhere between three and six months worth of expenses.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And so you total up, if you are presented
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   with something like a budget, you total up
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   all of the fixed and variable expenses for a household,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and you're going to either choose
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   a three-month emergency fund or a six-month emergency fund.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   If you ever pay attention to common personal finance advice,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   you'll often hear this three to six months number
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   tossed around.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Well, obviously, though, there's a big difference
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   between three and six months.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   After all, six months of expenses is exactly
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   double three months of expenses.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So it's probably going to take you,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   if you're saving for this starting from zero,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   it may take you twice as much time
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   to get to six months of expenses, which
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   might delay your transitioning from building an emergency fund
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   to pursuing other financial goals.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It might delay that for a period of time
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   because you've got to save all this money.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So how would you decide?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Well, it's based upon the risk factors of income.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And the key is you're going to look to figure out
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   how many sources of income are there in a household.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   If there are multiple sources of income into a household,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   then you probably have fewer risk factors
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   of losing an income.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   If you and your spouse are both gainfully employed,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   both receiving an income, then it's possible
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   that one of you will lose your job,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   but it's less likely that both of you
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   will lose your job at the same time.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So therefore, it would probably be OK
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   to have a slightly smaller emergency fund
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   because even in the case of one job loss,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   you would have some savings, and then you would have
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   one spouse continuing to work.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So that's basically the approach that the CFP board recommends.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And when you're sitting for the exam,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   if you're a prospective financial planner,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   you will always look and try to figure out
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   how many sources of income there are into the household.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   If you have a single wage earner,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   one individual person in a household,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   then you're automatically going to recommend
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   a six-month emergency fund.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Or if you have a married household,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   but only one spouse is earning income,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   then you're also going to automatically recommend
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   a six-month emergency fund.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   In those cases, the concentration of risk
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   in a single job is quite high,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   so you'll always transition to that six-month emergency fund.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   However, if you have a single wage earner
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   who has a second source of income of some type,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   in that case, you're going to go ahead
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and look to a three-month emergency fund,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and that's the answer you're going to suggest
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   on the CFP board exam.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Or if you have a married household
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   where both spouses are earning income,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   or if you have a married couple
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   where only one spouse is working,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   but the other spouse has another form of income,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   for example, another spouse is receiving alimony payments,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   or perhaps one of the spouses or parties is very wealthy,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   has investment accounts that they're pulling money from,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   they're financially established and basically well-funded,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   or if there's a large trust fund providing income,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   rights of withdrawal, something like that,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   under those circumstances,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   then you're safe to go ahead
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and recommend the three-month fund.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It's as simple as that, and that's what you need
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   if you're going to take the CFP board exam.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   That's what you need to remember.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now, if you are looking at this
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   for your own personal financial planning,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   for your own household,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   just take this concept and extend it,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and the importance is looking at
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   how risky are my sources of cash flow.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   The problem with the recommendation
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   of three to six months is that it's necessarily vague
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   because it's applying to a general population.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's okay if you make a choice to extend that out
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and you say, "I feel more comfortable
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "with a one-year emergency fund,"
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   or if you want to,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I wouldn't go much below three months of expenses,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   but you can choose your own number.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But look at it with the same principle in mind
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and say, "What are the risks to our household
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "if we lose our income?"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Now, what assets qualify as being useful
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   for saving in an emergency fund?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Number one, currency, cash, dollar bills,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   or whatever the currency of choice is in your environment.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That's obviously useful and applicable
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   as being counted in the emergency fund.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Any checking accounts,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   as long as you are not planning on funds
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   that are normally used for day-to-day living expenses.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So it'd be good to have emergency funds
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   allocated into a different account,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   into a different checking account,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   or also some kind of savings account.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That would be good.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Government money market accounts
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   or CDs that have a short-term maturity,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   less than or equal to,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   if you're going by the official CFP board standards
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   for trying to figure out when looking at a balance sheet,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   which of these accounts can I use as an emergency fund,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   less than or equal to 90 days,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   or a laddered CD program
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   with maturities of less than or equal to six months?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So if you're a financial planning practitioner,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   look for those accounts,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and those are the accounts that you can use
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   if presented with a balance sheet.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Those are the accounts that you can use
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   to say that these are part of the emergency funds.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Checking accounts, currency, savings accounts,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   government money market accounts,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and CDs with a maturity of less than or equal to 90 days,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   or laddered CDs with a maturity of less than or equal to six months.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   There are no other asset classes that will formally qualify.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   There are other assets that might be stable enough
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   to be used as a portion of your savings accounts,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   but there are no other asset classes that will formally qualify
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   for the purposes of the CFP board exam.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Finally, let's talk for a moment about ratios.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   These are some ratios that financial planning practitioners
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   are tested on on the CFP board exam.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   There are also ratios that you should sit down
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and take a look at your own personal budget.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   These are the recommendations for the general population,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   so they're probably not as hardcore as many of you who are listening,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   but it's still a good way to test yourself
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and to make sure you're at least within the guidelines
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   for the normal population.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The first ratio is what percentage of your income
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   should your total housing expenses be?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   So housing expenses in this circumstance would be defined
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   as either your mortgage payment, inclusive of principal, interest,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   taxes and insurance, or your rent payment.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Either one of those would be fine,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   and that number should be either 28% or less
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   of your total household budget.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So the way that you figure this out is take either your monthly--
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   excuse me, your annual mortgage.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You could do it either on a monthly basis or on an annual basis.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I'll do it on an annual basis here.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   But take your monthly payment and divide that into your gross income,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   your total amount of income, and for good financial health,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   that number should be 28% or less.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So as an example, let's say you have an income of just above median income,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   so call it $50,000 per year,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and let's say that your monthly rent payments
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   or your monthly principal, interest, taxes, and insurance payment,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   your total mortgage payment if you're escrowing taxes and insurance,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   your monthly payment is $1,000.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Take $1,000, multiply that times 12.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That gives you your total annual expenditure.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Then divide $12,000, divide that by $50,000 for your annual income,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   whatever your total gross annual income is,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   the amount of income before taxes and expenses.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   That will give you a percentage ratio.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So in that example, it would be 24%.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   If you were earning $50,000 per year household income
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and you're spending $1,000 a month on housing expenses, that would be 24%.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   That would be good health.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Again, some of you will be far more extreme than this, some of you will not.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   But at least on the general population
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and specifically with regard to the CFP board exam,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   that number needs to be 28% or less of your gross income.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   If your housing expenses are higher than that for you as an individual,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   consider why and consider making changes.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It can start to be dangerous if your housing expenses are higher
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   than that number in your monthly budget.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Another number that the CFP board will test on is
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   what should be the ratio of your total monthly debt payments
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   as compared to gross income.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The number there that they've selected is
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   your total monthly debt payments should be 36% or less of your gross income.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So any debt payments at all, that can include mortgage,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   that can include consumer debt, car loans, student loans,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   any of those numbers should be 36% or less of your gross income.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So take your gross income, let's just use that $50,000 number again,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and then simply choose 36% of that and that would be $18,000.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So for a just over median income household,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   $1,500 a month should be the maximum amount of the total debt payments.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   The final ratio is what percentage of income should consumer debt be.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And in this case, the CFP board has chosen the number of 20% of net income.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So here you would take your income after taxes and deductions
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and whatever that number is,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   at least the consumer debt should be at least less than 20%.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And if you'll run those numbers,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   you can start to get an idea of where you stack up.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   If your ratios are higher than those numbers,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   that should be a red flag for you.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   So if your housing expenses are higher than 28% of your gross income,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   or if your total monthly debt including housing expenses and consumer debt
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   is greater than 36% of your gross income,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   or if your consumer debt is greater than 20% of your net income,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   that should be a big red flag and you should take steps to arrange that,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   to improve the situation because it puts a lot of stress on your budget,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   puts a lot of stress on the household,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   puts a lot of stress on your overall plan because the ratios are too high
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   to give some wiggle room and some freedom.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   And obviously, the lower you can get those numbers, the better.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Finally, for CFP board students,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   make sure that you know how to calculate what we call a current ratio.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Usually, you'll use the concept of ratios, liquidity ratios,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and current ratios when looking at business calculations.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But from time to time,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   you will see these applied to personal financial statements.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And you want to make sure that you know how to do a current ratio calculation.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's very simple.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   You take current assets and divide those by current liabilities.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Current assets would be cash or cash equivalents,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Obviously, that's the business definition applied over to personal financial planning,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   but I want to be precise with it.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And then current liabilities would be accounts payable,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   credit card debt, and taxes payable.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We don't include long-term structured debts like mortgage payments in this number
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   unless we are including the current amount.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   So for example, your mortgage payment is $1,500 and $1,500 is due.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Then you would include that,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   but you wouldn't include the total balance of the mortgage here.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Take those current assets, divide it by the current liabilities,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and that will give you a number.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So as an example, let's say that you have $5,000 in a checking account,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   $10,000 in a money market account, that equals $15,000,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   and you have $3,000 of credit card debt.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Take $15,000, divide it by $3,000, and you wind up with a number of 5.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   That's the current ratio.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Do not include in this number for assets.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Don't include things like 401(k) accounts or other structured long-term deferred
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   assets because the cost of turning them into cash is too high to calculate.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   They're not a current asset.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   They're not a cash or cash equivalent.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   The cost of converting them into money, into cash that you can spend,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   is too expensive.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   They don't fit the definition.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   But that will give you a ratio.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   That ratio is going to be primarily useful for comparing among different
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   households.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Ratios are mostly meaningless on their own.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   If you're just running this for your own household, it's good for you to know,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   but you would need to be able to compare it to other households.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   So this would be more useful for financial planners to compare households
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   or it will be just a simple answer on the CFP board exam that you might need
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   to know how to do.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So my challenge to you is if you're a CFP board practitioner,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   go ahead and learn these, or if you're an individual,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   go ahead and calculate them.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And just check to make sure in the same way that knowing what the standard,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   say BMI or height and weight numbers are,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   that can be useful for your health to be able to judge that.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But you have to take it with a grain of salt.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   So you take those generalized numbers,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and if your numbers are out of the normal range,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   then look to try to figure out why your numbers are out of the normal range.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   There may be a good reason for it, but be aware.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It can be a red flag for you.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Hopefully this is useful.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I know it's just a short thing.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   This is a type of concept that you need to know for the CFP board exam,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   but it doesn't fit necessarily into a larger show,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   so that's why I've chosen to do it in a very simple scenario here.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Calculate the emergency funds, 3 months and 6 months.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   6 months if you are a single wage earner in a household
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   or have a household with one wage earner.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   3 months if there are secondary sources of income.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Run these ratios.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Housing expense, 28% or less of your gross income.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Total monthly debt, 36% or less of your gross income.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Consumer debt should be 20% or less of your net income.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Calculate the current ratio with current assets divided by current liabilities.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Thank you all so much for listening.
