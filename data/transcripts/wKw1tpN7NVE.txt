[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380]   "Mariam" asks, "Hello Lex.
[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.420]   "In your interview with Ariana,
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.920]   "you have mentioned that suffering is good for the soul.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.260]   "Where did that come from?
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.560]   "What is your belief system for maintaining
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   "self-discipline and strong character no matter what?"
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480]   I think a lot of that is quite personal
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.260]   in the sense that you have to know yourself.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.960]   What's the distribution of energy levels that you have?
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.840]   Like how, what makes you lazy?
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.720]   What makes you excited?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   What makes you motivated?
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.080]   I think that's different from person to person.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.160]   But there's several things I could say.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.460]   I think for me,
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.020]   I try to do something difficult every day.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.920]   Something I don't want to do.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.860]   Really, if you open your mind,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.200]   your ear to the moments where
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.360]   you don't really feel like doing it,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.760]   do it.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   Those kinds of things,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.240]   I think train your mind in the right kind of way
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.380]   to take on the things in your life
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.480]   that you know you should be doing,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.900]   but are hard and so you try to avoid them.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.040]   I mean, just training that muscle,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.360]   not on real things,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   but every day on things as silly as,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   like for example, sometimes I'll take a freezing cold shower.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.960]   I usually kind of ask myself,
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.560]   is this something I really don't feel like doing right now?
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.460]   And I never really feel like doing a cold shower,
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.000]   but there's some days where I really don't want to,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.720]   and that's when I'll do it.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.660]   And I'll stand under the water for at least one minute,
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.900]   just freezing cold.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.420]   Sometimes it could be as silly as you're feeling down,
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.640]   but, and you go to like,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.680]   I go to a Starbucks and then you don't feel like smiling
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.480]   or being friendly, but you do it.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.500]   I don't feel like doing it and I do it.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.600]   So just practicing that muscle.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.320]   Exercise, heck yeah, every single day.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.980]   I don't really, especially running.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.460]   I don't like running, that's why I do it.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   I don't, especially don't like starting to run.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.880]   Getting out there, starting to run the first mile,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   first two miles is something that I don't want to do
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.700]   in the moment and I do it.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.920]   I think that's those little moments.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.680]   You know, it sounds dramatic to call that suffering,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   but it really is discomfort,
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.460]   struggle that trains your mind in the way that
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.100]   in other things that you are deeply passionate about
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.540]   that are long-term parts of your life,
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.860]   allows you to pursue them long-term through the dark parts,
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.740]   through the struggle,
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.620]   through the suffering of mental and physical.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.580]   So mental is the self-doubt.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.540]   You know, there's so many days I wake up full of doubt.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.420]   And I think those days, those moments
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.440]   are not something you can take on without practice.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.720]   It's, especially if you do difficult things,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.180]   especially if you do things that are not traditional
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.180]   or so on, but really everybody hits the wall
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.180]   often enough if you do something big.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.980]   I think that's something you have to take seriously
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.260]   and you have to practice and practice and practice.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.220]   And a big part of practice, at least for me, is habits.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.220]   So most things I have noticed myself getting good at
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.940]   and most things I care about that I want to solve
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.900]   are things I do every day without exception.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.220]   To me, to me, it's better to do something
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.300]   for one minute a day, every day, without exception,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   than doing it once a month for an entire day.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.860]   I think there's something about that ritual
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.540]   that multiplies your mind's ability
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.540]   to really take on the full depths of whatever the task is.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.700]   (silence)
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.860]   (silence)
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.020]   (silence)
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.180]   (silence)
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.340]   (silence)
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.500]   (silence)
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.660]   (silence)
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.820]   (silence)
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
