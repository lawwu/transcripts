[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940]   - The emergence of space-time.
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.040]   - That's right.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.260]   - Okay, so I thought space-time was fundamental.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.100]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.360]   - So this sort of dream that Einstein had
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.120]   that everybody had and everybody has
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.280]   of the theory of everything.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.240]   So how do we build up from many worlds,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.000]   from quantum mechanics, a model of space-time,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.980]   a model of gravity?
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.760]   - Well, yeah, I mean, let me first mention very quickly
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.360]   why we think it's necessary.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.300]   We've had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.540]   to us for over a hundred years now, like 1915 or 1916,
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.220]   he put general relativity in the final form.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.820]   So gravity is the curvature of space-time,
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.300]   and there's a field that pervades all the universe
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.780]   that tells us how curved space-time is.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.660]   - And that's a fundamentally classical.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.820]   - That's totally classical, right, exactly.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.420]   But we also have a formalism, an algorithm
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.680]   for taking a classical theory and quantizing it.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.620]   This is how we get quantum electrodynamics, for example.
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.580]   And it could be tricky.
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.260]   I mean, you think you're quantizing something,
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.220]   so that means taking a classical theory
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.120]   and promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.580]   but you can run into problems.
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.260]   So they ran into problems when they did that
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.180]   with electromagnetism,
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.660]   namely that certain quantities were infinity
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.020]   and you don't like infinity, right?
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.800]   So Feynman and Tomonaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.900]   for teaching us how to deal with the infinities.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.060]   And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.180]   for saying you shouldn't have been worried
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.040]   about those infinities after all.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.680]   But still, it's always the thought
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.520]   that that's how you will make a good quantum theory.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.580]   You'll start with a classical theory and quantize it.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.040]   So if we have a classical theory, general relativity,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640]   we can quantize it or we can try to,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.880]   but we run into even bigger problems with gravity
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.520]   than we ran into with electromagnetism.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.760]   And so far, those problems are insurmountable.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.960]   We have not been able to get a successful theory
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.740]   of quantum gravity by starting
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.680]   with classical general relativity and quantizing it.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.140]   And there's evidence that,
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.580]   there's a good reason why this is true,
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.780]   that whatever the quantum theory of gravity is,
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.660]   it's not a field theory.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.540]   It's something that has weird non-local features
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.980]   built into it somehow that we don't understand.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.820]   And we get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.300]   and information conservation
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.840]   and a whole bunch of other ideas I talk about in the book.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.420]   So if that's true, if the fundamental theory
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.860]   isn't even local in the sense
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.100]   that an ordinary quantum field theory would be,
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.700]   then we just don't know where to start
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.080]   in terms of getting a classical precursor and quantizing it.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.760]   So the only sensible thing,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.840]   at least the next obvious sensible thing to me
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.600]   would be to say, okay, let's just start intrinsically quantum
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.320]   and work backwards, see if we can find a classical limit.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.760]   - So the idea of locality,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.600]   the fact that locality is not fundamental
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.560]   to the nature of our existence,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.840]   I guess in that sense,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.040]   modeling everything as a field makes sense to me.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640]   Stuff that's close by interacts,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.960]   stuff that's far away doesn't.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.280]   So what's locality and why is it not fundamental?
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.680]   And how is that even possible?
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   - Yeah, I mean, locality is the answer to the question
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.800]   that Isaac Newton was worried about
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.440]   back at the beginning of our conversation, right?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.600]   I mean, how can the earth know
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.920]   what the gravitational field of the sun is?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   And the answer, as spelled out by Laplace and Einstein
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.240]   and others, is that there's a field in between.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360]   And the way a field works is that
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.240]   what's happening to the field at this point in space
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.760]   only depends directly on what's happening
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.720]   at points right next to it.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.040]   But what's happening at those points
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   depends on what's happening right next to those, right?
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.960]   And so you can build up an influence across space
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.220]   through only local interactions.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.520]   That's what locality means.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.000]   What happens here is only affected
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   by what's happening right next to it.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.400]   That's locality.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.920]   The idea of locality is built into every field theory,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.760]   including general relativity as a classical theory.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.960]   It seems to break down when we talk about black holes.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.160]   And Hawking taught us in the 1970s
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   that black holes radiate.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.200]   They give off, they will eventually evaporate away.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.280]   They're not completely black
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.760]   once we take quantum mechanics into account.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.880]   And we think, we don't know for sure,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.800]   but most of us think that if you make a black hole
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.200]   out of certain stuff, then like Laplace's demon taught us,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.280]   you should be able to predict
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.960]   what that black hole will turn into
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.320]   if it's just obeying the Schrodinger equation.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.040]   And if that's true, there are good arguments
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.680]   that can't happen while preserving locality
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.600]   at the same time.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.460]   It's just that the information seems to be spread out
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.860]   non-locally in interesting ways.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.500]   - And people should, you talk about holography
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.520]   with Leonard Susskind on your Mindscape podcast.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.860]   People should listen to it. - Oh yes, I have a podcast.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.780]   I didn't even mention that.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.880]   This is, I'm terrible at--
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.520]   - No, I'm gonna ask you questions about that too.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.680]   And I've been not shutting up about it.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.960]   - It's my favorite science podcast, or not.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.560]   It's not even a science podcast.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.800]   It's like, it's a scientist doing a podcast.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.840]   - That's right, that's what it is, absolutely, yes.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360]   - Yeah, anyway.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.960]   - Yeah, so holography is this idea
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.880]   when you have a black hole,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.200]   and black hole is a region of space
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.240]   inside of which gravity is so strong that you can't escape.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.560]   And there's this weird feature of black holes
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.160]   that, again, is a totally thought experiment feature
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   'cause we haven't gone and probed any yet,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.760]   but there seems to be one way of thinking
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.480]   about what happens inside a black hole
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.200]   as seen by an observer who's falling in,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480]   which is actually pretty normal.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   Everything looks pretty normal
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.640]   until you hit the singularity and you die.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.720]   But from the point of view of the outside observer,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.880]   it seems like all the information that fell in
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.040]   is actually smeared over the horizon in a non-local way.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.080]   And that's puzzling.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.360]   So holography, because that's a two-dimensional surface
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.240]   that is encapsulating the whole three-dimensional
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.000]   thing inside, right?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Still trying to deal with that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.720]   Still trying to figure out how to get there.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.680]   But it's an indication that we need to think
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.840]   a little bit more subtly when we quantize gravity.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   - So because you can describe everything that's going on
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.160]   in three-dimensional space
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.040]   by looking at the two-dimensional projection of it,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   means that locality is not necessary.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.600]   - Well, it means that somehow it's only a good approximation.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.080]   It's not really what's going on.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.480]   - How are we supposed to feel about that?
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.920]   - Supposed to feel liberated.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.400]   (laughing)
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.280]   You know, space is just a good approximation.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.320]   And this was always gonna be true
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.280]   once you started quantizing gravity.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.160]   So we're just beginning now to face up
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.240]   to the dramatic implications of quantizing gravity.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.840]   (upbeat music)
