[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.480]   Today on the show, we're going to talk about capital gains taxes.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.240]   I'm going to give you kind of a mini lesson, a mini lecture on capital gains taxes, and
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   then we're going to focus a good bit on discussing opportunity zones.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.400]   I should have done this episode months ago, and I thank you for your patience with me.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.400]   I should have done this if you remember the three-part series that I did on saving taxes
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.920]   by moving to a no-income tax state, saving taxes by moving outside of the United States,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.600]   saving taxes by moving to Puerto Rico.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.080]   I should have done this episode immediately the next day, but all of the busyness and
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.800]   challenge in my own personal life of a new baby, I simply wasn't prepared to do it.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.480]   So thank you for your patience, but I'm ready to do it now.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.180]   And today I'm going to talk about opportunity zones because opportunity zones are a newly
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.280]   created scheme by the IRS or by the legislators, I guess I should say, out of the 2017 Tax
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520]   Cut and Jobs Act.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.740]   And they are an opportunity for you and for me that could help us to save on capital gains
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.360]   taxes.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.840]   Let's talk a little bit about capital gains taxes first.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.860]   In many ways, capital gains taxes are less offensive to us than ordinary income taxes.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.620]   But in some ways they are harder for us to avoid, which is a real challenge when it comes
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.620]   to planning.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.820]   As I discussed in the three-part series, you can eliminate legally your ordinary income
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.760]   taxes by moving from a certain state by moving to a state that doesn't have ordinary income
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   taxes.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.100]   You can reduce or eliminate your ordinary income taxes on your income by moving outside
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   of the United States.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.900]   And I should specify that this show, especially the opportunity zones, will be exclusively
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.420]   applicable to US persons.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.400]   The first part where I talk about capital gains taxes will be applicable to non-US persons,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.180]   but the second half of the show is exclusively applicable to US persons.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.420]   But US persons can minimize their ordinary income taxes by moving outside of the United
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.500]   States or potentially by moving to Puerto Rico or ultimately by potentially renouncing
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.180]   US citizenship and thus eliminating their burden for US income taxes while also simultaneously
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.980]   eliminating the privilege of being able to live and work inside of the United States.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.300]   But capital gains taxes are a little bit harder to avoid because everybody faces capital gains
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.620]   taxes and they cannot be eliminated by moving outside of the country.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.060]   I actually need to correct something that I did in that series of shows where I erroneously
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.780]   discussed capital gains taxes in conjunction with the foreign tax credit and I stated that
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.940]   you could simply offset your capital gains taxes if you're paying them abroad.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.340]   I was corrected by a reader, sorry, a listener, that I was incorrect in that assessment and
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.260]   I went back and researched it and I was wrong.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.260]   It's much more complex.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.140]   I don't want to go into a detail right now, but just know that I made a mistake in that
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.740]   show about being abroad.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.300]   So with capital gains taxes in general, they're harder for US persons to avoid.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.660]   Now in some ways there are better planning opportunities available for capital gains
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.460]   taxes in order to reduce them and minimize them, etc.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.420]   First of course we can be thankful that capital gains taxes are due at a lower rate than the
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.220]   rate that is assessed on ordinary income as things stand right now, as I record this on
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.380]   July 17, 2019.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.940]   The current capital gains tax rates are generally no higher than about 15% for most people.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.340]   If your overall ordinary income tax bracket is either the 10 or 12%, if your highest marginal
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.940]   bracket is either that 10 or 12% bracket, then some or all of your capital gains might
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.340]   not even be taxed at all, be taxed at a 0% rate.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:46.300]   And then there is a 20% tax rate that comes in when taxpayers hit the 37% ordinary tax
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.940]   rate, which kicks in at about $425,000 of income for a single person, $479,000 for married
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.540]   filing jointly, etc.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.560]   Now there are a couple of other exceptions.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.020]   For example, the most important exception is that sales of some small business stock
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.100]   can be taxed at a 28% rate, sales of collectibles can be taxed at a 28% rate, and there is a
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.180]   25% rate that applies to unrecaptured Section 1250 gain from selling Section 1250 real property.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.700]   But for most of us, we're either in a 15 or 20% capital gains tax rate.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.980]   Now this is really encouraging because it is far more reasonable to owe taxes at 15%
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.020]   than to owe taxes at 50%, at least in my opinion.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.020]   15%?
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.860]   Would I prefer it were 0%?
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.820]   Yeah, but I'm happy to pay taxes for a limited level of government.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.420]   I don't think income taxes make all that much sense.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.860]   I know that the tax revenue has to come somewhere.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.860]   Anything 10% range around that area, I don't think it's such a big deal.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.820]   It's not nearly worth the level of planning and the investment of time and energy and
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.620]   money to get out of when you're dealing with something that's a 10% rate versus a 50% rate.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.480]   But certainly we would like to minimize the amount of taxes that are due.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.620]   So it's good that they're at a lower rate.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.760]   That's a good helpful thing.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.020]   Another thing that's very helpful about capital gains taxes is you have the opportunity to
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.100]   control when those taxes are due.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.980]   That's extremely helpful.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.260]   For example, let's say that you buy a house, a rental house, you rent it out.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.660]   Now when you sell the house, if you realize a capital gain, you are going to pay taxes.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.280]   But you can choose when you sell the house, which means you can choose when you're going
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   to owe that tax.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.920]   So that's another helpful thing about capital gains taxes versus ordinary income taxes.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.820]   It's much harder for you to control when you receive income if you are working than it
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.420]   is when you sell an investment.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Income there are all kinds of rules about when that income is going to be recognized.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.260]   You can defer some of it.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.980]   We just talked in the most recent show about yes, you can defer some of it into a 401k,
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.420]   thus deferring the tax liability for a long period of time.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.780]   But now the law may change so that now it's got to come out within 10 years of your death,
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.060]   whereas previously you could defer it for longer.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.500]   So we're always subject to rules as far as when you defer it.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.740]   But with your own asset, you can choose when you buy it and when you sell it.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.620]   No one can force you to sell an asset that has an embedded tax liability.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.380]   So that's very, very helpful with capital gains.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.740]   Capital gains assets can also often be capital gains taxes can also often be deferred with
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.960]   the like kind exchange rules.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.660]   This is especially applicable in things like real estate or real property where you can
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.780]   defer the asset.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.340]   For example, you could buy a rental house today for $100,000.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.900]   It grows in value for $200,000.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.660]   You have $100,000 value in the asset, $100,000 of gain that would be taxed when you sell
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.660]   it.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:55.340]   But if you do a like kind exchange and exchange your $200,000 of rental property for a different
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.820]   rental property, you can defer that tax and you can actually do this through your entire
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.820]   lifetime.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.900]   You can do this with life insurance.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.900]   You can do this with annuities.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.260]   You can do this with real estate.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.340]   You can do it with some forms of tangible property and you can avoid the tax for a serious, an
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.540]   extensive amount of time.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.140]   That's very, very useful.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.420]   It's also useful if you can have an asset that you can then borrow on.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:23.040]   For example, real estate investors routinely will defer the payment of their tax by doing
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.980]   a like kind exchange.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.100]   And then in order to access money from their investment, they'll put a loan on the property.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.740]   And because real estate loans are at such a modest interest rate, it's a very efficient
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.740]   plan.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.500]   The interest is deductible.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.820]   It's a modest interest rate.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:46.780]   It's a very safe asset so that an investor who sells the $200,000 property can invest
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:53.260]   it into another property worth $400,000 and then pick up a $400,000 mortgage on that property,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.100]   thus realizing a huge amount of money in their bank account that they can spend, but they
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.300]   have no taxable income because they've used a loan instead of a sale.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.500]   So they haven't sold the property and spent the money because that would incur the tax.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.940]   What they've done is they've taken a loan and money that you receive in the form of
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.260]   a loan is not taxable income.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.700]   Then over time, they let their tenants pay off the debt and the tenants pay it off.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.740]   The interest is deductible along the way.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.460]   It's at a very modest interest rate and it works out pretty well.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.700]   It's a pretty efficient system.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.420]   You can do the same thing with something like life insurance.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.580]   That's why you can access, if you have a lot of gain in a life insurance policy, you can
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.620]   take a loan against the cash values, the gain inside of a life insurance policy, and that's
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.380]   not taxable income to you because it's a loan on an asset.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.700]   Whereas if you did cash out the policy, you sold the policy or cashed it out, then of
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.860]   course you would be realizing income, which would be taxable.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.220]   And the big disadvantage of life insurance is in that situation, it would be taxable
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.720]   as ordinary income, not even at the more favorable capital gains rates.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.900]   So capital gains taxes are relatively simple for you to control.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.220]   And through tools like a like-kind exchange, you have the ability to defer the payment
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.740]   of those taxes until the future.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:12.380]   Then you also have some benefits of capital gains assets if you hold them until your death.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.540]   Most importantly, all most, I try not to say, I should say most, because maybe I'm just
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.380]   not thinking of something right now, but most capital gains tax, sorry, capital, capital
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:30.100]   assets, if you hold them until death can then receive a step up in tax basis by your beneficiaries,
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.300]   thus eliminating the tax due as long as we don't run afoul of estate tax rates.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:41.320]   So the way this works, you own a, you own a rental property, you buy that rental property
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.980]   for $200,000, but you continue to own it for your entire lifetime.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.100]   Perhaps you take a loan against it, spend the money, that's up to you, but you own it
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.460]   for your entire lifetime.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.660]   Then when you die, that property is worth $1 million, but you leave that $1 million
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.540]   property to your children, your child.
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.300]   Well, your child will inherit that property and at the date of your death, that property
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.060]   will have a new tax basis assigned to it, which will be the value of the property at
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060]   the date of your death.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.420]   So let's say that value is $1 million.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.700]   Your child keeps the property for a couple more years and sells it for $1,100,000.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.620]   What would happen in this circumstance is your child would only owe in capital gains
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:33.060]   tax on the $100,000 of income, the $100,000 of gain from the date of death until the date
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.460]   of sale.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:41.540]   The $800,000 of gain that you had embedded in the property would be wiped away by death,
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.820]   by the step up in tax basis.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.980]   So this can work out really well.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.820]   It's why when you're doing estate planning, you need to be really careful about what assets
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.300]   get sold and when.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:55.740]   I have seen major tax bills from people who didn't thoughtfully approach their tax planning
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.260]   on their assets.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.580]   If you have that $1 million property with a $200,000 tax basis in it, I would much rather
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.580]   see you keep it and take a half million dollar loan against it or a million dollar loan against
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.060]   it, it doesn't matter, to fund your needs than to see you sell it and have to pay capital
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.360]   gains taxes on $800,000 of gain if you just want to leave it and let your kids sell it.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.220]   So appreciated assets, appreciated capital assets are usually good assets to leave behind
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.260]   to your children.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.220]   And if you understood the flow of that logic, you can see why now there is much more value,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.940]   especially if the rules do change in the future about the heritability of IRAs and the ability
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:44.600]   to do a stretch IRA, you can now see why we would start to walk away from the value of
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:51.020]   leaving behind IRAs for children and go back to the value of capital assets because we
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:57.080]   can completely eliminate the capital gains tax due by having your property receive that
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.600]   step up in tax basis at death.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.760]   So these are some common ways, common and ordinary ways of dealing with capital gains
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.580]   taxes for US persons.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.820]   But beyond these, there aren't a lot of ways to save, there aren't a lot of ways where
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   you can lower it all that much.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.140]   I think again, most people just have 15%, usually 20%, it's not so egregious and they
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.500]   just deal with it.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:28.780]   But still, you're fairly limited and there aren't a lot of other things.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.660]   These are the basic tools that are in a tool chest that I've just described to you.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:41.380]   Well in come the concepts related to opportunity zones and this is fundamentally new, which
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.700]   is why it's important for us to discuss.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:52.460]   An opportunity zone was, opportunity zones were created by the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   Act.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:59.140]   It took a while for them to be phased in because all of the different states had to respond
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.740]   with where in their states were actually going to be the opportunity, the designated opportunity
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.740]   zones.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:11.420]   But let me describe first what the benefits are of your investing in an opportunity zone
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.860]   and I'll go back and explain a few more details with as far as what defines an opportunity
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.660]   zone and how to find out where it is.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:26.720]   Basically an opportunity zone is a certain district or a certain geographic area, a census
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:36.300]   tract that qualifies as needing additional capital to be infused into it.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:42.380]   So the definitions by the Internal Revenue Code, an opportunity zone has to have a poverty
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:50.140]   rate of at least 20% or it has to be a place that has a median family income of no more
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:56.580]   than 80% of the statewide median family income for census tracts within non-metropolitan areas
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:02.260]   or no more than 80% of the greater statewide median family income or the overall metropolitan
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.980]   median family income for census tracts within metropolitan areas.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.340]   So these are the basic requirements.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:16.620]   Then according to the law, up to 25% of the census tracts of each jurisdiction that met
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:23.020]   these criteria could be nominated and an additional 5% of each jurisdiction could qualify if it
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.480]   met a different set of income or geographic qualifications.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.420]   So the details are not important.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.860]   The thing is just simply to know that these are economically depressed or economically
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.460]   disadvantaged or not economically productive zones.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:44.260]   And the idea is can we incentivize investors to go into these places and start new businesses,
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.860]   invest in new things if we incentivize them by saving on taxes.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:56.220]   And so let's discuss carefully what you save on with taxes because this is very important
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   and it could be a huge opportunity for some of you to save a significant amount of money.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:09.160]   There are potentially three layers of tax benefits if you will invest in an opportunity
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.040]   zone, if you'll make an investment in an opportunity zone.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:22.380]   The first thing is if you sell assets and realize a capital gain that would ordinarily
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:32.580]   be a taxable capital gain, you can defer paying that capital gain tax on those earnings until
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:41.020]   April 2027 if you can hold these investments through December 31, 2026.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.300]   So this is important.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:52.300]   First, if you have an asset and you sell it and realize a capital gain today, if you invest
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:17:01.780]   that money, that capital gain into an opportunity zone, you can defer the taxes that you owe.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:13.160]   The second benefit is if you hold your opportunity zone investment for at least five years prior
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:23.380]   to December 31, 2026, you can reduce the tax liability that you owe on that deferred capital
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.680]   gain by 10%.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:34.940]   If you hold the investment for a minimum of seven years prior to December 31, 2026, the
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.480]   tax liability can be reduced by 15% total.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.820]   So the first benefit was that you could defer paying the taxes and that has a substantial
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.300]   benefit which we'll talk more about in a moment.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:54.040]   The second benefit is you can reduce the taxes that you owe by potentially 10% or 15% but
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.240]   in this case 10% because we're pretty close here to that seven year mark.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.460]   Yeah, we're over it now.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.460]   So you can reduce your tax due by 10%.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.680]   That's the second benefit.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.800]   And then the third thing is if you make an investment in an opportunity zone and you
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:21.440]   hold that investment for at least 10 years, then you can expect to pay no capital gains
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:29.960]   taxes on any appreciation in the opportunity zone investment if you hold it for at least
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   10 years.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.320]   You qualify for a permanent exclusion from the capital gains tax.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.760]   That's for an investment that's made in the opportunity zone.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.080]   Now let me give you a little bit of texture as to how valuable these particular benefits
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.120]   are because they could be very substantially very, very beneficial.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:19:01.080]   Let's assume for analysis that you have an asset that has a $1 million embedded gain,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   a capital gain.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.660]   You have a $1 million capital gain in an asset.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.000]   This can be stocks that you own, real estate, business, doesn't matter.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.520]   Any kind of capital gain asset, $1 million.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.560]   Let's assume that you're going to be taxed on that $1 million at a 15% long term capital
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.160]   gains rate.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.120]   So that means that you have a tax liability of $150,000.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.400]   If you sell your asset and realize your $1 million of gain today, then you'll owe the
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.680]   IRS a check for $150,000 today.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.760]   Well if you want to participate in an opportunity zone, here's how the numbers would work.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:42.560]   The first thing that you can do is you can sell the asset and then you have 180 days
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.320]   to buy something else, to buy something that qualifies in an opportunity zone.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.520]   This can be to start a business, it can be to buy real estate, there are a number of
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   different investments that it could be.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.920]   It could be even a fund, an opportunity fund, a fund that's being managed by somebody else.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   But you invest your $1 million into an opportunity zone investment.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.560]   And we're going to assume that you maximize this program by holding things the maximum
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.200]   period of time.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.680]   The first thing that you will save is you will be able to defer the tax until the year
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.400]   April, until 2027, until April 2027.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:27.080]   That deferral means that the tax that you owe could be substantially reduced based upon
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.680]   the time value of money, especially based upon inflation and the effects of that.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.080]   And also reduced by your being able to use the money yourself.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.240]   So basically, instead of sending the $150,000 to the IRS this April, you get to wait seven
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.640]   years, yeah, seven years to send it to the IRS.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.480]   Well, what is that worth?
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.440]   Potentially if you could invest the money, a lot.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:58.760]   So $150,000 that you can invest today, starting with a present value of $150,000 for seven
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   years.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.920]   Let's say that you could just invest that into something, if you had the chance, you
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.520]   would don't because it's an opportunity zone.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.120]   But let's just for the sake of comparison, say that you're investing it at 3% per year,
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   no payments on it.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.820]   Well, at the end of seven years, that's potentially $184,000.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.560]   So you now have more money that you can use to pay the IRS.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   You have a little bit of extra.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.920]   Instead of them taking the money and earning interest on it, you've been able to take the
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.840]   money and earn interest on it.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.600]   Now additionally, you have the fact that inflation will be trucking away, reducing the value
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.540]   of the tax liability that you owe the IRS.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:42.440]   If we use the same math, the same $150,000, let's assume that the value of that $150,000
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.280]   is being reduced by inflation and we do 3% for seven years.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.700]   That means that in seven years, when you owe the tax, you're going to have to owe what
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:58.260]   in today's dollars you would need only $121,197 to pay because the value of the 150 in seven
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.480]   years at 3% inflation would drop to be 121.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.920]   Now we don't know exactly what would happen with inflation, but it could be, you know,
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.780]   3% is not an unreasonable number to use.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:15.480]   So you can invest the money and earn benefit from it and you can pay the money back in
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.960]   the future with inflated dollars, which goes farther.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.480]   That's pretty significant.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.840]   That could be very, very significant for some of you because now you have an additional,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.120]   basically you have an additional $150,000 of investment capital that you can deploy
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.400]   into an opportunity zone business.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.480]   So that deals with the first one.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.880]   Depending on the amount of capital gains that you have, that could be extremely substantial.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.080]   If you add $10 million of capital gains and you went ahead and realized that $10 million
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:56.040]   of capital gains and you could take the $1.5 million that you owed and invest it into an
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.480]   opportunity, you know, invest the whole thing into an opportunity zone, but avoid paying
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.440]   the $1.5 million of tax, we're talking big numbers here, big opportunity.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   So if you have capital gains assets, you should seriously consider it.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.600]   What's the second benefit of it?
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.120]   Well, the second benefit of it is that 10% reduction in value.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.740]   So not only do you in the future get to pay back your taxes with inflated dollars instead
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:24.780]   of today's dollars, now you get to have the total tax bill reduced by 10% if you hold
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.140]   the investment for at least five years.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:34.000]   So that lops off back to our $150,000 example, that lops off $15,000 from the tax bill.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.240]   So in essence, now we had our tax bill of $150,000 dropped to $121,000 due to paying
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.360]   it back with inflated dollars.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.660]   And then from $121,000, we can drop off another $15,000 due to the 10% discount.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.280]   And now our total tax bill that we're going to owe is $106,000.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.060]   Not bad.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.500]   Pretty substantial, depending on what happens with that inflation expectation.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.660]   Lowered our tax bill by a third from $150,000 to $106,000.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.660]   That's good.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.920]   Now then the third benefit is potentially very, very large.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:15.140]   And that is the fact that your investment that you make in the opportunity zone, if
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:24.180]   you hold it for at least 10 years, it qualifies from permanent exclusion from capital gains
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.020]   taxes.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.980]   So if you buy a million dollar investment, and that over the course of 10 years, you're
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:36.340]   able to force some kind of significant appreciation in your investment, some kind of significant
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:45.020]   change and go from $1 million to $5 million in value, you now can avoid paying the capital
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:52.340]   gains on the $4 million of gain, which at a 15% rate would be a $600,000 savings as
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.620]   long as you hold it for 10 years.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.340]   Those are the tax benefits of investing in an opportunity zone.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.940]   This could be substantial for the right set of facts.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:11.580]   Now if you don't have any assets that have any significant gains built into them, then
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:17.020]   your benefit for this would be limited to the appreciation and the benefit to defer
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.300]   capital gains on your opportunity zone investment.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.180]   You can still participate.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.580]   You just won't get the benefit of saving on the embedded capital gains that you already
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.360]   have in your portfolio.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.540]   But this could work out.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.940]   You have money in a checking account, you go and instead of choosing to buy a house
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.740]   that's outside of an economic opportunity zone, you buy a house that's inside of an
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.740]   opportunity zone.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.380]   Well, if you can make a substantial increase in the value of it, you can have that capital
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.020]   gain tax-free.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.100]   But this really applies to those of you who have embedded gains.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:55.060]   If you have an asset that has embedded gains, this is well worth your considering selling
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:02.620]   it and investing in a qualified opportunity zone in order to save on the gains that you
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.620]   have now.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.060]   It's unlikely that there's going to be a better thing coming in the next few years.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.260]   As I record this, again, July of 2019, I think this is a good time for you to look at your
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.700]   portfolio and consider your assets.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.820]   Stock market values are historically high at the moment, which means that it's very
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:28.220]   possible that you may have some very significant gains in certain stocks that you own.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:34.540]   Real estate markets for most of us throughout the United States are significantly high at
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.860]   the moment, which means that you may have some real estate that would be worth selling
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.300]   and resetting in some way.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.580]   There are other interesting markets that are high.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:50.020]   For example, you may be a cryptocurrency investor and you might have significant embedded gains
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:57.300]   in one of your cryptocurrencies that can qualify under this scheme as well.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.620]   So the key thing is look at your portfolio and think about whether or not you have something,
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.940]   you have some kind of gain that you would like to go ahead and use in this particular
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.620]   scheme.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:19.300]   Here are the specific rules from the legislation that qualify a certain gain for the investment
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.740]   into an opportunity zone.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.740]   First, the gain is treated as a capital gain for federal income tax purposes.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.980]   If so, it's eligible for deferral.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.460]   It has to meet all three of these conditions.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.860]   Number one, the gain is treated as a capital gain for federal income tax purposes.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:41.220]   Number two, it would be otherwise recognized before January 1, 2027, if not applying for
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.820]   deferral, which means you would otherwise get it from the sale of the asset.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.980]   And number three, it does not arise from the sale or exchange with a related property.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:58.020]   So this can include short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains, net section 1231
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.660]   gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.660]   Doesn't matter.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.220]   All your gains will retain their identification, are they short-term, long-term, long-term
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.800]   for the entire portion of the deferral.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.940]   So you can see here how, depending on the specific asset, it could be even more significant
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.940]   of savings for you.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.420]   For example, let's say that you're selling some collectible or short-term capital gain
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:28.820]   asset that can qualify and your rate would be higher than 15%, thus making all the math
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.140]   that I did even more beneficial.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.300]   Or perhaps you're in a 20% rate plus the 3.8% Medicare surcharge tax.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.620]   So you have a 23.8% tax on your long-term capital gains, qualifies, and all of it would
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.980]   be saved.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.620]   Then you have to invest it.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.140]   You have to identify an investment and invest the money into an appropriate opportunity
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.620]   zone investment within 180 days of your realizing the capital gain.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.420]   So let's talk about what your options are.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.620]   You can do this directly or you can participate into an opportunity fund.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:06.200]   The legislation specifically allows for the creation of qualified opportunity funds.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.100]   And these qualified opportunity funds are being developed now.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.300]   They are available now.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.060]   I'm not going to name any names or discuss that.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:22.020]   It's easily available to you with a search of the appropriate internet and resources.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.180]   But they are there and you can invest in an appropriate qualified opportunity fund.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.700]   So you don't have to be the active manager.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.460]   You don't have to be the one specifically identifying the investments.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.180]   You can pay a manager by investing in a qualified opportunity fund and you'll retain all of
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.620]   your tax benefits.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:46.140]   You will notify the IRS of your investment using tax form 8949 and your schedule D when
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.140]   it comes time to file this year's taxes or whenever you do this.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.980]   And then when the taxes become due in the long term, then you'll pay those taxes.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.780]   And then you will, again, as long as you hold the investment for the 10 years, you can potentially
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.700]   eliminate your capital gains tax liability from whatever appreciation you can earn from
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.780]   your quality opportunity funds investment.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.980]   A couple of interesting questions to discuss, some frequently asked questions.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:16.500]   First, there are opportunity zones in every state and I think it's a total of two zones
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.940]   that were added late last year in Puerto Rico.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.700]   So you can also do this in Puerto Rico, which could, and potentially if you're using Puerto
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.140]   Rico to improve your tax situation like we discussed in the show on Puerto Rico, it's
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:35.500]   possible that you can additionally do this in Puerto Rico and use that as a part of your
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.580]   overall planning structure.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.620]   So it's worth your considering there.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:45.140]   But there are opportunity zones and funds in every single state.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.220]   And some of these areas are very interesting.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.180]   There are places out in the country, there are places right in the middle of the city.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.740]   Now you will have to look up easily findable online.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.620]   You can look up one of the maps and see where the funds are.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.160]   You can find the lists of the ones that are in your state.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.980]   There's no requirement that you invest in your state of residence.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.840]   You can invest in any state.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.580]   So if you want to invest in California or you want to invest in Mississippi, there are
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.020]   opportunities in each and every state.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.740]   All of these tracks, the census tracks are designated.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.860]   They've been identified by your state government.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.300]   Everything has been done and is available.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.980]   So take a look around the map, take a look at some of the lists and see if there are
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.180]   anything, any opportunities that are interesting to you.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.560]   If you're starting a business, you should or think that you're going to be starting
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.980]   a business, you should seriously consider locating that business in one of these opportunity
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:39.660]   zones so that it qualifies for this potential exclusion on capital gains.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.820]   There are a number of questions that are associated with exactly how to do this, but you can do
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.820]   it.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.340]   So if you're starting a business, and especially you should consider this if you're starting
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:54.760]   a business that has the potential for a massive growth in capital value, you should consider
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.420]   locating it within a qualified opportunity zone.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.300]   Many people look first at real estate, but I don't think, I think there's opportunities,
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.780]   there are opportunities there clearly, but I don't think that should be the primary opportunity.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.260]   I think the biggest opportunity with any kind of tax scheme like this is if you're involved
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.740]   in something where there is huge upside potential.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.140]   So if you're doing a tech startup or you're doing some kind of business that has the potential
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:25.380]   for a massive level of appreciation, think carefully about locating yourself and qualifying
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.780]   yourself as a qualified opportunity zone business.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.740]   I think that's everything I really want to cover in this particular show.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.140]   There are a number of questions that I could imagine being asked, there are plenty of things,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.620]   details, but I think I'd like to keep this show just focused on the big picture idea
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.260]   and simply close by telling you this.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.980]   There are a few things that are genuinely new and as they come along, things change.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.460]   In the most recent show, I talked about the change of something that's been around for
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:58.340]   decades and hasn't changed yet, but it potentially could change and how utterly devastating that
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.340]   is.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.340]   But this is the flip side.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.820]   This is a change that potentially you could use and I think this is the kind of thing
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.300]   with the kind of scale that I feel is, it's the kind of scheme that I think I would be
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.620]   confident in participating in because it's of a short enough timeline.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.020]   It's clearly specified enough that this one should work out.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:25.100]   It's not just a long open-ended promise, a naked promise to pay kind of thing from the
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.100]   government.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:32.460]   This is of a specific period of time and so I think this can work out.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.140]   This is fundamentally new.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.580]   So this is not in last year's textbooks, this is fundamentally new and it is fundamentally
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.380]   a potential for you that could be very, very significant.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.860]   So if you qualify, if you want to start a new business, do make some new investments,
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.300]   look to do those things in an opportunity zone.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.780]   If you have assets that have high embedded capital gains, if it's a good time to sell
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.100]   those assets and if you'd like the potential to save on your capital gains taxes, potentially
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.420]   up to a third or so of the money that you're going to owe the IRS, this could be one way
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.740]   to do it and I hope that this helps you to save money.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:14.160]   I guess I'll just close with an ad to say this is a good time and a good thing to consider
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:20.220]   as you make your own adjustments in your life to pursue your vision of whatever financial
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:25.460]   independence and financial freedom looks like and means to you.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.700]   And I would invite you to consider purchasing any of my courses that may help you with some
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.700]   of these.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:36.660]   But for example, let's say that you are interested in moving from a place that has, you're interested
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.940]   in starting a new business.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:45.840]   Well, by moving to a place that is located within an economic opportunity zone, you could
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.440]   potentially have a decrease in your overall living expenses.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.800]   That could be helpful to you because these are considered to be less wealthy, more struggling
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   areas.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.680]   So you can move in, you could potentially find a place to live that cost you less and
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.360]   you could be part of a community revitalization in that process.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.280]   And while you're at it, you can build your new business and enjoy some of the benefits
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.520]   of the removal of capital gains taxes on that new business.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.560]   So this is the type of thing that could allow you to have just one more benefit along the
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.560]   way.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.440]   And when you start stacking all these benefits, that's where you get the really great opportunities.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.480]   Let's say that real estate prices are high in your area right now, you go ahead and sell
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   your house.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.320]   Well, you have some tax-free money there from the sale of your house and you can move to
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.720]   a place that's cheaper, perhaps a place that's safer than where you live now, although that
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:41.280]   you should be careful there with regard to the overall, you know, what you're moving
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.280]   into.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.000]   And for context there, these are based on census tracts.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.160]   So some of these places are geographically huge and some of them are geographically tiny.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.040]   If you go to the economic opportunity zones that are located in New York City, it's a
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.480]   geographically tiny part of the world.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.720]   If you go to one of the economic opportunity zones that's located in Wyoming, it's geographically
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   huge.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.520]   So consider that in your movements.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.640]   But this could be a way for you to get multiple benefits.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   That's my point.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.560]   Consider purchasing some of my courses, see if any of them help you out.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.080]   I've got three available for sale right now at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.920]   I have a guide to career and income planning.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.720]   Why not go and get a dream job, start a dream business while you're at it?
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.880]   I have a guide to how to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.240]   Why not move someplace safe?
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.160]   Why not move someplace that you want to be and put down some roots?
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:34.720]   Why not establish yourself in a place that is economically has more potential for the
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.840]   future?
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.640]   It might seem strange to say we have to move to an economic opportunity zone, but you know
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.960]   as well as I knew, I know, that any kind of official system like this is going to have
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.720]   inefficiencies in it where you can find a wonderful place within an economic opportunity
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   zone.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.000]   And so that could be helpful to you as well to set up a place that will insulate you from
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.720]   the potential for economic crisis.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:03.440]   And then also of course I have how to borrow money and never pay interest and do it safely
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.960]   using credit cards, which is probably my favorite course to help people have access to capital
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.520]   in a safe way when they need it for things like this.
