[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.480]   75,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.500]   75,
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.720]   75, I was incorrect in that assessment.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.460]   I went back and researched it and I was wrong.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.500]   It's much more complex.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.800]   I don't want to go into a detail right now,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.940]   but just know that I made a mistake in that show about being abroad.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.200]   So with capital gains taxes in general,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.480]   they're harder for US persons to avoid.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.940]   Now, in some ways,
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.480]   there are better planning opportunities available for capital gains taxes in order to reduce them and minimize them, etc.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:26.580]   in the future.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.640]   So,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.440]   if you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.500]   then you're going to have to make a decision.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   if you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to do that,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you're going to be in a situation where you're not going to do that, that, that's a very important thing.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.380]   New

[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.540]   The important exception is that sales of some small business stock can be taxed at a 28% rate, sales of collectibles can be taxed at a 28% rate, and there is a 25% rate that applies to unrecaptured Section 1250 gain from selling Section 1250 real property. But for most of us, we're either in a 15% or 20% capital gains tax rate. Now, this is really encouraging because it is far more reasonable to owe taxes at 15% or 20%.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   I don't think income taxes make all that much sense. I know that the tax revenue has to come somewhere. Anything, you know, 10% range around that area, I don't think it's such a big deal. It's not nearly worth the level of planning and the investment of time and energy and money to get out of when you're dealing with something that's at a 10% rate versus a 50% rate.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   It's not nearly worth the level of planning and the investment of time and energy and money to get out of when you're dealing with something that's at a 10% rate versus a 50% rate.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   It's not nearly worth the level of planning and the investment of time and energy and money to get out of when you're dealing with something that's at a 10% rate versus a 50% rate.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:27.580]  ,
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   But certainly, we would like to minimize the amount of taxes that are due.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   So, it's good that they're at a lower rate.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   That's a good helpful thing.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   Another thing that's very helpful about capital gains taxes is you have the opportunity to control when those taxes are due.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   That's extremely helpful.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   When, for example, let's say that you buy a house, a rental house, you rent it out. Now, when you sell the house, if you realize a capital gain, you are going to pay taxes. But you can choose when you sell the house, you are going to pay taxes.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   You can choose when you sell the house, you are going to pay taxes.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   You can choose when you sell the house, you are going to pay taxes.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   Which means you can choose when you're going to owe that tax.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.640]   That's another helpful thing about capital gains taxes versus ordinary income taxes.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:42.820]   It's much harder for you to control when you receive income, if you are working, than it is when you sell an investment.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.460]   Income, there are all kinds of rules about when that income is going to be recognized.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.940]   You can defer some of it.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:56.580]   We just talked in the most recent show about, yes, you can defer some of it into a 401k, thus deferring the tax liability for a long period of time.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.600]   But now, the law says you can defer some of it into a 401k.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   You can defer some of it into a 401k.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   You can defer some of it into a 401k.

[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   We're talking big numbers here,
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   big opportunity.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   So if you have capital gains assets,
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   So if you have capital gains assets,
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   you should seriously consider it.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   So if you have capital gains assets,
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   you should seriously consider it.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   What's the second benefit of it?
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   Well, the second benefit of it is that 10% reduction in value.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   So not only do you in the future get to pay back your taxes with inflated dollars instead of today's dollars, now you get to have the total tax bill reduced by 10% if you hold the investment for at least five years. So that lops off back to our $150,000 example
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   So that lops off back to our $150,000 example
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   that lops off back to our $150,000 example
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   that lops off back to our $150,000 example
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:50.380]   15,000 dollars from the tax bill.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.480]   So in essence now we had our tax bill of 150 dropped to 121 due to paying it back with inflated dollars and then from 121, we can drop off another $15,000 due to the 10% discount and now our total tax bill that we're going to owe is $106,000. Not bad. Pretty substantial, but depending on what happens with that inflation expectation.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.280]   Lowered our tax bill by a third from 150 to 120,000.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   Lowered our tax bill by a third from 150 to 120,000.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   That's good.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   Now then the third benefit is potentially very, very large and that is the fact that your investment that you make in the Opportunity Zone.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   If you hold it for at least 10 years, it qualifies from permanent exclusion from capital gains taxes.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   So if you buy a million-dollar investment and that over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   It qualifies from permanent exclusion from capital gains taxes.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   So if you buy a million-dollar investment and that over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   So if you buy a million-dollar investment and that over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   It qualifies from permanent exclusion from capital gains taxes.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   So if you buy a million-dollar investment and that over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   it qualifies from permanent exclusion from capital gains taxes.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   So if you buy a million-dollar investment and that over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:58.320]   and that over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   you're able to force some kind of significant appreciation in your investment, some kind of significant change and go from $1 million to $5 million in value, you now can avoid paying the capital gains on the $4 million of gain which at a 15% rate would be a $600 savings as long as you hold it for 10 years. Those are the tax benefits of investing in an Opportunity Zone.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   So if you buy a million-dollar investment and that over the course of 10 years, you can avoid paying the capital gains on the $4 million of gain which at a 15% rate would be a $600 savings as long as long as you hold it for 10 years.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.320]  , those are the tax benefits of investing in an Opportunity Zone.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   This could be substantial for the right set of facts.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   This could be substantial for the right set of facts.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   Now, if you don't have any assets that have any significant gains built into them,
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   Then your benefit for this would be limited to the appreciation and the benefit to defer capital gains on your Opportunity Zone investment.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You can still participate.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You just won't get the benefit of saving on the embedded capital gains that you already have in your portfolio.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   But this could work out.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You have the opportunity to invest in an Opportunity Zone.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You can still participate.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You just won't get the benefit of saving on the embedded capital gains that you already have in your portfolio.
