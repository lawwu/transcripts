[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Here's the new Pixel 6 Pro from Google.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.840]   You're now seeing the result of it running a computationally intensive neural network
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.440]   in real time that I put on there for testing purposes.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.040]   It's using TensorFlow Lite and the new Tensor chip that is optimized for AI.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.320]   I am unboxing this AI because as a robotics and AI person, I'm interested in seeing how
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   innovation in AI hardware and software is increasingly taking over the smartphone space.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.440]   Also, unboxing AI makes me think of Pandora's box, the myth that serves as the metaphor
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.960]   for the mystery and the power of AI.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.760]   I know this is just a phone, but let's pause for a second to think.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.460]   This computer has over 200,000 times the processing power of the computer that first landed humans
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.180]   on the moon and over 2 million times the RAM.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.120]   We are engineering our way to superhuman intelligence one phone at a time.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:12.160]   One small step for phone and soon enough, one giant leap for a hybrid of machine and
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.360]   mankind.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.000]   Let's talk about the specs.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.520]   Here's the comparison of the Pixel 6 to the Pixel 6 Pro across various specs, highlighting
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.320]   what to me are the key differences in yellow and in green, what are the key similarities.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.400]   Key differences, $300 in price.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.800]   Also the Pixel 6 Pro has a slightly higher display, slightly higher resolution and a
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.080]   120 hertz refresh rate versus the 90 hertz refresh rate.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.800]   Though honestly, I've been using both phones for almost a week now and I don't feel any
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   difference between them.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.800]   The key similarity to me on the AI and the computational side is that they both have
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   the same SoC system on a chip, the Google Tensor.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.720]   To me, the RAM and storage are very important, but once you get to a certain threshold, it
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   really doesn't matter.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.680]   12 gigabytes feels the same as 8 gigabytes and the same goes for the storage.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.720]   Both phones have a 50 megapixel wide angle.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   Now that produces a 12 megapixel image because Google combines the 2x2 pixel groups into
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.120]   single effective pixel to cut noise and improve color and dynamic range.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.280]   There's also the 12 megapixel ultra wide that's used to decrease noise for both the photos
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.880]   and the videos.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.040]   And the Pro has a 48 megapixel telephoto lens, which results in one key difference, I think.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.200]   It provides a 4x optical zoom plus a 20x digital zoom via machine learning via their super
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.160]   resolution algorithm.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.720]   The rest to me is pretty much the same.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.500]   Both phones feel amazing in my hand, but of course, me being who I am, I care mostly about
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.480]   what's on the inside, and that's the Google Tensor.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600]   Now let's talk about the Tensor chip.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.920]   My main flagship phone for machine learning applications this year has been the Samsung
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, pictured here with the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.400]   The Galaxy Brain is powered by Snapdragon 888.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.860]   The Pixel Brain is powered by the new Tensor chip.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.240]   Both are truly amazing machines.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.260]   I think AI innovation in both hardware and software will be what matters in flagship
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.480]   smartphones over the next decade.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.800]   This is where the battle is.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.440]   Let's now look at the details of the technical specs of the Tensor system on a chip and also
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.960]   the philosophical vision behind its architecture.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.760]   The key components of the architecture of the Tensor system on a chip are the CPUs,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.920]   the GPU, ISP, TPU, Context Hub, and the Titan M2.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.840]   Depending on the application, various components of this chip can be used at the same time,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.280]   leading to what Google is calling heterogeneous computing.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.800]   For the CPU, there's two big CPU cores with the Cortex-X1, there's two medium CPU cores
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.600]   with the A76, and there's four small CPU cores with the A55.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.960]   This is in contrast with the most common design for the flagships, which is one big Cortex-X1
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   and four and three medium A78 cores.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   It's funny that Google says that having one big CPU core is good for benchmarks but not
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.680]   good for the experience.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.520]   It's funny because, as you'll see in the benchmarks, the Pixel 6 actually performs really well
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   on the single core Geekbench 5 test.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.760]   Performance-wise, the benefit of having two Cortex-X1s is that you can distribute a thermal
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.480]   budget across them so there's less overheating on intensive tasks like 4K 60fps video.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.360]   So in initial tests, there's a lot less overheating, so you'll be able to shoot video for much
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   longer.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.720]   Besides the CPUs, there's the GPU, there's an upgrade in that.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.280]   There's the ISP, Image Signal Processor, that's optimized for image and video processing in
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.520]   terms of machine learning.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.040]   And then there's the more general machine learning engine, that's the Tensor Processing
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   Unit.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.920]   The Geekbench 6 Hub does ultra-low power ambient computing, and the Titan M2 does hardware
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   security.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.880]   Like I said, I've been using the Galaxy S21 Ultra with the Snapdragon 888 for many months
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.680]   now, and so it's nice to take a look at some benchmarks for the CPU, GPU, and NPU for these
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.000]   two flagship chips.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.080]   Now the big caveat here, as you probably know, is that benchmarks often don't reflect real-life
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.520]   performance so arguably they don't actually matter.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.680]   But the main takeaway story here is that these are both amazing chips.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.520]   In Geekbench 5 CPU benchmark, Pixel 6 outperforms the Galaxy S21 on single-core tests, and the
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   Galaxy S21 outperforms Pixel 6 on the multi-core tests.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.840]   For the Geekbench machine learning benchmark, the Snapdragon wins on the CPU and the GPU,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.880]   and the Pixel 6 wins on the NPU.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.660]   The Geekbench machine learning benchmark, by the way, uses TensorFlow Lite.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.080]   And there's also the AI Benchmark 4 that's specialized for machine learning.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.480]   It runs a huge number of different neural networks on the devices, and there, once again,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.920]   Pixel 6 far outperforms Galaxy S21.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.320]   In fact, it leads every other smartphone on the current AI Benchmark 4 leaderboard.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.360]   Again, I think the takeaway here in terms of benchmarks is that Pixel 6 does well on
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.420]   machine learning tasks, and Snapdragon does well on CPU/GPU-centric tasks.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.740]   But they're both, again, incredible machines.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.940]   I think the important thing here is what does this heterogeneous computing enable in terms
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.800]   of software features?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.720]   And the Pixel 6 provides a huge number of seamlessly integrated machine learning algorithms,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.040]   increasing the vibrancy of the color with the HDR+ for the images and HDR-Net for the
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.120]   video, improving the accuracy and the efficiency of the face detection, again, both for images
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.680]   and video.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.200]   And then there's just a huge number of cool features like face unblur motion mode that
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   adds blur to moving objects.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.560]   There's the magic eraser that's actually shown here on screen, where you can select certain
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.880]   parts of the object.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.360]   They can be removed and then intelligently filled based on what the background is.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.760]   Then for images, there's real tone that's looking at skin color, making sure this shows
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.160]   up looking great on photos.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.280]   Honestly, the video is where the fun is.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.360]   Like I said, HDR-Net, that's an incredible use of neural networks.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.040]   I actually personally think super resolution algorithms are one of the coolest applications
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.440]   of computer vision in terms of its maybe simplicity and usefulness and impact.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.760]   And there's a huge number of applications outside of visual domain, so speech, automatic
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.560]   speech recognition.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.160]   You're talking about deployment of state-of-the-art ASR algorithms that pay attention to context,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.880]   pauses, is able to do noise removal.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.800]   And on the language side, there's neural machine translation.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.860]   Obviously Google is taking natural language NLP really seriously in both the textual domain
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:06.100]   in speech, that's audio, and again, back to images and video.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:12.140]   This is incredible leveraging to do heterogeneous computing on AI hardware to enable all kinds
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.560]   of cool computational photography features.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.040]   Okay, let's look at some takeaways.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.080]   My two favorite AI chips for Android now are the Google Tensor and the Snapdragon 888.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.200]   Time will tell which wins for which applications, but for now, competition in this space is
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   great for everyone.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.640]   If you want me to talk about other AI systems or about running machine learning code on
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.560]   this and on other phones, let me know.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.200]   I'll close with a quote from Eliezer Yudkowsky.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.880]   "By far, the greatest danger of AI is that people conclude too early that they understand
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   it."
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.480]   Thanks for watching, and hope to see you next time.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:51.980]   Bye.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   [END]
