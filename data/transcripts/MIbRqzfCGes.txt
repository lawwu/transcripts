[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Obviously people can go take a museum hack tour,
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.180]   which is still running as a business,
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.540]   but I'm so fascinated as someone who,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.060]   I don't know if I could tell,
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.260]   if someone asked me the question,
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.700]   how do you do a museum?
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.820]   I don't feel like I would have the answer you would,
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.660]   and I feel like you have a better answer.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.100]   - Yeah, I'll tell your listeners exactly
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.100]   how to visit a museum.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.140]   And there in San Francisco,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.740]   have you been to the Legion of Honor?
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.560]   - I have.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.620]   - Yeah, it's a nice museum, right?
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.660]   That one and the DeYoung are two really nice museums there.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.860]   So here's how to visit.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.660]   Here's exactly from all my time.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180]   And I've been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.700]   more than a thousand times,
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.540]   and I've been to many other museums.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.240]   Here is how you should go about experiencing a museum
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.080]   for the first time.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.740]   So you're going to a new museum.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.700]   - Any museum or is it specific categories
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.660]   work better than others for this?
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.660]   - This applies to any museum.
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.020]   Museum hack, in my opinion, works best for art museums.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.260]   But the thing, the hack, the special sauce
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.180]   I'm about to tell you,
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.500]   the way to approach works for any museum.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.980]   And here's what you're going to do.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.380]   As soon as you get there,
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.700]   you're going to go in right where you buy your ticket,
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.940]   you'll get a map,
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.540]   and you are going to walk the entire floor plan,
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.040]   and you're not going to stop.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.060]   You're not going to stop and look at,
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.180]   I don't care if you love it, you're not going to stop.
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600]   You can circle it on the map and you'll come back later,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.380]   but you're not going to stop.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380]   You're going to walk the entire floor plan
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.280]   to build a mental map of the space
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.360]   and to know where you want to go back to later.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.600]   So first, you'll walk the entire floor plan.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.280]   It could take you between five and 45 minutes,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.260]   depending on how big it is.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.640]   You will then go to the museum cafe.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.180]   Almost all museums have a cafe.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.240]   If they don't have a cafe, you can just sit down
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.040]   and you're going to take a little break.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.900]   I like to go there and I like to get a cup of coffee.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.980]   You can get a glass of wine if you want,
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.960]   and you get a little snack.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.540]   You're going to replenish your glycogen
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.880]   or your glucose or whatever.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.860]   You're just going to have some carbs maybe, some sugar,
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.120]   to build up your energy store, to go back.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.020]   Now that you've seen everything briefly,
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.380]   you will now go back and look closer
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620]   at the things that captured your mind and interest.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.060]   What happens to many people while we do this is,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.900]   have you ever done this?
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.520]   You go to a new museum and you spend like the first hour
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.940]   looking at the stuff that you happen to just walk,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.040]   like you waste all of your cognitive load
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.480]   and looking energy on things
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.680]   that you don't even want to look at.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.320]   Because the best stuff sometimes is at the very end.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.240]   The stuff that you're most excited about.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.520]   And by the time you get to that stuff,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.040]   you're tired and you're exhausted.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.000]   So the way to do it is to walk through
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   the entire floor plan.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.400]   Do not stop at anything.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.720]   Circle things on the map.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.460]   Go to the cafe, take a break,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.420]   and then go back and look closer and deeper
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.780]   at the things you're curious about.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.340]   - And how long does that usually take?
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.180]   Would you say for,
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.140]   I know there are museums of different sizes,
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.980]   but how long would you tell someone to budget
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.300]   for a trip to a museum?
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.580]   - I personally can't spend more than two hours.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880]   I think that this was one of the biggest things
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.800]   that I changed a lot of my friends thinking about,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   is that you don't have to go try to get
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.060]   every single dollar's worth
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.260]   and stay there as long as possible.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.100]   I can spend about two hours at a museum
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.420]   before I get tired.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.960]   This is a real thing, getting tired at a museum.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.520]   It's called gallery fatigue.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.040]   It happens because we're not in an activated space.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.080]   We're quiet, we're thinking.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.520]   We don't know how we're supposed to act.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.400]   It can be stressful sometimes.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   So I spend about two hours total.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.200]   - So about half that time is a run through and a cafe.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.240]   And then the other half is actually kind of
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.400]   spending time in the things you're interested in.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.240]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.120]   Sometimes if I go to a museum for two hours,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.840]   I'll spend an hour in the cafe
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.320]   because I just wanna go approach it with a strategy.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.980]   And many times we don't have a strategy
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.400]   when we go into a new physical space like a museum.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.960]   We're just walking where our body takes us
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.280]   and we're looking.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.200]   And before we know it, we've wasted an hour and we're tired
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.960]   and we didn't even get to go see the really cool stuff
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.360]   that's on the second floor back in the modern wing.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.960]   - And could you do that from the map at home
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.500]   or do you need to be there?
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.140]   - I think you need to be there because you need to walk it.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.560]   You need to physically get in your body
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.800]   and see the stuff firsthand.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.220]   And also there's not gonna be,
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.680]   the museum's not gonna feature like all,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   like you may be interested, like for example,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.840]   I love at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.640]   there's this sofa.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.160]   It's like a green, beautiful green sofa.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.680]   It's not gonna be on any of the museum website
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.700]   or featured top galleries.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.840]   I don't know why I like it,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.480]   but it was owned by the King of Spain or something.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.720]   And I love that thing, and you're not gonna find that
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.520]   when you do the museum's website tour of the galleries.
