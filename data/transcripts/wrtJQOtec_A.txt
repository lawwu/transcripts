[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   Well, I'd like to thank you for that very kind and warm welcome and to express again
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.560]   my sense of real privilege at being here. I find it a most encouraging day. I would
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.800]   like to say this, and especially perhaps for those who are not present and who are listening,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   that while I was in Westminster Chapel for 30 years, it was my privilege during that
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.840]   long period to receive many visitors from your country who would come to see me at the
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.280]   close of a service. I particularly treasure those men who were in the forces, your forces,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.600]   during the war, the last war, both in the Army and the Navy. I look back with very great
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.440]   joy at the many who then came in to see me, many testified to having received blessing.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.680]   And on my various visits to this country, there has been nothing that has so gladdened
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.880]   my heart as to see such men coming on to greet me again, some of them now bringing with them
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.520]   their wives and their children whom they hadn't got when they were in the war. And I've seen
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.200]   their eyes filled with tears as they were telling their wives that this was the man
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.080]   to whom they used to listen during those dark days of the war. So it's a very great joy
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.280]   indeed to be with you once more. But I'm particularly glad to be here in this church, and for this
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.360]   reason, we're all of us who are truly Christian at this time engaged in a very great and a
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.880]   very grievous battle. We're in it in Great Britain as you are in this country. We are
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.440]   fighting for the faith, fighting for the life of the true church. And sometimes, some of
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.400]   us, particularly in Britain, where perhaps we haven't got as many evangelical people
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.760]   as you are privileged to have in this country, we tend to feel a little bit discouraged.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.320]   We tend to feel that we're a small company of people. So I cannot tell you what a joy
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.080]   it is to be here today and to see this great church and this great concourse of people.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.200]   It's gladdened my heart and it's truly encouraged me. So I thank God for this landmark Baptist
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:41.920]   temple and its famous and zealous and valiant fighter for the faith, the minister Dr. John
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.240]   Rawlings. Well, now, I'm sure that you'll allow me just to leave what I feel in my heart
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.360]   this evening on just that note in order that I may continue really what I've just been
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.160]   saying by calling your attention to some words that were written by the great apostle Paul
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.560]   in his epistle to the Romans. And in the first chapter, let me read a few verses beginning
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.280]   at verse 11. He says, "For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.760]   gift to the end that ye may be established. That is, that I may be comforted together
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.920]   with you by the mutual faith, both of you and me. Now, I would not have you ignorant,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.000]   brethren, that oftentimes I purpose to come unto you, but was led hitherto that I might
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.680]   have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. I am debtor both to the Greeks
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.960]   and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise. So as much as in me is, I am
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.640]   ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.920]   to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:26.800]   from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.' But I want in particular
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.520]   to call your attention now to that 14th verse. I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:48.200]   barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise. I call attention to that because it is one
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.920]   of the many definitions that we find scattered about in the various writings of this great
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:03.560]   apostle of what it means to be a Christian. That's why I'm calling attention to it. And
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.120]   I do so for the reason that I've just been giving. We are living in these days of terrible
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.520]   confusion. I suppose there's nothing that is more characteristic of our world tonight
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.040]   than just this very element of confusion. Doesn't matter what realm you look at, you
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.160]   see nothing but confusion. Even in the realm of politics there is confusion. The old labels,
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.760]   the old names seem to count for very little. Everything has become mixed up. And it's true
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.720]   in the realm of thinking, what people call philosophy. There was a time, I'm old enough
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.000]   to remember it, when people used to say that the material came up to one level and the
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.780]   spiritual started at another. But now they're talking about the spirit even in substances
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.440]   like iron. Everything is said to be spirit. There is this confusion. But when we come
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.640]   to the realm of morals and of behavior and of conduct, well this confusion of which I'm
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.920]   speaking is surely tragically evident and obvious. Today the problem is not what is
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.320]   moral or immoral. There are people who don't even recognize morality at all. The whole
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:27.840]   notion of morality is being questioned and queried. And things that 40 years ago every
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.720]   decent person would agree about as being wrong and reprehensible has almost become the thing
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:45.120]   to do by today. This terrible confusion. But the most serious confusion of all is the confusion
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.680]   in the so-called Christian church. And it is a confusion not about secondary or third
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.520]   rate or unimportant matters. The confusion here is with regard to the very meaning of
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.800]   the term Christian. Now it's not surprising that masses of people are outside the church
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.440]   when they hear these contradictory voices coming to them over the radio and the television
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.360]   and what they read in the newspapers. All of them claiming to be Christian and yet diametrically
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.600]   contradicting one another. It's not surprising that the church is as she is. It's not surprising
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.360]   that the world is as it is this evening. And my dear friends, I therefore make no apology
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:40.000]   at all for calling your attention to this primary fundamental question. What is a Christian?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.920]   We can't make any assumptions today. Now there's all this talk about uniting the churches,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.600]   ecumenical movement, world church and so on. But surely before we begin to discuss matters
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.560]   like that, we should be clear about this question. What is a Christian? What does it mean to
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   be a Christian? Well, I needn't worry you and I haven't got the time in any case to
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.920]   give you the various foolish and wrong and false notions that are current with respect
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.560]   to this. There are people calling themselves Christian who belong to the so-called death
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:24.920]   of God movement, don't even believe in God, have no basis whatsoever. Others think that
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.400]   it's just to be good and to be kind and to be friendly. Others think a Christian is just
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.680]   a man who is against war and against bombs, some kind of pacifist or something of that
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:43.960]   description. These are the ideas that people have as to what it is that makes a man a Christian.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.600]   I say therefore that it is essential that we should be certain in our minds as to what
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   really makes a man a Christian. Now then, here we have the great authority on the subject,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.120]   the Apostle Paul, the greatest preacher, greatest evangelist, greatest teacher that the world
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.920]   as ever, the church has ever known. And this is what he says. But now I can imagine someone
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.440]   saying now wait a minute, I can see what you're going to do. The Apostle Paul in that verse
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.200]   of yours, that 14th verse of the first chapter of Romans is talking about himself. And if
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.080]   you were going to hold up the standard of the Apostle Paul to us as this critic, well
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.200]   of course you'll be able to prove very easily and very simply that there are very few Christians
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.120]   in this congregation or listening on the radio or anywhere in the world tonight. But you
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:44.720]   won't be fair. The Apostle was such a unique man, such an astonishing man. And you mustn't
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.160]   compare us with him. Now wait a minute, lest you think that you can get out of this by
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.840]   arguing like that. Let me show you that the Apostle himself makes it impossible for you
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:01.360]   to do so. He says, I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.640]   to the end that he may be established. Then fearing lest somebody might say in Rome, who
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.240]   is this man who puts himself up on a pedestal and says he's got something to give to others?
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:22.880]   He hastens to add that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith, both
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.480]   of you and of me. Now, no, this is not only true of the Apostle. It's true of all great
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:37.120]   men though he was the Apostle Paul as a Christian is in exactly the same position as every other
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:44.760]   Christian. As he says himself, he is simply a sinner saved by the grace of God. I am what
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.560]   I am by the grace of God. He had nothing to boast of as a Christian is in the same position
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:57.440]   as every other Christian. Very well. What is a Christian? Here's his answer. I am a
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:05.760]   debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wires and to the unwise. What
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.200]   does he mean by this? Let's examine ourselves in the light of this. My dear friend, this
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.400]   is a subject about which no men can afford to be uncertain for a moment. The most important
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.520]   question in the world at this moment, more important than the war in Vietnam even or
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:32.680]   anything else is just this. Am I a Christian? Are you a Christian? Do you know it for certain?
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.880]   Why is this the most important question? Well, for the reason that it not only determines
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:45.960]   your life in this world, it will determine your eternal, your everlasting destiny. It's
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:53.680]   the question of questions. Very well. Here's his answer. He says, I am a debtor. What does
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:00.480]   this mean? Well, you see, it means this doesn't it in the first instance, he's a man who's
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:08.800]   got something to give. He owes people something. So he's got something to give. And the apostle
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.120]   has just been saying that as I've read to you, I long to be with you. He says to see
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.760]   you that I may impart unto you, pass on to you some spiritual gift. So here is the first
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.080]   thing which is true about the Christian. He's a man who's got something in his possession
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:32.200]   that he can give to another. Why do I emphasize this? Well, for this reason, there are so
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.720]   many people today who seem to think that the Christian is a man who's looking for something.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.760]   If you got your idea of the Christian from the religious books and journals, so many
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.920]   of them today, you'd think that a Christian is a man who set out in some great quest and
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:55.160]   search for truth. He's a man who's looking for what they call reality and for truth.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.000]   He's an intelligent man who's reading books and philosophy. He's anxious to discover and
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.120]   to find. And there is this idea today that the Christian is that sort of man. That whereas
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.040]   the majority of people are just content to go on eating and drinking and indulging in
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.600]   sex and never think at all about their souls and about eternity, the Christian is a thoughtful
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:24.000]   and an intelligent man and who's trying to discover the meaning of life. He's looking
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.480]   for some way of escape, some means of salvation, a seeker and a searcher after the truth. But
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.720]   you see, this definition of the apostle condemns that immediately. The apostle isn't saying
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.960]   here that he longs to be in Rome in order that he may join the research team in the
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.040]   great quest for truth and for reality. No, no, says Paul, I'm longing to be with you.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.160]   Not that we may look for truth together, but to tell you about the truth I've already found.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.720]   I've got it. I'm not a seeker. I am a possessor. I have something in my possession. Or in the
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.080]   same way, there are many who seem to think that the Christian is a man who is hoping
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.800]   someday for salvation. Oh, they say, I wouldn't like to say that I am saved. They regard that
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.360]   as an impertinence almost. They say, you have no right to say, who are you to say that you
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.680]   are saved? No, no, they say the Christian is a humble man and what he says is that he's
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.840]   hoping that sometime or another before he arrives in eternity, he will know that he's
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.040]   a Christian and that he will have found salvation. He's hoping for it. But again, you see, the
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:44.680]   apostle makes that definition quite impossible. He doesn't say that he's hoping for salvation,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.760]   that he wants to go to Rome to sit on a bench with them to hope that something will happen
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.680]   in some mystical manner. No, no, he's not a man who's hoping for it. He's a man who's
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   already got it. He says he's not ashamed of it. He knows exactly what he has. I know whom
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.480]   I have believed. Very well then, the Christian is not a man who's seeking for it. He's not
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:13.680]   a man who's hoping for it. He's a man who's actually got it. Now then my friends, let's
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:21.080]   be clear about this. Going to this terrible confusion at the present time, let me suggest
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.000]   to you a very simple test, which every one of you can apply to himself or herself tonight
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.520]   to know for certain whether you're a Christian or not. Here it is. Let's imagine that after
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.760]   you've gone home from this service and those of you who are at home, you're sitting in
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:45.080]   your house and suddenly someone comes knocking loudly at your door. You go to the door and
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:51.160]   there you find a messenger and you say, "What's the matter?" Well, he tells you that he's
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:58.960]   been sent there by a man whom you've known for years. He's a man whom you've perhaps
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:05.400]   been brought up with and you've known him all your life. He's not a Christian. You are
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.200]   a Christian, but he is not. You often met him and when you've met him, you've talked
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.880]   to him about these things. You've seen the kind of life he's been living, wasting his
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:22.240]   money on drink and things of that description, neglecting his soul and his eternal destiny.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.520]   And yet there was always something about him that rather attracted you. He was a nice fellow
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.920]   and you felt sorry for him and you kept contact with him. Well, here's the message. While
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.560]   we were in this service, this poor fellow has been taken desperately ill. He's had a
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:47.880]   sudden heart attack. They've sent for the doctor. The doctor's done his best, but suggested
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.360]   they'd better call in a higher authority. And they've done so. And he says, "Take him
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.600]   to hospital at once." And there they're giving him this expert treatment, this emergency
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.040]   treatment. The man's desperately ill and the doctors are quite agreed that there's very
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.600]   little chance of his living to reach midnight tonight. And the man suddenly awakens to this
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.760]   realization. He can see the anxiety on the face of his wife and his children. He can
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:23.040]   see the expression on the face of the doctors. He suddenly realizes that he's dying. And
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.480]   like the prodigal of old having come to himself, he realizes he's in a desperate position.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.880]   He can't lean on his past life. He knows now that it's all wrong. He comes to see the folly
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.360]   of it all. And yet he doesn't know anything. He can't face the future. He looks to the
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.800]   future. He sees nothing but blackness and darkness and despair. He's got no hope. He
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:52.200]   doesn't know what to do nor where to turn. And suddenly he thinks of you. And he thinks
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.920]   of you, of course, because he's known you as a Christian and a member of the church.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.120]   So in his desperation, he sends for you. And this is the message. Well, what do you do?
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.520]   Well, you've no choice. You've got to go. And you arrive at the house and you walk up
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.240]   the stairs or you enter the bedroom or the hospital. And here you are and you're facing
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.000]   this poor fellow who's probably going to be dead before midnight tonight and who's looking
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.800]   into your face and into your eyes as only a dying man can do a man who's dying and who
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.520]   doesn't know how to die and who's afraid to die. Would you like to know whether you're
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:36.960]   a Christian or not? Here's the test. Have you got something that you can pass on to
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:44.800]   that man that will make all the difference in the world to him? No. Will it help him
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.400]   if you turn to him and say something like this? Oh, well, my friend, at last you've
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.120]   awakened to the importance of the things about which I often spoke to you. At last you can
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:04.000]   see the foolish way in which you lived and have squandered your life and your capacities.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.840]   At last you see the futility of it all. If only you'd lived the good life that I've lived.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.680]   If only you hadn't done the things you've done, you wouldn't be feeling as you are now.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.640]   Does that help the man? Of course it doesn't. That's to cast the man into hell before he's
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.240]   dead even. In other words, the Christian is not merely a good man. He's not merely a moral
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.960]   man. The Christian is a good man. But you see, he's not only that for this reason, that
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.880]   however moral you and I may be, you can't give your morality to another. You can't pass
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.320]   on, you can't use the apostles' word, you can't impart your morality to another. And
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.400]   yet, says Paul, by definition, the Christian is a man who's got something that he can give.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.880]   He's a debtor. So he's not merely a moral man. Or I wonder whether it'll help the poor
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.280]   fellow if you turn to him and say something like this. Well, my dear friend, you're obviously
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.080]   dying and you know it. And you're now looking for salvation, for some hope. You know, I'm
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.040]   also looking. I've been seeking this for years. I've been reading books. I've been listening
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.960]   to the lectures of the great philosophers on the television. I'm a seeker and searcher
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.280]   after truth. I'm also looking after truth with you. Is that going to help the man who'll
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:26.960]   be dead before midnight tonight? No, no. It's to cast him into utter hopelessness and despair.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.280]   I say again, the Christian is not merely a good man. He's not merely a man who's looking
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:38.560]   for truth and for salvation and for help. He's a man who says, "I know I have it. I
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.880]   can give it to you." He's a debtor. He has something in his possession that he can give
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:52.200]   to another. But wait a minute. The apostle adds to that definition. He amplifies it.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:59.400]   You notice how he puts it. He says, "I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.680]   both to the wise and to the unwise." Now, this is a very important addition. What's
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:11.920]   it mean? Well, let me put it like this to you. I've met a few men who could say with
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.240]   honesty that they are debtors to the Greeks. What does that mean? Well, you know what sort
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.280]   of people the Greeks were. They were the great intellectualists of these early centuries.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.400]   They were famous for their philosophy. The great philosophers were Greeks. And it was
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.840]   the Mecca, the place to which all people interested in philosophy went. And they were always arguing
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.520]   about truth and this theory and that theory, exactly as the same sort of people are doing
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.920]   today. Now, I say that I've met a few men who could say quite honestly that they're
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.160]   debtors to Greeks. If you gave them a congregation of philosophers, they'd be perfectly happy.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.240]   They could put up this theory and then the other and compare them and contrast them and
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.040]   criticize them and they could go on talking for hours. Debtors to the Greeks. But if you
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.280]   suddenly confronted them with a congregation of people who had never opened a textbook
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.120]   on philosophy and who knew nothing at all about it, perhaps not even the meaning of
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:14.360]   the word, they'd have nothing to say. And not only would they have nothing to say, they'd
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.480]   feel that you were insulting them by asking them to address such an ignorant crowd of
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.160]   men and women. They're debtors to the Greeks. They've got nothing to give to the barbarians.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:30.400]   What of them? They're not Christians, says Paul. For the Christian is a debtor not only
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:37.120]   to the Greek, but also to the barbarian. Now, this is an important point, isn't it? These
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.400]   men you see who give this great show of learning and the impression that they understand the
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:48.480]   mysteries, they can only talk to one another and they have nothing to give to the average
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:56.000]   men and women. That's not Christianity. But for me to be perfectly fair, I have known
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.200]   a few men who could say that they were debtors to the barbarians. I mean by that, that if
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.880]   you want a man who could play on the surface emotions of an ignorant crowd of people, well,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.760]   they were masters at it. Hitler could do that, you know, and there are many people who are
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.360]   masters at handling a mob psychology and they can play on people's emotions and make them
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.640]   do almost anything they like. Debtors to the barbarians. But if there happened to be a
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.640]   Greek kind of person there who came at the end and asked certain questions, they'd have
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.960]   no answer to give him. Debtors to the Greeks, nothing to give to the barbarians. What of
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.560]   them? Well, again, the apostles suggest that these are not Christians either, or to be
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.000]   charitable if they are Christians, they're very poor Christians. For the Christian, my
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   friends, is not merely a man who's had an experience. He can tell you why he's had it.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.160]   He can give you an explanation of it. You remember how Peter supports what this apostle
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   says? Be ready, he says, to the ordinary Christian. Be ready at all times to give a reason for
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:12.600]   the hope that is in you. This is to me a most important matter. We are fighting not only
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.680]   false Christian teaching, we are fighting the cults at the present time. And the cults,
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.920]   you know, can give people experiences. That's why they succeed. Nobody belonged to a cult
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.240]   if he didn't help them in some shape or form. The cults can give people experiences. They
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.960]   say their lives have changed, they've had some wonderful thrill, some wonderful mystical
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.520]   experience. How do we tell the difference between that and Christianity? This is the
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.760]   answer. That the Christian can give a reason for the hope that is in him. He's not only
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:50.560]   a debtor to the barbarian, he is also a debtor to the Greek. He's not merely a man who's
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   had his life changed. He's a man who knows the truth as it is in Christ Jesus, the truth
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:04.920]   that this great apostle expounds in this great epistle to the Romans. Very well, this is
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.760]   what the apostle is saying. He says, I'm longing to be with you in Rome and I'm ready to preach.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.120]   I don't care who listens, he says. I'm ready to preach to the emperor. I've got a sermon
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   for him, but I'm equally ready to preach to the slaves, to the servants, to the soldiers.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   Give me a man, says Paul, give me a soul. I've got something to give him. I don't care
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.000]   whether he's a Greek or a barbarian. I don't care whether he's wise or unwise. I don't
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.240]   care whether he's wealthy, whether he's poor. I don't care what his psychology is. I don't
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.400]   care what his color is. I don't care what his nationality is. Give me a man and I've
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   got something to give him. Yes, he's got something to give and he can give this something to
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:58.120]   anybody, to everybody. But lastly, he's a man who feels that he's bound to give it.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:07.280]   He's got to give it. You see, Paul chose this word debtor quite deliberately in order to
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.000]   bring out this idea of compulsion. He was very fond of saying this. And when we use
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.280]   this word debtor, we think of a man in a court and certain pressures being put to bear upon
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   him in order to get from him this thing, debtor. Now, Paul puts this in different ways. In
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:34.000]   writing in the first epistle to the Corinthians, he says, you ask me why I preach and why I
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.920]   travel as I do and why I'm so indefatigable. The answer he says is this. Woe is unto me
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:47.760]   if I preach not the gospel. I can't help myself. I must do it. Indeed, he goes further in the
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.760]   second epistle to the Corinthians and he puts it in this amazing phrase, the love of Christ
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:01.880]   constraineth me. What a term. He says, I'm like a man in a vice and it's being tightened
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:08.120]   up. It's becoming tighter and tighter. The pressure of the love of Christ is driving
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   it through me and out of me. I can't help myself. The love of Christ constraineth me.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:22.200]   Now that's the idea that's in this word debtor. And this man feels, the Christian feels, that
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.840]   he's got to give this thing. Why does he feel this? Well, I could keep you at great length
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.040]   in answering the question. I mustn't do so. Let me summarize it for you. The Christian
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   feels this of course, because of what this gospel has done for him. It's made him a happy
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:48.640]   man you see. And when a man is made a happy man and given some of the joy of the Lord,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.160]   he feels that he wants everybody to rejoice with him. You know the type of man who's always
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   sitting in the corner on his own. What's the matter with him? Well, he's a miserable man.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.640]   He's got a problem. He's got a difficulty. And he spends his time talking to himself
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.880]   and arguing with himself. But the moment a man becomes full of joy, well, it's a kind
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:16.720]   of radiator. It's this word power. It's like a radiator. The man who's happy wants everybody
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.040]   to be happy with him. He's unhappy in a sense if everybody else isn't happy. There is something
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   radiating dynamic about this great joy which the gospel gives. And the apostle had received
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.200]   this. And every true Christian has received the same thing. And he wants everybody to
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.560]   share it with him. Now I want to put this to you in the form of an illustration. There's
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   nothing original about it. Take this 16th verse. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Now I'm going
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:02.560]   to tell you about that word power. In the early part of this very century in which we
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:09.880]   are living, a man burrowing in some ancient scrap heaps in Egypt found a little bit of
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.840]   parchment, what they call a papyrus, a document. And he made this interesting discovery. I'm
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.980]   only reporting it to you. It isn't my discovery. He discovered this, that the word which is
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   translated power here in our King James Version, that same word was used in the first century
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:40.280]   for our word prescription, what a doctor gives you, prescription. So you can translate Roman
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   116 if you like like this. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the prescription
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:55.960]   of God unto salvation and to health and healing to every one that believeth. So you see what
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.960]   the apostle is saying, I can put like this to you. What's a Christian? When does he feel
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:07.800]   he's got to give this thing which he has to another? Look at it like this. Imagine a man
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   who'd been suffering for years from some very painful and crippling disease, some form of
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.520]   arthritis if you like. There he was, poor fellow. His joints were not only painful but
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.160]   he could scarcely move them at all. Of course he'd gone to his doctor. The doctor had done
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.760]   his best but the man was no better. He'd gone to a higher doctor, still no better. He'd
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.420]   gone to the highest doctor in the country, still no better. And here he was, beginning
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:41.420]   to settle down to a final hopelessness of pain and crippledom. When suddenly he was
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:49.920]   told of some wonderful physician in some other continent. And he was so impressed by what
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:55.360]   he was told that he determined to go and see this great physician. And he went. And at
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.920]   last he finds himself in the room with this great man. And this physician looked at him
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:06.360]   and said, "Yes, I know exactly what's the matter with you. And I can cure you." And
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   he sat down at his desk and he put on his glasses and he pulled out his pen and he wrote
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.960]   a prescription. And he said to this man, "Well now, you go and get that dispensed and you
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.600]   take that medicine. And I can promise you, you'll begin to lose your pain and then your
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.680]   joints will begin to get loose and supple again. And in a short while you'll feel as
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.280]   if you've never been ill in your life." And the man did this. He took the prescription,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   took it to the chemist, the druggist, got his medicine, took it regularly, religiously.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.720]   And as the great physician had prophesied, he lost his pain, he ceased to be a cripple
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.480]   and he was perfectly well. Now this is his experience. He walks up and down the streets
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.920]   of life. And one afternoon he's walking down the street and he suddenly sees a man on the
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   other side of the street. He doesn't know the man, but he recognizes the disease. He
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.880]   can tell by the way that poor fellow's holding himself and the way he's shuffling along that
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:18.920]   he is suffering from his old disease, his old complaint. And he says to himself, "It's
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.760]   obvious that that man has never heard of the prescription that I've got in my pocket. What
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.640]   does he do about it? There's no need to argue. There's no need to have any counseling. There's
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.600]   no need to have any discussion. He says there's only one thing to do. I must cross the road.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.400]   I must speak to that man." And he does so. He goes to him and says, "Excuse me, sir.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.120]   You don't know me and I don't know you, but I do know what's the matter with you. Tell
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   me, have you ever heard of this? The prescription. He's got a certain cure in his pocket and
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:56.840]   the poor man needs it. He's suffering. He doesn't know about the cure. What does he
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.040]   feel?" He says, "I'd be a cab if I didn't tell him. It doesn't matter that I've not
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.480]   been introduced to him. It doesn't matter that I don't know him. I know his disease.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   I can sympathize and I know of an absolutely certain cure." So he gives it him. And that's
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   the Christian. That's this man who's a debtor. He's got this something to give. He can give
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:26.440]   it to anybody. He feels he must give it. Why? Well, because it's the only cure. Because
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:33.320]   it is a certain cure. It's because of what Jesus Christ has done to him and for him.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:39.480]   What has he done? He's given him forgiveness of sins. Pardon. Blotted them out as a thick
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:45.840]   cloud. He's reconciled him to God. He's made him a son of God. He's given him this
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:52.840]   airship of eternity. He's given him new life and vigor and power. Conquest of all temptations,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   which invariably got him down. He's made a new man of him. A healthy man. A whole man.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:05.840]   A man who has salvation. And he opens up before him the glory of everlasting and eternal bliss.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.280]   That's why he feels he's got to give it. Let us pray.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Oh Lord, our God, we thank thee for so great a salvation. We feel that all our expressions
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:26.120]   are inadequate. We feel like saying with Charles Wesley of old, "Oh, for a thousand tongues
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:33.520]   to sing my great Redeemer's praise. The triumphs of my God and King. The wonders and the glory
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   of his grace. Oh God, tune our hearts to sing thy praise aright. Open all our eyes more
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:52.160]   and more by thy blessed spirit. That we may see this salvation as it is in all its wonder
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:35:01.000]   and greatness and glory. And be lost in a sense of wonder, love, and praise. Amen.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.560]   and praise. Amen.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.620]   you
