[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Hello and welcome back and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John with longtime author and
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.840]   pastor John Piper.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.120]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.640]   We get loads of hard questions that require us to think carefully, like this one.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.240]   Is God independent from his creation or is God dependent on his creation?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.720]   Does he need his creation or does he not need his creation?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.240]   The implications here are huge, Pastor John, and the email is from a listener named Chris.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   "Dear Pastor John, I have followed your ministry for many years.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.400]   I have long considered myself a seven-point Calvinist as well, specifically when it comes
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.280]   to the argument that we are in the best of all possible worlds because God is after the
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.400]   greatest amount of glory for himself and greatest good for his people.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.240]   But I see a potential conflict with the independence of God here.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.520]   If it is true that God truly exists independently and without need of anyone or anything, does
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.420]   this conflict with him needing creation in order to display the fullness of his attributes
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.680]   and receive the fullness of his glory?"
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.520]   Another way of asking it is this.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.920]   Could God have been just as glorified without creation?
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.180]   If so, then does the doctrine of best of all possible worlds lose meaning?
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.740]   And if he could not have done it in another way because of his commitment to his glory,
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.840]   then wasn't he in a sense forced all along to act out of a dependency on creation?
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.660]   Let's take three of Chris's phrases and analyze them and then move toward a general answer
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660]   to his concern.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.380]   And I'm not picking on Chris here.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.940]   Virtually everybody who asks this kind of question I think runs into these kinds of
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.000]   difficulties.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.280]   So let's start with the phrase "glorified without creation."
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.800]   He asks this.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.080]   Could God have been just as glorified without creation?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   Now the passive verb "glorified" implies that there's a glorifier.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.300]   And if we supplied this glorifier, the question answers itself.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.760]   So if we ask, here's what it would sound like.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.840]   Could God have been just as glorified by creation without creation?
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.000]   No.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.580]   If there's no creation, then creation can't glorify God.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.860]   And since creation is everything that is not God, the only thing outside God that could
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.320]   glorify God is God's creation.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.860]   So there aren't any other viable options for God being glorified by anything outside God
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.560]   except creation.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.140]   Which brings us to the real question, namely, does God's intra-Trinitarian glory—before
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.380]   there's any creation at all, just Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the eternal joy of
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.500]   the Trinity, the beauty of that fellowship, the holiness of that fellowship—does God's
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.580]   intra-Trinitarian glory need to be glorified by creation?
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.020]   So Chris asks this.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:31.380]   If God truly exists independently and without need of anyone or anything, does this conflict
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.660]   with Him needing creation in order to display the fullness of His attributes and receive
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.820]   the fullness of His glory?
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.820]   Now that's a tricky question, because the word "need" changes meaning in mid-sentence.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.980]   The first use of the word "need" is that God is fully God, complete, without any defect
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.020]   in Himself at all.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.940]   And he says, Chris says, "If God truly exists independently and without need of anyone or
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.180]   anything," and the answer is yes, yes He does, that's right, "He is independent
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.700]   from all that is not God, and as such He has no need of anything outside God to make Him
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.100]   any more God, any more perfect, any more complete than He is."
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.940]   So far, so good.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.940]   No need at all for anything like that to make Him more God, more complete, more perfect.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.940]   But then the sentence continues.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:48.580]   Does this conflict with Him needing creation in order to display the fullness of His attributes
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.300]   and receive the fullness of His glory?
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.980]   Well now, Chris has made the word "need" here refer to God's display of His fullness
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.500]   and receiving glorification from outside of God.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.940]   That was not the issue in the first half of the sentence.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.540]   It's one thing to ask, "Does God need anything from outside God to be the independent, full,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.500]   perfect, complete, all-beautiful, all-glorious, all-worthy God that He is?"
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.060]   And the answer is no, He doesn't.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:32.300]   It's another thing to ask, "Does God need a recipient of His glory outside of Himself
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.580]   in order to receive glorification from outside Himself?"
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.780]   Well of course He does.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.780]   The answer is really contained in the way the question is posed.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   So I'm going to come back to this, the word "need" might not be the right word there,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.300]   because it has connotations that would be all wrong.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.780]   But let's cut to the chase.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.380]   His concern began with my claim, and He agrees with my claim, that this is the best of all
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.860]   possible worlds, from creation to consummation, all things considered.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.060]   This is the best world for God to accomplish all He aims to accomplish, namely the revelation
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.940]   of the full range of His glory in the sum total of all His attributes, climaxing in
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:25.740]   His grace, supremely revealed in the redeeming work of Christ on the cross, with all its
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.880]   undeserved benefits for His people, and best of all, their enjoyment of Him in His glorious
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.300]   presence forever and ever.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:41.500]   It is the best world for the accomplishing of that, and that was His ultimate purpose.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:49.440]   And the implied question from Chris is, if this world is best, and God must surely do
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:59.240]   what is best, then is God, to use Chris's words, "forced all along to act out of a dependency
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.900]   on creation."
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.680]   That is, since this world accomplishes all that God aims for it to accomplish in revealing
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.040]   the fullness of His wisdom and the holiness of His nature and His righteousness and wrath
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.940]   and goodness and mercy and love for the enjoyment of His people, then is He forced to create
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:30.800]   this world and thus be dependent on it, and thus be less perfect in Himself.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:40.840]   Now here are three reasons why I think we are sent on a wild goose chase by the word
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.360]   "forced."
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:54.040]   Three reasons why that word cannot properly describe God's action in creation and redemption.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.560]   Let me read again what he said.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.880]   He said, "Is God then forced all along to act out of a dependency on creation, since
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.520]   He has to do what's best, this best of all possible worlds, therefore He has to create,
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.680]   therefore He's forced, and therefore He's imperfect?"
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.560]   So I think that's a wild goose chase, and to use that kind of language for God is wrong
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.680]   and unhelpful in three ways, or for three reasons.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:26.020]   Number one, for some, the word "forced" would connote that there is a power outside
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.520]   God that coerces Him to act against His internal preferences.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   That's not the case.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.800]   And so that implication of "forced" does not apply to God, and we should get it out
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   of our heads.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.180]   Number two, for others, the word "forced" would connote an internal struggle within
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:51.620]   God with one side of God not wanting to create the world and another side of God wanting
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:58.700]   to create the world, and the creating side wins and forces the other side of God to submit.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.620]   But there's no such warfare in God.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.660]   God is one and acts with all His being consenting.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.780]   And here's the third, and I think this is the most important thing of all, which is
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.860]   why I'm a Christian hedonist and why you and I, Tony, see that Christian hedonism is
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.460]   not icing on the cake of theology.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.900]   It is so close to the center of who God is.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.300]   So here's the third point.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:34.340]   God in fact creates and governs and redeems the world because that is what He loves to
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.780]   do.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:45.460]   He delights to create and guide and save, and He is doing in it what He is doing to
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.780]   bring the people into joy in Himself.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:57.420]   But we do not call doing what you love to do being "forced."
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:04.740]   Nobody uses being forced for doing what you love most to do.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:14.020]   In fact, we call being able to do what you love to do "freedom."
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:22.820]   The meaning of freedom, being able to do whatever you love to do and not regretting it in a
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.660]   million years.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.540]   It's the fullest of all freedoms when the actor of freedom has no regrets.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:39.260]   In a million years, God will be approving of the wisdom and the gladness of his action.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.380]   So, conclusion.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:50.880]   No, God does not need creation in order to be God, and He is not forced to create by
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.820]   any coercive power outside Himself or inside Himself.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:04.020]   Instead, He loves to create and govern and redeem, and doing fully and completely what
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:11.140]   you delight to do, what you love to do, without regret in a million years, is the freest of
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.340]   all freedoms, and therefore God is the freest of all beings.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.340]   Amen.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.180]   This is deep and heady.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.420]   But if you're thinking about these kinds of ultimate questions—questions about why God
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.540]   created everything in the first place, if He was not coerced by any power outside of
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.500]   Himself—there's a great book I have to commend to you.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.260]   It's by Jonathan Edwards.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.300]   We've titled it "God's Passion for His Glory."
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.340]   God's Passion for His Glory.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:43.380]   And you can download the entire book online free of charge right now at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.620]   God's Passion for His Glory.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.460]   Well, on the other side of the weekend, we will talk about fatherhood.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.380]   When young wife and mother is perplexed as to why her husband seems distant from their
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.140]   new daughter, what's going on?
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.500]   What should a husband's disposition be toward his children and caring for them?
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.740]   Good questions up Monday.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.580]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.180]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.680]   [END]
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.680]   1.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.680]   What is the purpose of fatherhood?
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   2.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   What is the purpose of fatherhood?
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   3.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   What is the purpose of fatherhood?
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   4.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   What is the purpose of fatherhood?
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   5.
