[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Let's learn how to get started with WNB using PyTorch in less than a minute.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.040]   I'm Chris Van Pelt, co-founder of Weights & Biases.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.080]   First, install WNB. Now, let's import our Python client, WANDB, and PyTorch.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.680]   Next up, we'll initialize a new Weights & Biases run along with some hyperparameters for this
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.080]   specific experiment. After that, let's set up our PyTorch model and reference WNB.config
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.880]   so that we can reproduce this sweet experiment in the future. We can also pass our model to
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.800]   WNB.watch to automatically log and visualize gradients. Lastly, let's define our training
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.040]   loop and use WNB.log to track our training and validation loss for each epoch. That's it!
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.000]   Seriously! Now you can see the metrics and gradients flowing into your interactive dashboard
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.720]   and your hyperparameters in the runs table. You can also compare different training runs in terms
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:02.880]   of accuracy in the project dashboard. Try out the code yourself by following the link on screen.
