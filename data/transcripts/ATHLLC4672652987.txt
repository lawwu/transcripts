[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.360]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.160]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.400]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.760]   and I think for all of us,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.160]   planning a trip to Disney is something that has
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.040]   or will eventually cross our minds at some point.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.720]   So I wanted to do an entire episode
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.920]   to help you optimize the full Disney experience.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.560]   So today we have Leslie Harvey,
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200]   co-host of the Disney Deciphered podcast,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.680]   to talk about some of the amazing insider tips and hacks
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.880]   that will help you save time, money, and stress
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.880]   planning your next Disney vacation.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.440]   I am so excited, 'cause we're gonna cover how to plan,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.280]   where to stay, what to see,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280]   optimizing your day at the park, and so much more.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.200]   This is gonna be a goldmine of content
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.040]   for anyone going to Disney,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.500]   so let's get into it right after this.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.800]   Give yourself the gift of insane savings this holiday season
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.640]   with Mint Mobile's best wireless deal of the year.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.400]   Right now, when you switch to Mint Mobile
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400]   and buy any three-month plan,
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.280]   you get another three months for free.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880]   That's six months of premium wireless service
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.480]   for half the cost.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.280]   For us and the line we're getting for our new au pair,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.220]   we'll be saving hundreds of dollars over six months
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.240]   with Mint Mobile,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.200]   compared to what we would have been stuck paying
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.820]   if we had stayed on our old Verizon plan,
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.560]   which is why I'm so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.320]   All Mint Mobile plans come with unlimited talk,
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.720]   text, and high-speed data
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.680]   delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840]   Best of all, Mint Mobile lets you order
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.160]   and activate new lines from home
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.920]   on your existing phone using eSIMS,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.860]   and because they're online only,
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.280]   they eliminate the traditional cost of retail
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.740]   and can pass that savings on to you.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.700]   Seriously, I can't think of a better gift
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.800]   than turning an overpriced wireless bill
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.960]   into just $15 a month with Mint Mobile.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.520]   Switch to Mint Mobile and get premium wireless service
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.480]   starting at just 15 bucks a month,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.840]   and for a limited time,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000]   buy any three-month Mint Mobile plan
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and get three more months free
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.360]   by going to allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.480]   That's allthehacks.com/M-I-N-T-Mobile.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.880]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.280]   at allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.240]   - Leslie, thank you for being here.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.800]   - Thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.600]   - We have so much to cover about Disney.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.360]   I'm so excited for this episode,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.760]   but you have an entire brand
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.780]   dedicated to Disney of a podcast.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.320]   Why do you love Disney so much?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.560]   What is it that makes it so magical in your opinion?
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.400]   - Gosh, I mean, I grew up with the films
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.080]   and like so many kids,
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.840]   but I actually really like the challenge of going to Disney.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.240]   I mean, I travel all around the world,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.960]   but I like being able to ride rides
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.880]   and then finding ways to do it smarter and faster
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.400]   and better than everybody else.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.920]   So for me, it's a little bit of a game.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.560]   Of course, I mean, I have to love what I'm doing
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.120]   underneath that, but I like the game
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.920]   of doing Disney a little bit.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.640]   - I think you probably just sold everyone
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   on continuing to listen,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.440]   because I think what you love
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.080]   is what everyone wants to learn.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.440]   And you said around the world.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.800]   So quick recap, there's two parks in the US
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   and how many around the world?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.000]   - Four other parks or four other resorts,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.440]   because there are more parks than that.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.920]   You've got Shanghai, you've got Tokyo, Hong Kong,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.800]   and then Paris, and then you have a resort,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.240]   not a park in Hawaii called Aulani.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.840]   - Oh, interesting. Okay.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.200]   And what do you think is so different
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.800]   about all of these parks and resorts
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.160]   that would help someone think about
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.840]   kind of high level how to pick one?
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.680]   - It's hard.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   I mean, nobody's sort of picking
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.040]   the international parks purposefully.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.120]   Like people, I think at least Americans,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.680]   you know, will go to a Disney park
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.600]   if they happen to want to take a trip to Japan, say.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.400]   I mean, unless you're, I guess, a super fan
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.600]   trying to complete the around the world Disney,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.800]   which, you know, is a different breed of folks,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   myself included.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.440]   But I mean, in terms of the U.S. parks,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.360]   Disney World and Disneyland, those are very different.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.960]   A lot of people will say Disneyland is like a small city,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.480]   and Disney World is like a small state or country,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.160]   maybe even.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.280]   So size and scale, that's the biggest difference.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.240]   People go to Disneyland for one to three days.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.120]   People go to Disney World for five to 14 days.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.480]   So very different kinds of vacations.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.800]   - What is that scale?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.840]   If we double click for a moment, right?
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.760]   I've been to Disney World in the times that I can remember,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   which is maybe one as a child.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.240]   I want to say it was a day or two.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.800]   And then I hear you say 14 days,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.080]   and I'm like, I must've missed a lot of stuff.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.440]   What makes it so much more than Disneyland?
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.960]   - So Disney World has got four theme parks,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   two water parks, two dozen plus hotels,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.600]   all sorts of other shopping districts
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   and things sort of surrounding the park.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.160]   So, I mean, there's just so much to do
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.320]   in terms of square footage, acreage.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   I mean, it's bigger than a lot of cities
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.640]   that you and I will visit.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   And then within those cities,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.840]   there's something in every square foot, right?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   So there's a ride, there's a restaurant.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160]   So there's just no way.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.880]   I've been going to Disney World since I was a kid.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.200]   I grew up in Alabama.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.360]   So that was the park that we drove to.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.520]   And I still probably haven't eaten
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.720]   in half of the restaurants.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   And I go there all the time.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.200]   There's so much to do there.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   - Just out of curiosity,
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.800]   how many Disney park trips do you have
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.920]   under your belt at this point?
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   - I can't count them.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.440]   I could count Disney World
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.960]   because now that I live in California,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.800]   it's a longer trip.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.120]   So I may be only going once or twice a year.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.400]   But I mean, dozens of Disney World trips,
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.640]   dozens and dozens.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.360]   Disneyland, I've lost count
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.960]   because I will often fly down to Southern California
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.360]   and go to Disneyland for just a day, like a day trip.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.400]   I'll take the 6 a.m. flight and be back on the 8 p.m.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.800]   - So if someone's gonna plan one Disney trip
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.480]   for their family this year,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.120]   and they live, let's say in Denver
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.800]   and kind of equidistant-ish, how would you pick?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.000]   Is it more about how much time you have or?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.600]   - Yeah, it's more about the time that you have.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.280]   And I mean, I guess if there's other things
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.400]   that you're interested in doing,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.520]   a lot of people will do a Southern California vacation
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.280]   and then tack on a day or two at Disneyland.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.360]   I mean, that's totally doable.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.000]   If you wanna see California,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.360]   I don't think as many people wanna see Central Florida,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.320]   like as a destination.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   Even though, of course,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.920]   I mean, there are other theme parks to go to there,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.800]   but there's not, I mean,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.600]   and there's the Space Center and things like that.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.960]   But people are more, you know,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.760]   will often go to Disney World,
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.280]   not leave Disney World until they go back to the airport.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   So it's less of a destination, you know,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.880]   other than just Disney.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   So I would say time.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.280]   If you only have a couple of days, go to land.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.760]   I would also say if you have younger kids,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.120]   Disneyland is easier because that scale is smaller.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.760]   So if you've got toddlers, something like that,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.600]   go to Disneyland.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.280]   Disney World's gonna be overwhelming.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.800]   The transportation, you know,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.280]   needing to get back for a nap in the hotel room,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.440]   that's gonna be a lot more
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.600]   than I think a lot of families wanna manage.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.720]   But if it's, you are only going to one Disney destination
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.800]   over the course of your life, I think it's world.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.560]   I mean, that's the bigger destination.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.120]   Even as much as I love Disneyland
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.200]   and that's my happiest place of all of them,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.280]   I think it's gotta be world, unfortunately.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.120]   Hate to admit it.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.840]   - So I think if we're gonna go through this process,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.040]   I'm just gonna pretend like
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.000]   we're maybe planning a trip per se, you know,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.080]   like how do we think about the pre-planning stage
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.480]   and go through that.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.360]   How early do you even need to start this?
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.120]   If you wanna plan a great trip,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.400]   you wanna get all the deals
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.280]   and make it as efficient and optimal
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.720]   and low cost as it can be for the experience.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.560]   And we'll get to that.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.320]   I don't know if it could ever can be low cost,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.600]   but when do you start?
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.680]   - So different timelines,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.720]   if we're talking about world versus land.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.440]   So for Florida, you need at least six months.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.560]   I mean, if you can start thinking about it
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.600]   12 months in advance, that's helpful.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.000]   Is it necessary?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.840]   No, I mean, I can plan a trip to Disney World
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.480]   with, you know, maybe two or three months lead time
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.120]   without really worrying about it.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.680]   But for people who are new to it,
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.400]   I'd say six months just to sort of do the research,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.720]   make sure you can find the hotel availability that you want,
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.000]   you know, all of that good stuff.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.480]   So I think it's always,
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.680]   the earlier you can do it, the better.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.600]   I mean, right now we're recording this in late 2023.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.200]   There are plenty of packages already out for 2025.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.520]   So you can plan more than a year in advance
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.200]   if you so desire.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.560]   - And when you say packages,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.920]   whenever I plan a trip anywhere,
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.440]   I'm always thinking more like,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.960]   I'm gonna book a hotel myself.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.040]   I'm gonna go book everything individually.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.720]   Is there an argument when someone's just starting
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.520]   to think of planning that they should be buying
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.200]   an entire package together?
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.120]   - Potentially.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.360]   I mean, Disney is one place,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.040]   pretty much the only place.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.880]   I mean, if you're gonna stay at a Disney Resort Hotel
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.440]   and only do Disney,
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.560]   it's one place I would say use a travel agent.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   And I never say use a travel agent.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.240]   Like I don't use a travel agent for anything myself,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.760]   but I always use a travel agent
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.520]   when I'm booking a Disney World vacation
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.640]   because it's no additional cost.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.160]   Disney's paying them a commission out of the packages.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.240]   So I always use a travel agent
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.320]   unless maybe like I'm doing something,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.760]   hacking something together myself,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.000]   like I can grab some discount tickets and that's possible.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.600]   But if you're planning like a big week-long family vacation,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.640]   I don't think there's any downside to using a travel agent.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.840]   They're gonna have so much more expertise.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.800]   They're gonna tell you, you know what?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.400]   You don't wanna stay in this hotel because this is noisy
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.200]   or they have construction this time of year.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.560]   I have another one that's better for you.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.800]   Something like that, so.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.680]   - And is that a Disney travel agent
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.440]   or is it just any travel agent that specializes in Disney
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.280]   and how do you find them?
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.480]   - So any travel agent that specializes in Disney,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.320]   and there are a lot of them.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.160]   I mean, there are a lot of people
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.040]   who will book you a Disney vacation who you shouldn't use.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.400]   They are not as knowledgeable as you could be
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.520]   if you were to sit down for, you know,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.400]   and read a blog post a day for the next month,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.440]   you would be better than they would be.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.520]   So you just need to find word of mouth, I think,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.480]   through, you know, finding people who are expert.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.440]   I mean, I'll give a shout out to my co-host
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.120]   on my own podcast, Disney Deciphered, Joe Chung.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.320]   He's a travel agent now.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.280]   He didn't start out that way.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.560]   We podcasted for years together and he loved it so much
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.520]   that he found it was a way to hack his own
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.760]   and his friend's vacation.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.000]   And then of course it went from there.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.360]   So find good people through word of mouth
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.240]   and find somebody that has been to Disney.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   And if they got good advice from that person,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.800]   then you can trust that person.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.360]   - Wait, where do I find that one piece
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.920]   of urgent information?
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.240]   Do you ever ask yourself that
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.760]   and then spend a bunch of time digging around for it?
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.000]   If you're in Notion, it's now so easy.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.840]   Just use the new Q&A feature
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.520]   and Notion AI can now give you instant answers
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.560]   to your questions using information from across your wiki,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.200]   projects, docs, and meeting notes in just seconds.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.120]   You can also ask Q&A questions in plain English
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.720]   from anywhere in Notion.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.600]   So you can find exactly what you need
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.720]   without ever leaving the page you're on.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.440]   If you're not familiar, Notion is an amazing product
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.800]   that combines your notes, docs, and projects
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.160]   all together in one beautiful space.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.520]   I love the product so much
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.920]   and I'm so excited about the new features they're building,
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.200]   which further reinforces our decision to use it
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.040]   as the central place we manage all of our life and work.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.800]   It also makes me even more excited
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.880]   to be partnering with them for this episode.

[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.200]   Even if you're responsible with money
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.160]   and always spend less than you make,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.800]   having a grasp of your cashflow has so many benefits,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.560]   from spotting expenses that you definitely need to cut,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.920]   to being able to better forecast your net worth,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.720]   or even just being able to ask yourself
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.360]   whether you're really aligning the way you spend your money
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.040]   with your own priorities.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   This has always been so hard for me
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.880]   until I started using Copilot,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.080]   which is one of my all-time favorite apps,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.680]   and I am so excited to finally be partnering with them
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.600]   after being such a huge fan.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.400]   Copilot makes it seamless and easy to track your spending
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.560]   and ultimately boost your savings.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.400]   I've tried dozens of apps that do this,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.960]   and Copilot is the only one I've kept using.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.720]   You can link accounts at over 10,000 institutions,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.880]   and their automatic expense categorization
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.360]   is the best I've used,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.720]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.160]   to make it even better.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.640]   You can completely design your spending categories
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.840]   and easily set up rules to auto-assign transactions to them
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.720]   in the future.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.160]   Thanks to Copilot, I've never had a better grasp
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.960]   on my spending and cashflow,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.160]   which by the way, also means I can leave less money
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.200]   in our checking account and more somewhere else
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.160]   where it earns a lot more interest.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.280]   So for the best app to track your spending,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.840]   subscription, and investments,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.040]   go to allthehacks.com/copilot to download Copilot
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.800]   and use code HACKS2 during onboarding
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.600]   for a two-month free trial.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.440]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.680]   and the code HACKS2 for a free two-month trial
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.000]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.640]   - And how do you think about when to go, right?
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.360]   Now we're thinking, okay, I gotta plan months in advance,
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.120]   maybe a little bit less in California, it sounds like,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.560]   but are there, when it comes to crowds and weather,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.520]   seasons to avoid or target?
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.040]   - So think about the school calendar first and foremost,
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.160]   when it comes to planning and crowds.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.360]   So when the kids are out of school,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.360]   the parks are gonna be busier, more generally.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.880]   Not always, but that is the case.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.720]   Summer used to be the busy season at Walt Disney World,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.640]   but I think a lot of people
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.700]   just can't take the heat anymore,
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.880]   so it's not quite as crazy as it used to be,
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.360]   but the kids are still out of school,
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.200]   so a lot of people will take their vacations then.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.220]   The worst week is to go between Christmas and New Year's.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.320]   That is historically, at both parks,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.920]   Disneyland and Disney World,
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.000]   everybody's home for the holidays
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.960]   and wants to run over there for a day
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.920]   or something like that.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.520]   That's the only time I wouldn't go.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.720]   If that's the only time you can go, then you should,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   but if you have choices, choose something else, please.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.440]   - How different from a cost and/or crowd standpoint
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.080]   would, I don't know, let's say if you went
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.400]   during the middle of week in October
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.080]   when there's no holiday versus peak time,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.800]   is that 3X the crowd, 3X the cost,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.200]   or is it narrow enough
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.640]   that it's probably not a huge decision factor?
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   - Most of the rest of the year,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.120]   it's narrow enough
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.880]   that it shouldn't be a huge decision factor,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.800]   and sometimes you can't plan for it, right?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.360]   Sometimes you think, oh, I'm gonna go midweek in October,
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.240]   and the crowds are going to be what we call a level seven day
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.280]   which is still pretty high.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.440]   There's a website called Touring Plans that I really like
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   that has a crowd calendar.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.120]   So they will rate the days from one to 10,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.880]   and you would be surprised.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.920]   There are days that you think would be a two,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.000]   and they are an eight.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.240]   So sometimes you can't necessarily plan around that.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.760]   I don't try to micromanage it too much
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.560]   other than avoiding sort of those really, really bad times
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.920]   that are always bad,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.720]   and the rest of the time, just kind of roll with it.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.560]   I've been on Veterans Day weekend at Disneyland,
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   and it's nuts, but-
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.360]   - That's what all the hacks we're gonna get to are for.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.200]   - Right, right.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.520]   - But I'm guessing spring break
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.080]   is probably another crowded time.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.200]   - It is, but, you know,
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   spring breaks are spread out enough nationwide
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   that it scatters the crowds.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.320]   So this year, I think it'll be worse
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.080]   because Easter falls at the very end of March.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.760]   So a lot more people have the break
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.400]   the week before and the week after Easter,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.640]   whereas if Easter falls in mid-April,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.360]   then the breaks get spread out a little bit.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.720]   So this year, I feel like spring break
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.920]   will be more of a crunch, but not necessarily.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.120]   Oftentimes, you know, Southern schools get off in mid-March,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.840]   and then those New England schools,
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.920]   they don't get off until April.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.600]   So that does spread people out.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.880]   - Yeah, I was looking at doing a trip
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.680]   for listeners to Iceland,
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.080]   and we were like, "When is spring break?"
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.280]   And I was so surprised
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.040]   that there's like not a consistent answer anywhere.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.240]   And then when you're planning in advance,
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.960]   what are the major milestones and what do you do first?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.000]   Is it get your hotel first, flights, book park reservations?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.840]   What are the things that kind of
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.440]   really need to happen in advance?
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.880]   - So hotel and flights for me
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.800]   are usually the things that I'm doing together.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.640]   I'm checking flight prices
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.560]   as I'm looking at hotel availability.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.760]   I mean, now that I have older kids that are in school,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.680]   so we're tied to a school schedule.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.720]   So usually the vacation is dictated by the breaks for us.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.480]   So sometimes we don't really have a lot of choices,
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.680]   but I'm doing those together.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.600]   And hotels, I often book early and then switch.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.440]   So I'm always watching availability.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.400]   I'm looking for a better room type to open up,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.080]   or maybe the resort I really wanna stay in is fully booked,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   but I think it'll come open later.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   So hotel reservations to me are not as firm as flights.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.600]   Flights are something I usually,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.720]   yeah, I'll still switch those two
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.000]   'cause I book Southwest a lot.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   They're more fluid than I think a lot of people might realize
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.080]   and if you're looking and you have to go on a certain date
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.400]   and you can't find your hotel that you are dying to stay in,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.280]   the game's not over.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.920]   Like there's chances to find that hotel later, I think,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.400]   and a good travel agent, I think,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.600]   will also help you in that regard as well.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.640]   But yeah, those are the two things.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.280]   You mentioned park reservations.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.320]   At Disney World, at least, those are going away in 2024.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.560]   So people will not have to make park reservations.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.200]   They will have to buy tickets,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.320]   and tickets are date-based at Disney World.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.800]   So that is something that you have to do,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.760]   but you don't have to buy those six, 12 months in advance.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.040]   You can wait a little bit on those
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.360]   and thank goodness park reservations are gonna be gone.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.760]   Not at Disneyland, though, sorry.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.680]   - Okay, as someone who doesn't know as much,
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.520]   what's that mean?
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   I don't actually know what the difference
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.120]   between a park reservation and a ticket is.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.960]   - Good point.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.400]   So tickets at Disney World, let's start there,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.160]   they cost different amounts
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.520]   based upon what day you're going.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.440]   So if you're gonna go Christmas week,
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.560]   they're gonna cost more than if you go
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.320]   on a random midweek date in September.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.440]   So when you're buying a ticket for Disney World,
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.880]   you're buying a date range, essentially.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   You can go any day in that range
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.040]   versus a park reservation,
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.520]   which is you're going to this park on this date.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.160]   That part is going away.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.480]   You still have to buy for the date range of your vacation.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.280]   So say somebody gets sick
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.760]   and you need to spend a day at the hotel,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.000]   and you can switch your vacation a little bit
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.480]   within the range that you were given on the tickets.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.560]   - Okay. And you're talking about days.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.960]   I think I've always done Disney.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.800]   I don't even know.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.160]   I can't remember, to be honest,
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.880]   but I feel like the one or two times we've done,
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.360]   it's been like a one-day experience.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.840]   I imagine now that we have two children,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.800]   walking anywhere, bathroom breaks, naps, food,
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.160]   as an adult, you could probably pretty easily
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.920]   run through things quickly.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.120]   How many days do you think people need minimum maximum
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.400]   for a Disney trip?
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.200]   And I'm guessing it obviously changes world to land.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.400]   - Yes. So I'd say for world, a minimum of four days,
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.040]   if you're going with a family.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.440]   I don't do anything less than that
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.000]   unless I'm going solo just for research purposes
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.640]   for my blog and my podcast.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.960]   For Disneyland, I'd say two days,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.320]   ideally three if it's your first vacation
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.360]   with younger kids especially, but you can do it in two.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.240]   I just did a trip with my family over our fall break
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.720]   that was two park days and two hotel nights to Disneyland.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.360]   And we did most everything, not everything.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.400]   - And you know, you said you go down for day trips.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.280]   If someone's in Southern California
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.400]   and they have only one day free,
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.800]   but they've got their kids, like, can you do it in a day?
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.640]   - Yeah.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.720]   - I mean, it's not going to be the whole thing,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   but is it worth doing
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   if that's the only opportunity you have on your trip?
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.560]   - It is. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.800]   And maybe you just want to do one of the two parks
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.480]   at Disneyland, but you absolutely can do it in a day.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.280]   And I know tons of people just want to get that taste
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.040]   of Disney while they're doing, you know,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.960]   something else in Southern California or,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.160]   or they live there and it's like,
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.880]   we can only budget to go one day a year to Disneyland.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.200]   Do it. Absolutely do it.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.280]   - Okay. Now we haven't talked at all about costs.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.880]   When people think generally about Disney and budgeting,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.280]   what do you think people should think about in that regard?
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.720]   When I first thought about Disney, I was like, oh,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.200]   you know, I've always gone. It's just been me.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.480]   We've already been there.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.160]   And then now that I think about it as a family,
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.000]   it almost feels like a ski trip and that like,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.600]   it is not going to be a cheap experience.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.440]   Is there any kind of ballpark guidance you think people
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.840]   should use to budget for their Disney trip?
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.040]   - Sure. So, I mean,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.720]   people do have this impression that it's insanely expensive
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.960]   and it can be.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.500]   I ski and I don't think it's as much as a ski trip.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.180]   Not that level of stratospherically expensive yet,
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.620]   especially if you know what you're doing.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.640]   The key is to know what is worth paying for and what isn't,
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.080]   because there are a lot of little additional add-ons
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.720]   that you might need or you might not,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.560]   or maybe you only need some combination of them
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.800]   on certain days.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.640]   So I think that helps to think about.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.800]   For me, for a family of four,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.040]   I like to think about a Disney World vacation.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.720]   It's going to be more than a thousand dollars a night
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   for a family of four when you consider the cheapest hotel
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.040]   and park tickets and basic food and souvenirs.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   So I did a quick little price out just to see what things
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.140]   were looking like.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.700]   And I did a four day, four night vacation
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.040]   for a family of four with just the basics.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.880]   And you're looking at about 4,000 to $5,000
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.080]   like for just the bare bones level.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.240]   Cheapest hotels.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.880]   - Including flights or no flights?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.360]   - No flights, no flights.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.200]   - Okay.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.640]   And obviously there's another end to that.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.360]   It could cost a lot more for the nicest hotels
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.480]   and all the things.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.520]   - Yes, for sure.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.840]   I would say that you can do Disneyland
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.600]   a little more cheaply these days.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.880]   I mean, the cheapest one day,
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.680]   one park ticket at Disneyland is $104.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.480]   And then they have right now a 50% off kids deal.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.440]   So you could take kids.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.640]   - Is that a normal thing?
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.600]   I almost never hear Disney's on sale.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.040]   - No, it's going to be just for January
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.520]   through March of 2024.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.000]   So PS, it's a slower season.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.460]   So if you can go during that time period,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.280]   your kids are like 50 bucks, you're a hundred bucks.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.240]   You get a cheap hotel across the street
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.960]   that's not a Disney hotel.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.680]   You can do that on the cheap, but not all the time.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.520]   - Okay.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   And we'll get into some of the in-park optimizations,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.400]   food and tickets and that kind of stuff.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.700]   We talk a lot about points and miles.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.040]   Is that even a factor for Disney?
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.000]   - It is more for land than it is for world
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   because at Disneyland, we haven't mentioned yet,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.560]   there are only three on-property hotels at Disneyland.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.460]   Most guests at Disneyland stay at off-property hotels
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.680]   that are within walking distance of the park.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.240]   And there are a lot of chains in there,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.160]   a lot of Marriott's, a lot of Hilton's, Holiday Inn's,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.980]   things like that.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.920]   You can use points and miles for your hotel.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.960]   And I do all the time.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.920]   There's a great Fairfield Inn within walking distance
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.080]   of the Disneyland Resort.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.600]   And I am using my points there
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.640]   because sometimes it's good for those certificates
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.160]   you can get with your Marriott credit cards,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.080]   the category one through five certificates.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.720]   You can sometimes use those there.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.440]   So you can for land, and I do.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.720]   You can't really hack the tickets so much anymore.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.840]   There's not a way to like buy them through portals
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.280]   like there used to be, but for hotels, you can.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.640]   And then at world, a lot of people will stay.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.720]   There are a couple of hotels called the Swan and Dolphin,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.280]   and then the Swan Reserve.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.560]   And those are Marriott properties.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.880]   Those are actually located really close
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.960]   to two of the parks at Disney World,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.680]   Epcot and Hollywood Studios.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.460]   So a lot of people will use points and miles
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.580]   to stay at those properties.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.560]   And they're more in the bigger vicinity.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.080]   But I think if you're serious about doing Disney
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.720]   and still want to get some points values,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   it's probably the Swan and Dolphin.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.040]   - Okay.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.160]   And if someone's thinking about budget, just briefly,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.320]   and money's not the issue,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.200]   are there any things to consider
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.240]   before we get into the nuance of hotels and tours
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.080]   and that kind of stuff?
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.240]   - I mean, sky's the limit.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.280]   (laughs)
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.840]   So, I mean, for me, if you have a bigger budget,
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.200]   I think it's worth paying for more conveniences,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.940]   especially at Walt Disney World.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.400]   So we'll talk about it, but like stay at a nicer hotel.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.520]   It's going to have easier transportation.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.400]   Pay for the ticket add-ons.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.360]   There are going to be ways that you can maximize
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.380]   going from park to park or when you start, things like that,
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.600]   if you're willing to pay for it.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.640]   - All right, and so we're planning this trip.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.480]   We've kind of figured out where we want to go.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.200]   We've booked our flights.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.840]   We'll get into hotels.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.920]   So I guess that's the first thing.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.440]   So let's just jump right in.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.120]   How do you think about where to stay,
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.320]   whether it's at the park, near the park,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.460]   Disney property, not Disney property?
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.280]   - All right, so let's start with Disney World,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.240]   because like I said, there's more than two dozen hotels.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.080]   And I'm thinking about transportation
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.720]   when I'm thinking about hotels.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.440]   So there are four parks.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.360]   There's all these different forms of transportation
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.520]   at Walt Disney World.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.720]   There's the monorail, which I think a lot of people know,
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.040]   'cause that's been around for a very, very long time.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.900]   There's something new called the Skyliner,
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.400]   which is like a gondola system,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.840]   like you would see at a ski resort,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   and that connects different resorts.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.760]   And then you've got buses and boats.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.080]   So you have to think about what park
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.680]   are you going to spend the most time in
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.380]   and what has the most convenient transportation
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.220]   to those parks?
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.880]   I mean, I really like the new Skyliner.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.520]   I used to be a monorail girl
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.840]   and always liked to stay at the fancy old school hotels
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.720]   on the monorail.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.120]   But this new Skyliner,
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.280]   it connects Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.680]   and then several of the hotels.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.040]   And I think that's kind of game-changing
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:30.880]   for a lot of people.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.360]   - Okay, and what about staying off property
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.960]   versus on property?
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.120]   How do you make that decision?
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.400]   - It's different at Disneyland and at Disney World.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.840]   At Disney World, I'm almost always staying on property.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.760]   And the reason is both the convenience
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.040]   and the logistics transportation,
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.400]   but it's also the perks,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.760]   the benefits you get to staying on property.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.520]   You will have a better in-park experience
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.400]   because Disney gives preference to its on-property guests.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.640]   At Disneyland, not as essential to stay on property.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.280]   I'd say 80% of the time I'm staying off property.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.520]   There are some perks at Disneyland,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.840]   but they aren't as essential to making your day seamless.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.880]   - And what are those perks?
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.640]   - The biggest perk is early entry.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.120]   - And for both parks?
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.840]   - So at land, yes.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.560]   Right now there at Disneyland,
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.480]   you get early entry into both parks each day.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.040]   That's gonna change in 2024.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.080]   They're gonna alternate parks.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.400]   So it's gonna be less valuable in 2024.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.960]   And for Walt Disney World,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.200]   you get 30 minutes early entry
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.640]   into any of the four parks each morning.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.680]   So you get a jump on everybody else.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.720]   And that's really important.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.120]   If you know anything about theme park lines,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.560]   being early is going to get you
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.320]   the shortest time spent in line.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.040]   So I think that's super valuable for Disney World.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.000]   And there's some other little things
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.480]   like about when you can book
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.200]   what we call your lightning lanes.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.240]   And we'll talk about that too.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.840]   So yeah, it's a lot.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.680]   It's a lot to think about.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.360]   But I think generally speaking,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.000]   Walt Disney World has an on-property advantage,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.080]   less essential for me at Disneyland,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.600]   especially when you consider the hotels
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.240]   are more expensive at Disneyland.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.440]   - And are there any kind of,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.280]   I can't remember the name of it,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.000]   but I was reading someone's post on a blog about Disney,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.560]   and they were like, "Well, if you wanna stay on property,
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.640]   "don't forget you could stay at this one property
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.400]   "that's still on property and has the perks,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.720]   "but it's usually a lot cheaper
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.880]   "and maybe actually more convenient, but slightly older."
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.920]   Are there specific places to target
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.160]   if you want on property and you wanna get a deal?
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.440]   - That might be this one on Dolphin
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.480]   that they're talking about.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   That's my guess because it's a Marriott.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.320]   It's on Disney property, but it's not a Disney hotel.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.640]   It's this weird hybrid.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.960]   So I think a lot of people choose that.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.560]   There are also some hotels at an area called Disney Springs
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.240]   that are also kind of in this hybrid category
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.640]   that get some of the benefits of the on-property hotels,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.600]   but they're operated by third parties.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.480]   So look into those, but at Disney World,
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.960]   there is every price range of a hotel.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.040]   They have value resorts, they have moderate resorts,
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.560]   they have deluxe resorts.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.240]   So you can stay at a value resort,
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.120]   and sometimes you can find a hotel
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   for $150 to $200 a night.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.000]   Not a lot more expensive
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.200]   than what you'll find at Holiday Inn.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.600]   So for me, is it worth like $20 more to be right there?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.360]   Especially when you consider those off-property hotels
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.720]   might charge you parking or resort fee
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.960]   or some other little nickel and dime
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.800]   that they know how to do.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.160]   - If you're on property,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.800]   do you even need a car for the four days you're there?
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.600]   - No, you don't.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.720]   I never, never have a car at Walt Disney World.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.040]   I use only the transportation,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.560]   and then in a real pinch, I'll take an Uber.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.800]   - Any particular hotels that stand out
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.280]   for whatever reason from all of your stays?
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.760]   - I love the Polynesian.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.640]   If only because I love the theming of the South Pacific,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.400]   and it's just sort of an old school,
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.280]   one of the original hotels at Walt Disney World.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.520]   It's on the monorail loop.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.120]   It has a great location
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.640]   where you're on the monorail loop to go to Magic Kingdom,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.240]   but you're also within walking distance of the monorail
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.280]   that goes to Epcot at a separate station
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.000]   called the Transportation and Ticket Center.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.400]   So I love that hotel.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.840]   I actually really love Caribbean Beach Resort,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.480]   which is a moderate
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.040]   because it's at the hub of the Skyliner station.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.400]   So you can take a quick Skyliner
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.440]   to two different theme parks from Caribbean Beach.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.960]   The price is right.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.400]   You know, it's not super fancy,
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.520]   but it's got a fun pool for kids.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.720]   So that's kind of like my mid-range pick,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.280]   especially for families.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.360]   And I also love at the lower level, the value level,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.320]   Hop Century Resort because it's also on the Skyliner.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.440]   So if you really just want a clean place to stay
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.320]   and some easy transportation, that's an easy way to go.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.400]   - You mentioned for families.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.960]   And I think about traveling.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.240]   If you've got five people and you're kind of in that boat
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.960]   where you can't just have one room,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.480]   is there a particular property
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.040]   where you kind of get a better deal for a suite
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.560]   or something with more space?
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.360]   - A lot of people like the Art of Animation family suites.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.320]   Those can sleep up to six, but they are pricier.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.600]   I mean, they're kind of like the cost
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.960]   of two value resort rooms put together.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.880]   So that's something to think about.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.080]   I mean, a family of five at Disney World
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.840]   can stay in most moderate and deluxe resorts.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.200]   You can't stay in a value,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.720]   but a lot of the moderate resorts,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.560]   like the Caribbean Beach that I just mentioned,
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.880]   they have rooms that sleep five.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.200]   So you could squeeze in there.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.080]   And I still am at the stage where with my family of four,
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.600]   we're staying in a single hotel room.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.680]   So I'd rather stay in a nice hotel room
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.880]   as a family of four than a cheaper one and splitting up.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.960]   - Okay, so we got our hotels booked, we got our flights.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.720]   Now we're talking about parks.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.680]   And how do you think about all of the parks, right?
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   When I first thought about this, I was like,
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.400]   "Oh, you go to Disney."
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.360]   It's like, "Well, no, no, no."
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.440]   There's four parks, how many days?
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.920]   How much are you planning out
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.840]   in advance of what you want to do?
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.960]   - I mean, generally speaking,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.680]   I think you want to spend a day in each park.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   So like I said, you want to take that four-day vacation
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.760]   to Disney World.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.840]   Magic Kingdom is the park that everybody recognizes
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.880]   with the castle, right?
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.040]   And that has the most to do 'cause it's the oldest park.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.080]   I mean, they've added more to it
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.880]   over the course of its 50-year history.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.320]   So that's the park you probably want to spend
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.160]   the most time in.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.640]   But if you have four days, a day in each park, that works.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.280]   That gives you the taste of each, you know,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.240]   different atmosphere and whatnot.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.000]   If you have a longer trip, I think a lot more people
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.200]   will take that second day in Magic Kingdom
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.840]   or they'll mix and match a little bit.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.320]   You know, there's something called the park hopper ticket
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.960]   that you can get that allows you to go to multiple parks
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.280]   in a single day.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.800]   And a lot of people will start their morning
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.260]   at Magic Kingdom, ride all the rides,
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.160]   and then they'll go to Epcot at night
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.200]   because that's got all the great restaurants
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.240]   and the food festivals,
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.640]   and that's where they want to eat dinner.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.720]   So think about those kinds of things.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.500]   I mean, you'll get a sense from very quick research
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.800]   what each park is about.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.760]   I mean, Magic Kingdom is the classics.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.480]   Epcot's got this around the world world showcase,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.320]   and then lots of futuristic things.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.640]   Hollywood Studios has got a lot of thrill rides,
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.840]   and it used to be a studio, a real studio park.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.920]   It isn't anymore.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.640]   And then Animal Kingdom is like a park unto itself.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   It's this outdoor landscape that has full of animals
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.880]   and unique outdoor attractions.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.720]   So each one has a different vibe,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.640]   and you'll quickly figure out which one is your vibe.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.480]   - And then in Disneyland, you just have two options.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.320]   - Two options.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.720]   So you have the Castle Park there,
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.160]   Disneyland Park is what we call it,
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   and then Disney's California Adventure,
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.280]   which I'd say its closest cousin in Florida
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.660]   is Hollywood Studios.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.440]   I think both of those are worthwhile doing.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.120]   There's more to do at Disneyland Park.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.420]   I would usually say for people spending three days
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.800]   at Disneyland, you want to spend two days at Disneyland
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.560]   and one day at California Adventure.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.000]   - And in Disney World, is there a park that,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.320]   if you went for five, and you're like,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.400]   where are you going to spend the fifth day?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.320]   Is it more do the four and go back to the one you loved,
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.740]   or is there one that really kind of needs more time?
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.580]   - Yeah, I mean, do the four
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.560]   and go back to the one you love.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.960]   I think for most people, that's going to be Magic Kingdom,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.120]   just because there's more to do there.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.040]   Especially for families, if you have younger kids,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.880]   there's more to do for them at that park.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.700]   I mean, for adults, maybe it's Hollywood Studios or Epcot,
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.780]   I would say, because you've got the food in Epcot,
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.820]   you've got the thrill rides at Hollywood Studios.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.660]   Animal Kingdom, I would say, is the only one.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.480]   I mean, some people love that park,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.100]   love, love, love that park, but it has less to do,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.900]   and a lot of people treat that as a half-day park.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.660]   - And is it easy to get between these parks?
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.660]   I'm thinking right now, and maybe this is just
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.620]   because we have a one and a three-year-old,
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.380]   I'm like, when we plan a weekend day,
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.820]   one activity is enough, you know, one activity.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.920]   And then I'm thinking like going to two theme parks
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.360]   in one day seems crazy.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.600]   - Yeah, don't park up if you have a one and a three-year-old,
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   that's not necessary.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.100]   But yes, I mean, you've zoned in on the fact
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.040]   that there is significant transportation
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.100]   at Walt Disney World.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.920]   You've heard me talk about buses and ferries
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.600]   and Skyliners and monorails,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.640]   and you will take nearly all of those things
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.440]   if you were there for a week in Florida, and it's a lot.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.160]   So if you're staying at a hotel that's on the monorail loop,
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.480]   and you're getting up,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.800]   and you're taking the monorail into Magic Kingdom,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.940]   and you're headed back at the end of the day,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.420]   the logistics aren't so bad.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.340]   But it's when you start moving around the greater resort
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.740]   over the course of a week that you will have more time
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.720]   on the bus that isn't coming,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.220]   and you're standing at the station, things like that.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.980]   - I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.120]   and even listeners about identity theft and phishing scams
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.460]   causing so much pain and hassle,
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.980]   and it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.300]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.760]   and protect our personal data.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.840]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.480]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.460]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.800]   When I first looked up OurFamily,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.020]   there were hundreds of pieces of our personal info out there,
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.200]   but thankfully, I started using Delete.me
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.840]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.800]   removed from the web,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.760]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.040]   for this episode.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.960]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.480]   and remove your personal information
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.820]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.600]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.460]   and get that removed as well.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.200]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.860]   and on average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.600]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.680]   When I first signed up, I was actually skeptical
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.820]   about needing a service on an ongoing basis,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.720]   but these data brokers are relentless,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.620]   and I've seen my personal data pop up again and again
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.020]   throughout the year, so I love having a service
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.420]   that continuously sends me updated reports
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.220]   on all the removals they're doing in the background.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.420]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.500]   removed from the web, go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.940]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.940]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.940]   With the market always feeling uncertain
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.880]   and interest rates at all-time highs,
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.820]   the only thing I feel I know for certain
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.860]   is the importance of diversification,
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.180]   and one way I diversify my portfolio
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.460]   is with our longtime sponsor, Masterworks,
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.260]   the art investing platform.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.620]   Now, I know art investing is unusual,
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.540]   even though I've talked about it on the show,
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.140]   but one thing I like about it is that data from UBS
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.060]   shows private assets like fine art
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.420]   can be especially valuable when looking for low correlation
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.400]   as they've historically moved independent of stocks.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.260]   So, like I said, I invest with Masterworks myself,
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.020]   and it's been impressive to see their history
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.020]   of performance stretch over multiple years now.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.900]   They've had 16 successful exits to date,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.060]   netting their investors annualized returns of 10, 17,
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.540]   and even 35% this year, just to name a few.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.140]   They've also recently launched pieces
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.340]   from artists like Banksy and Basquiat,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.140]   and now have over 800 million in assets under management.

[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.780]   - We kind of have an idea.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.380]   Let's talk about some of the things you need to do
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.540]   before you get to the park.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.100]   How do you plan the day?
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.000]   What are those add-ons, Genie+, Lightning Lanes,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.820]   that make sense to pre-plan ahead?
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.620]   And how do you start to get into the day?
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:41.240]   - So Genie+ is the thing that everybody
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.340]   should give a fair look to,
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.180]   especially if you have older kids.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.180]   I mean, maybe not as much with a toddler,
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.260]   every park, every day.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.220]   But Genie+ is Disney's replacement to FastPass.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.500]   I think a lot of people know that the word FastPass,
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.780]   Disney got rid of it after the pandemic.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.860]   And it now has something called Genie+.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.180]   And Genie+ gives you access to the Lightning Lane
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.260]   for quite a few rides.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.500]   And that's a lane like you might understand
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.340]   has a shorter weight.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.700]   It doesn't have no weight, but it has a shorter weight.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.380]   But a lot of theme parks,
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.460]   you buy some sort of astronomical add-on, right?
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.900]   The Fast Lane, the FastPass, whatever they call it.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.180]   And you just get to go through the short line
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.380]   whenever you want.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.820]   Not so at Disney.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.460]   At Disney, you actually have to book a return time.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.700]   And this is a very complex system.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.980]   And this is something that's daunting to a lot of people
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.860]   because it's a whole new system to learn.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.940]   But once you learn it,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.900]   if you're somebody who's into that gamesmanship
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.200]   that I talked about, it is so much fun.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.420]   Like figuring out how to hack it,
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.460]   figuring out which ride that you're gonna pick first
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.300]   in the morning, that's going to set you up
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.540]   to pick other rides later in the day.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.380]   It's a lot.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.580]   And I have a whole episode on it on my podcast
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.760]   that folks should go listen to
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.220]   if they wanna learn the basics.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.300]   It's episode 256 of the Disney Deciphered podcast.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.540]   It's Genie+ 101.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.420]   And that'll give you the lay of the land
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.240]   for understanding Genie+.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.900]   But it's an extra add-on.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.420]   It costs about 25, 30 bucks a day,
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.180]   depending upon when you're going per person.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.140]   I think it's worth it,
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.380]   at least for one day of your vacation,
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.500]   whether that's in Florida or in California,
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   because it does allow you to dodge a lot of the lines.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.420]   - And are there specific rides
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.060]   where the lines really matter
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.380]   versus ones where it's not as big of a deal?
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.220]   - For sure.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.260]   I mean, like you think, it's the thrill rides
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.920]   where it's really going to matter.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.660]   It's things like Space Mountain or Seven Dwarfs Mine Train,
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.500]   which is a popular coaster in Magic Kingdom.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.900]   It's Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout,
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.500]   which is the drop right at Disneyland,
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.780]   Disney California Adventure.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.820]   So things like that,
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.060]   that's when you're going to really shortcut the lines,
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.740]   because a lot of those thrill rides,
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.600]   I mean, they could have 60 to 90 minute waits
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.440]   on a low crowd day.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.020]   Forget about what they're going to look like
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.380]   on high crowd day.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.300]   - And are some people just going to Disney
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.800]   and waiting in line for an hour or two hours?
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.020]   I mean, I feel like if you did that,
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.620]   you'd get through like four rides
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.620]   and that would be your day.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.460]   - Yeah.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.720]   I have a friend who went to Disney World last year
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.940]   during the Christmas holidays.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.620]   She didn't call me first.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.260]   She should have called me first.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.780]   And they went during Christmas week.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.460]   They didn't buy the add-ons
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.820]   and they did three rides one day.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.860]   That was it.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.780]   That's a lot of money to spend on park tickets
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.220]   to get three rides.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.780]   - If they had really dialed it in,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.180]   if they had, maybe they didn't stay on property
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.020]   and go in early.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.300]   Maybe they didn't do Genie Plus.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.640]   Maybe they did the wrong order.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.180]   How much different do you think that day
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.320]   for them could have been?
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.820]   - I mean, regular people could have done seven or eight.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.860]   I could have done a dozen, you know,
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.180]   with my level of expertise,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.540]   even with the Christmas crowds.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.580]   So, you know, and then there are days like
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.660]   that I've been in the parks without working too hard,
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.180]   just with my family at Disneyland
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.080]   over this busy fall break period.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.300]   We did 20 rides at Disneyland one day
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.740]   while still doing a sit down lunch
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.280]   and leaving the parks before the fireworks started at night.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.660]   - And what's the like, I mean,
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.340]   obviously people should go listen to this episode
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.740]   on Genie Plus, but is it all just optimizing Genie Plus
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.900]   that allowed you to like?
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:11.100]   - Yeah, it's mostly just knowing what ride to book first,
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.220]   because what will happen is the Lightning Lane return times
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.420]   will sell out for certain rides as the day goes on.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.060]   So, you know, you have to pick,
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.000]   for example, in Hollywood Studios,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.900]   if you don't pick the Slinky Dog Dash coaster
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.680]   as your first pick, it might be gone for the day
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.740]   by the time you're eligible for your second pick.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.180]   So it's knowing the sequence of the rides
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.500]   that you need to pick.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.300]   And then it's knowing what to do if crazy things happen.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.180]   So for example, if a ride breaks down
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.860]   and you've got a Genie Plus return time for it,
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.800]   what happens is Disney's app will give you this thing
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.020]   called a multiple experience pass,
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.860]   and that's good at other rides.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.060]   So it's knowing about where you should use that
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.740]   and then what you should do next,
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.660]   how you should adjust on the fly
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.900]   to these curve balls that happen,
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.500]   because you will plan out a day at Disney
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.020]   and then a ride will go down.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.200]   And then your whole plan,
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.020]   you have to be able to adjust on the fly.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.860]   And that's fun.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.020]   I mean, sometimes it's frustrating
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.060]   'cause sometimes three rides in a park will go down.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.380]   The last time I was at Hollywood Studios
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.540]   that happened in the morning, I had gotten there early
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.420]   and three of the headliners were down
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.300]   within the first hour of park opening.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.460]   So that's annoying, but you just roll with it and you adjust.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.500]   - And do you think the average person could go listen?
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.440]   People that listen to this show love to optimize things.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.140]   They go listen to that episode.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.960]   How close to 20 can they get?
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.100]   Or is this something where they should be hiring
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.900]   a Disney expert to help them plan their day?
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.920]   - If you're interested enough to listen to that episode
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.580]   and do a little research,
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.540]   look at the app before your vacation,
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.620]   you won't do 20 on your first day,
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.520]   but if you're going on a seven day vacation,
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.660]   I bet you can do 20 by your seventh day.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.500]   - That's awesome.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.580]   I'm excited for this challenge.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.420]   - Yeah.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.740]   - But not with a one and a three-year-old.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.660]   I guarantee we cannot do 20 rides.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.740]   - Yeah, probably not.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.860]   - Although I imagine there are some rides
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.600]   where using the Genie+ would be a total waste
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.180]   because the lines aren't as bad.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.020]   Is that fair?
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.960]   - Yeah, and there's some rides.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.860]   So this is, again, one of these big differences
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.300]   between Disneyland and Disney World.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.000]   At Disney World, there's pretty much Genie+ for every ride.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.780]   I mean, there's a couple that there is not,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.740]   but pretty much every ride has Genie+.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.180]   Whereas at Disneyland, only about half the rides,
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.220]   maybe less than that, have Genie+.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.260]   So you're in standby lines for the other rides,
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.580]   whether you like it or not.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.140]   So it's about knowing how to mix and match
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.260]   your standby lines and your Genie+ lines.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.140]   - Okay, and then when it comes to optimizing the day,
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.100]   so tier one is just wing it, don't do any prep,
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.620]   go on three rides like your friend did,
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.900]   at least during the holidays,
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.980]   you could dial it in, listen to the episode, Genie+.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.940]   Are there any other levels of optimization?
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.660]   - I mean, you can just do it casually,
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.820]   especially at Disneyland.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.100]   I mean, this is one of those things that's like,
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.140]   if you don't wanna learn this as much, go to Disneyland,
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.260]   because you could listen to an intro episode
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.060]   and do it for the first couple of selections of the day
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.780]   and have a fantastic day at Disneyland.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.540]   It's gonna be harder at Disney World
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.740]   because the rides run out faster.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.300]   It's a more complex matrix
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.420]   that you're working in at Disney World.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   So I'd say, yeah,
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.340]   if you wanna learn this on a casual level,
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.100]   go to California and it's highly, highly usable.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.860]   - And what about for someone who's like,
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.900]   I'm still going to Disney World,
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.900]   I don't wanna learn this.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.460]   Are there options?
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.420]   You know, I know there's the VIP tours.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.260]   I know there used to be some tour guides
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.020]   you could hire outside and bring in.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.260]   What are your options if you want a little bit more
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.500]   of like a help make this simple
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.060]   without having to do too much work,
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.620]   but still get a great experience?
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.460]   - Sure.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.300]   So, I mean, yes, there are VIP tours.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.660]   They are many, many thousands and thousands of dollars.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.700]   I mean, I haven't looked at the pricing at the moment,
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.580]   but like think about like an eight hour day
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.660]   starting at $5,000 for, you know,
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.140]   a group of like up to eight people,
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.300]   something like that, eight or 10.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.980]   I can't remember the exact parameters off the top of my head,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.740]   but yes, so you can do this.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.700]   And they will take you through the lightning lane
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.340]   of any and every ride that you want.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.260]   And they will bring you bottles of water
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.460]   while you stand in the heat.
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.860]   And it's lovely.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.260]   I have a lot of friends who have done it,
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.300]   but it's not something that even folks
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.900]   who have money to burn can do for a week-long vacation.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.460]   You still would only do that unless you're Kim Kardashian.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.340]   You would only do it for one day of a week-long vacation,
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.180]   no matter what.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.140]   So yes, you can do that.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.460]   And I did have a friend do this last year with her family.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.740]   And I can't remember how many rides they got on,
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.500]   but I think it was about maybe about 15 or 18
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.620]   over three parks at Disney World over the course of a day,
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.020]   like an eight or 10-hour day.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.500]   So pretty solid.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.780]   But yes, so you can do that.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.620]   There are also people,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:40.220]   I mean, your travel agent can give you a nudge, right?
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.940]   They can give you a list, things like that.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.620]   There are itineraries that you can buy from people.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.220]   I mean, there are people who will sell things.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.660]   There's, like I said, I already mentioned touring plans.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.580]   They can give you an optimized list if you subscribe
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:53.700]   and it's very low cost.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.140]   That's a possibility.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.060]   There are some people who will,
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.020]   and this is very like on the edge,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.660]   the gray hat kind of techniques,
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.900]   who you can tell them what you want to do.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.100]   They will book your lightning lanes from home.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.980]   - Yeah, I've heard about this service.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.380]   I've also heard about, I don't know,
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.860]   this is definitely probably crossing the line.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.260]   And we could talk about some of the things
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.180]   that have recently gotten kind of shut down,
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.020]   but somehow someone I know went
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.300]   and had someone at home managing
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.220]   their Disney lightning passes,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.140]   but somehow they had two different Genie Pluses.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.100]   So they could, like they were running two separate systems
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.940]   at the same time.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.700]   Maybe they had two park passes, I don't know,
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.620]   but somehow they were like queuing up
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.500]   in multiple apps at the same time.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.420]   Someone else was managing it from remote
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.260]   and they were able to do twice as much,
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.780]   which might sound crazy to consider buying two park passes
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.900]   and two Genie Pluses, but you know, these VIP tours,
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.260]   I want to say there's something, you know,
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.620]   like you said, like $5,000 for 10 people.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:57.060]   So you're going to spend an extra $500 a person at minimum.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.100]   So it could be less expensive to do that.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.700]   Is that something you've ever come across?
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.580]   - So there are all sorts of IT loopholes
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.740]   and as fast as people discover them,
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.420]   Disney shuts them down.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.100]   Some of them, not all of them.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.260]   So you can't buy, at least as of right now,
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.900]   you can't buy two Genie Pluses.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.460]   So if that was a loophole that was a while ago,
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.620]   it may have been shut down,
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.260]   but there are things that happen.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.140]   There are glitches.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.420]   There are like things that you can take advantage of.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.780]   This is one of those things where, you know,
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.140]   I highly recommend, just like there are with Miles & Points,
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.860]   there are Facebook hacker groups.
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.420]   People will talk about this.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.860]   So if you're interested in getting into that, you know,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.300]   reach out to your Disney experts that you know,
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.300]   and there are some folks who will know what's going on,
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.860]   but there were a lot of loopholes,
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.940]   especially when Genie Plus first came out,
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:45.460]   which was about two years and change ago.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.840]   And Disney quickly patched up about 75% of them,
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.140]   which was, it was fun while it lasted.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.700]   - And, you know, I know one time when we went skiing,
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.940]   it was kind of a similar situation where someone was like,
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.440]   "Oh, I want to do a lesson."
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.640]   But it seems so crazy that the lessons at the resorts
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.700]   were like, you know, a private lesson at a resort
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.740]   could be like a thousand dollars a day or something.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.180]   And you meet the instructor and they're like,
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.100]   "Oh, I made like a hundred bucks today."
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.000]   And so they were like,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.620]   "Maybe I could just find an instructor on Craigslist
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.680]   that could just teach me on the mountain for less."
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.140]   Is there any kind of finding a Disney tour person
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.340]   that could take you around the park
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.300]   and help you figure it all out and optimize it
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.380]   without having to spend $5,000?
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.620]   Does something like that exist?
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:27.660]   - There have been a lot of third-party VIP tour services
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.480]   like that over the years.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.020]   And it's funny that you should mention it right now
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.040]   because just this very week that we're recording this,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.060]   Disney began cracking down on these third-party services
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.520]   because technically they're against the rules.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.020]   I mean, they're doing something commercial
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.600]   on Disney property and that's against the park rules.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.460]   And Disney actually went up to a bunch of them
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.240]   and issued them trespass notices this week.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.060]   So the future of those services is highly in doubt.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.800]   I mean, a lot of them haven't been shut down,
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.680]   but it's a risky approach at the moment,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.500]   not knowing if Disney's gonna keep doing this crackdown
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.180]   or whether they're gonna just sort of let it go.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.380]   But a lot of these guides were abusing certain,
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.860]   not a lot, but some of the guides were abusing things
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.560]   like the Disability Access Service,
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.940]   which Disney rightfully wants to make sure
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.200]   is not being abused.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.120]   So I think that's to be continued,
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.900]   to know what's gonna happen with these services.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.860]   - And are these things like you have to know someone
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.140]   and find a secret website,
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.420]   or were they things that you could search around for
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.620]   and say, you know, Disney tours, and you'd find them?
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.860]   - Oh, this was easy to search for.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.300]   I mean, these folks were openly advertising these
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.580]   and, you know, you'd hear about them
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.740]   in any Disney planning Facebook group.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.300]   People would have recommendations.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.700]   I mean, this was easy to find almost as a travel agent.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.100]   - Oh, okay, all right.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.820]   Those are the kind of options for planning the trip.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.240]   You mentioned there are some other perks
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.740]   that you get with the hotels and the park
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.500]   beyond getting in the park early.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.860]   Are those kind of relevant
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.380]   when it comes to this stage of planning?
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.580]   - Yeah, so I should mention,
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.780]   and when we mentioned Genie+,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.940]   one thing we didn't mention
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.300]   was something called paid lightning lane.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.860]   And there are a couple of rides that aren't on Genie+,
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:58.900]   but they do have lightning lanes,
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.420]   but you have to pay an extra fee for those.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.620]   So it's another upsell that you have to consider.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.820]   And if you're staying on property,
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.300]   you get the right to buy those paid lightning lanes
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.940]   at 7 a.m., and it may not sound like,
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.520]   it sounds like a consolation prize.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.300]   It's like, here, you're paying more money to stay on site,
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.660]   and then you can pay us more money.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.380]   But it gives you the chance to get a ride
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.240]   during a high crowd period
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.840]   that folks who are staying off site
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.300]   might not be able to get a lightning lane for at all.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.260]   So at 7 a.m., you can make the reservation.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.260]   Everybody else who's staying off property,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.660]   they can only make that reservation once the park opens.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.220]   So all of the lightning lanes may be sold out
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.380]   for the day for those folks.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.980]   - Gives me kind of a little anxiety just thinking about,
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.040]   it's like, okay, I'm gonna book the return time
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.880]   to come to this ride.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.980]   I gotta be back in two hours.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.620]   What do I do in those two hours?
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.660]   Oh, I'm gonna go do this ride,
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.020]   and oh, it's taking a little long.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:48.860]   Am I gonna miss it?
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.340]   Like, how do you kind of plan your day
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.100]   when you have specific reservations,
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.260]   but you're all over a park?
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:58.220]   - So the ride reservations at least are an hour-long window.
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.540]   So you have an hour to return to the ride,
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.580]   and practically speaking,
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.720]   you also can scan into the ride five minutes
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.460]   before that hour starts and 15 minutes after.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.940]   If something happens, there are lots of cast members,
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.860]   guest relations, who can adjust these on the fly.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.300]   Like, if you're walking up to a line
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.700]   and you're 20 minutes late for your Lightning Lane window,
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.380]   and a cast member sees that you have
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.260]   an 18-month-old with you, and you're like,
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:24.100]   "We had a bathroom emergency," or something like that,
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.140]   like, they're gonna let you in.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.420]   They're gonna let you use your Lightning Lane.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.180]   I mean, for everything but maybe, like,
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.140]   the newest of attractions that just opened.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.260]   But, like, there's flexibility within this,
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.220]   and the Disney cast members are human,
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.460]   and they know that people are dealing with things like kids
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.500]   and, you know, a mealtime that runs longer than we expected.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.760]   It's a firm guideline, but it's not a hard rule.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.140]   - What are some of the rides
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.100]   that you kind of personally think
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.300]   are maybe underappreciated or overhyped?
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.820]   - Ooh, lots of things are going through my mind.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.540]   I mean, I think a lot of people would say
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.540]   that Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at Walt Disney World,
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.660]   at Magic Kingdom.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.940]   The line is never justified as a standby.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.000]   Like, that line can sometimes get, like, 120 minutes long.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.100]   Don't ever stand in that.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.720]   It's a great, cute little coaster.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.840]   I love it, but I'm not gonna stand
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.920]   into a two-hour line to ride it ever.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   So, you know, definitely look for things
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.820]   that are maybe, like, in the corners of the park.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.220]   Like, with young kids, for example, at Disneyland,
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.100]   I love going on Winnie the Pooh.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.080]   The kids love that ride.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.720]   It's way back in the back corners of Critter Country,
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.900]   so a lot of people don't make their way over there
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.000]   until, you know, midday.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.360]   So if you're going to that ride
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.520]   at, like, 11 o'clock in the morning,
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.720]   you probably won't have a wait.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.040]   So look for things like Gas Flow.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.300]   I think it helps to start sometimes,
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.420]   or at least not immediately,
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.040]   but, like, within the first hour of getting into the park,
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.700]   go where other guests aren't going.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.540]   Go deeper.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.040]   Look for those little sweet spots.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.420]   But I think most of the thrill rides,
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.840]   the standby lines, just aren't worth it.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.520]   That's why you use Genie+ for it.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.200]   - And is Disney Publishing kind of in the app
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.060]   all the wait times for all the rides,
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.040]   even the non-Genie+ ones, at any time,
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.240]   so you can kind of look and say,
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.840]   "What's gonna be easy now?"
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.200]   - Yes, they are.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.940]   Whether those wait times are accurate is another question,
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.240]   but generally speaking,
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.120]   they're a good guideline to work off of.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.440]   Touring Plans, that subscription service
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.280]   I mentioned earlier as well,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.520]   they also keep track of wait times.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.120]   So that is something you can use kind of in tandem
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.840]   with the official Disney World or Disneyland apps,
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.840]   if you'd like to.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.220]   And then once you get used to it,
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.860]   actually, you can start to be able
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.600]   to eyeball some of these lines.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.000]   I mean, I go to Disneyland all the time,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.200]   and I can look at it,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.160]   and if it says, you know, "It's a 60-minute wait,"
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.920]   I'm like, "Nah, it's a 20-minute wait."
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.040]   I know. (laughs)
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.500]   - And Touring Plans, do they also publish historical stuff,
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.660]   so you can kind of see what is it gonna be like
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.180]   on a typical day, so you kind of plan ahead,
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.120]   or do you need to just wait 'til you're in the moment?
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.480]   - Not as much with them.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.600]   A site that you can look at historical information on
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.000]   is called ThrillData.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.160]   It's thrill-data.com.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.320]   I love that site.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.920]   They track all of the metrics for all the Disney parks,
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.660]   a lot of other theme parks as well.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.420]   And so you can see things like,
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.360]   they have a Lightning Lane availability map,
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.840]   and you can go onto the map,
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.640]   and you can see in color-coded bars that,
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.960]   "Oh, you know what?
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.560]   "This time of year,
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.780]   "Space Mountain availability is really good in the morning,
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.660]   "but then starting in the afternoon,
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.580]   "those Lightning Lanes start to run out."
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.020]   So you can see how early in the day,
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.560]   like, "Oh, I've gotta get Space Mountain.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.400]   "You know what?
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.220]   "I really gotta get it before lunch."
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.060]   Or, "Know what?
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:27.900]   "I can wait until 3 or 4 p.m.,
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.980]   "and there's still gonna be Space Mountain Lightning Lanes
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.980]   "left for me to ride."
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.400]   - Is there a ride that you're always like,
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.780]   "This is the one due first,"
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.780]   or are there a couple hard and fast rules
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.340]   that you're like, "If you're doing Disney,
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.180]   "here's the thing"?
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.100]   Telling my friend who's already gotten the overview,
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.900]   but just wants to know a couple things,
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.220]   like, "Don't forget to do X."
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:47.860]   - At Disneyland, I'm always doing Fantasyland rides first.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.260]   None of those are on Genie+,
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.060]   so this is like little dark rides,
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.560]   like Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland,
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.620]   and Dumbo and Snow White, those kind of attractions.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.800]   I'm doing those first at Rope Drop,
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.980]   which is right when the park opens,
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.780]   or even during early entry, if I have early entry.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.340]   That's what I'm doing there.
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:09.900]   At other parks, I'm doing a ride
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.280]   that I would book on Genie+,
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.260]   but that I'm not going to book on Genie+.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.340]   So, say I'm going to Hollywood Studios.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.620]   I mentioned Slinky Dog Dash is a ride
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.260]   that often sells out almost right away on Genie+.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.060]   Well, maybe I'm booking a Genie+
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.140]   for something else in that park,
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.460]   and then I'm making a Mad Dash to Slinky Dog Dash
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.540]   to be able to ride that.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.660]   - And is this like a Black Friday, doors open Mad Dash,
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.420]   or is this just like a brisk walk?
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.260]   - It depends.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.380]   (laughing)
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.260]   Depends on who I'm with.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.740]   You can do a brisk walk with kids.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.900]   If you're Rope Dropping Peter Pan at Disneyland,
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.580]   there is not time to park the stroller.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.420]   Somebody's got the kid on the back,
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.700]   and you're making a Mad Dash,
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.240]   and the other parent is flinging the stroller,
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.420]   and you're getting in the line.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.720]   This is if you really want to optimize it.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.780]   If you do park the stroller,
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.340]   maybe you'll have a 15-minute wait.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.300]   If you don't park the stroller,
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.820]   maybe you'll have a five-minute wait.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.100]   - I feel like there's a YouTube video
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.300]   I want to go watch after this
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.740]   of parents Mad Dashing with their children.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.500]   - It's fun, and you'll hear cast members,
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.460]   "Don't run!"
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.620]   But everybody's power walking
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.540]   like you've never seen them power walk before.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.380]   - Oh, that's amazing.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.900]   Okay, we covered rides.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.740]   What about food?
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.020]   I feel like this is an area
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.700]   where I actually have no knowledge.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.660]   I haven't talked to anyone about it,
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.700]   and I feel like you've said
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.020]   you haven't even tried all the restaurants.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.540]   So how do people even start to think about eating meals
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.300]   while doing a theme park?
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.980]   - So generally speaking,
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:28.660]   there are two different types of restaurants
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.100]   that people are gonna be eating their meals at.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.300]   I mean, there are table service,
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.580]   like the tablecloth waiter kind of restaurants,
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.500]   and then there are quick service restaurants
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.180]   where you're going up to a counter
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.660]   and you're ordering kind of like mall food court.
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   So some people really treat Disney as a dining destination
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.580]   and want to try all of these fancy restaurants,
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.100]   and some of the restaurants are quite good.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.780]   I mean, I don't really think of like Central Florida
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.420]   as being like a foodie destination.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.660]   I mean, California more so,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.300]   but like people don't think about theme parks
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.540]   as being places where you're gonna eat great food,
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.660]   but you actually can.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.500]   So some people really make this a big part of the vacation,
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.780]   and then Disney has what we call character meals as well.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.260]   So you can go to a meal
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.460]   and see all of your favorite Disney characters.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.020]   So you can kind of check some boxes for kids,
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.420]   like get them fed and get them to see something Disney
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.260]   at the same time.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.660]   So this is something that a lot of people do.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.820]   The basic thing is to not overdo it on the food.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.580]   Some people, you don't want to eat
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.580]   two or three table service meals a day.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.700]   You're gonna just be stuffed,
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.260]   especially if you're going like to Florida
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.180]   in the summertime.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.020]   That's not fun.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.860]   That's not, doesn't make for a good vacation,
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.940]   riding roller coasters afterwards.
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.620]   But I tend to plan one table service meal a day
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.700]   for my family.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.180]   So I'll pre-book reservations.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.140]   Reservations open 60 days in advance.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.820]   It used to be like 180 days,
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.100]   which that was ridiculous to have to plan
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.620]   that far in advance.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.060]   So book one reservation a day
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.700]   and then go with the flow for the rest of it.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.940]   I mean, these counter service restaurants,
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.460]   you could just walk up on the fly.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.460]   You can also do something called mobile ordering
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.660]   in the app where you place an order
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.420]   and you pick a time window to return,
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.500]   just like you pick a time window to return to a ride
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   and you can go and your food's ready quicker.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.260]   I love doing that with kids, especially,
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.460]   so they don't have to wait in line.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.820]   - When it comes to the table service,
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.260]   any highlights of kind of best meals?
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.420]   - In Florida, I love Skipper Canteen,
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.860]   which is a restaurant in Magic Kingdom.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.740]   It's, if you know the Jungle Cruise,
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.380]   where they tell the corny jokes,
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:28.780]   the waiters do the same kind of thing at Skipper Canteen.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.380]   So you get a little bit of entertainment,
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.340]   you get really good food.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.220]   Like the food is kind of a little bit like Asian,
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.540]   a little bit, I don't even really know how to explain it.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.700]   It's exotic enough, but still familiar enough
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.900]   that your kids can eat like chicken fingers.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.340]   So good for the adults.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.940]   You got like Bao Buns, things like that,
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.460]   which I love Skipper Canteen.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.500]   I mean, everybody sort of likes to eat it,
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.380]   like the character meals.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.900]   The big ones are Ohana in the Polynesian Resort.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.220]   Chef Mickey's is another popular one.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.500]   Cinderella's Royal Table,
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.980]   which is the expensive one in the castle at Disney World.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.500]   So lots and lots of choices for meals,
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.540]   from the low end to the high end.
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.660]   - And so you mentioned in the Polynesian Resort,
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.780]   does that mean that some of these kind of
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:12.660]   nicer dinners or lunches are not actually in the park,
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.260]   that you can kind of, maybe if you have young kids,
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.380]   go back, relax a few hours,
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.220]   and then have one of these
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.860]   without having to trek all the way back in?
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.220]   - Yes, every deluxe resort that I can think of,
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.660]   I think all of them, have a table service restaurant in them.
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:32.740]   Every hotel has at least a quick service restaurant in them.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.460]   So if you're staying at one of the value resorts,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.740]   you at least have a food court
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.820]   that you can go to and feed the kids.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.760]   So, I mean, most families are going to eat some,
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.700]   if not many of their meals in the hotel restaurants.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:46.860]   And some of the best ones are there,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.820]   like Animal Kingdom Lodge,
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.980]   that has got two great restaurants, Sanaa and Boma.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.140]   Those are some of the most highly rated restaurants
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.300]   so even if you're not staying in that hotel,
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.580]   you might be traveling to that hotel to eat a meal there.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.180]   - And when you say most highly rated,
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.300]   what source of ratings would you tell someone to use?
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.540]   - Touring Plans has actually got some ratings.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.540]   Some of these restaurants will make the usual
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:10.700]   food zagged or whatever, those kind of ratings as well.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.660]   I'm not much of a foodie,
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.380]   so I'm not paying as much attention to this.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.540]   I just know the types of food that I like.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.540]   But yes, I mean, you will see,
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.540]   there's generally an accepted convention among Disney fans.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.700]   This restaurant is one of the better ones.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.780]   The chef is good, it's been consistent over the years.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.500]   These are the ones that you don't wanna eat at as much
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.460]   because it's just gonna be like overcooked hamburgers
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.380]   and chicken fingers.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.140]   - And if you were going with no kids
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.180]   and it was just adults, is there a place you're like,
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.140]   this is where we'd go?
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.340]   - There's a lot of places.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.100]   (laughs)
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.700]   At Disneyland, 'cause I haven't mentioned
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.300]   any restaurants there, Napa Rose is a great restaurant
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.540]   and that's in the Grand Californian Hotel,
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:50.080]   so you don't have to have a park ticket to go eat there.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.640]   Gosh, Lamplight Lounge, that's an in-the-park restaurant
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.080]   at California Adventure.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.480]   I mean, there's some really fancy ones.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.600]   There's one called Victoria and Albert's
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.680]   that is impossible to get a reservation to
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.400]   and it's going to be several hundred dollars per person.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.760]   It's in the Grand Floridian Resort in Florida.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.480]   So that's like a super sought after one
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.360]   if you're like a real foodie who loves,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.280]   like say you would go to like French Laundry,
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.800]   something like that, it would be that kind of experience.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.520]   - And you say impossible to get a reservation,
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.880]   you have to book 60 days out.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.920]   Are there any ways to find last minute reservations?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.600]   I'm sure people are canceling.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.880]   Any way to optimize that if you didn't plan well?
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.680]   - Yes, I love a service called Mouse Dining.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.000]   What you do is you put in the restaurant
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.360]   that you wanna eat at and the time of day
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.360]   and it automatically checks for you.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.960]   They have a free version that will then send you
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.320]   email alerts and then you can just go in and book it
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.840]   as soon as you get the email.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.400]   But if you really are trying to get something competitive,
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   I think it's worth it to pay like a small nominal amount
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.080]   per month to get the paid version.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.440]   I think it's maybe like seven or $10, it's not much money.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.360]   And then they'll send you text alerts
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.880]   and then you can immediately jump in
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.480]   and book that reservation.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.500]   I actually used it recently to get a reservation
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.280]   at Blue Bayou, which is a very sought after restaurant
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.200]   in Disneyland that is in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.000]   So a lot of people really enjoy eating there.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.120]   - Okay, I love that.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.480]   Can you bring your own food?
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.280]   - Yeah, you can bring your own food.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.960]   Disney doesn't disallow it like a lot of theme parks do.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.560]   A lot of people will do that for breakfast,
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.640]   like pack in granola bars or things like that
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.880]   just so you can eat on the run and get the rides in
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.360]   when the lines are short.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.520]   But I mean, you also can just do very easygoing,
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.720]   quick service food.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.040]   I mean, you can share like chicken fingers
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.160]   or there's a lot of things that you can grab and go
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.580]   and it's expensive, it's theme park food,
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.900]   but it's not like game changingly expensive.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.840]   I mean, my family often will share meals,
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.640]   especially when our kids were younger.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.340]   You know, we'd order two adult entrees
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.720]   and then, you know, share with the kids
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.520]   or even like as an adult,
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.680]   you can always order at the quick service restaurants.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.800]   You can order a kid's meal
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.040]   and that's a whole lot cheaper
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.760]   than ordering an adult entree and say that way.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.580]   - I like it.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.600]   Any other tips when it comes to food and drink?
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.680]   You know, can you bring a water bottle,
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.440]   refill it places easily?
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.220]   - Yeah, that's not a problem.
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.640]   Water fountains and things like that.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.160]   And ice water is free at like quick service locations.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.260]   You can get that included as well.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.040]   So yeah, I mean, Disney's very generous.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.100]   So if you're used to like the rules of your local Six Flags
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.660]   or something like that,
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.500]   Disney's not gonna be that strict
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.660]   about those kinds of things.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.460]   And I'd say pack in the baby food.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.820]   That's one thing that if you have young kids,
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.680]   that's a little harder to like figure out.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.380]   And like, if you need like a kid who needs whole milk,
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.020]   pack that, that's gonna be harder to find than like 2%.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.300]   - And then what about Club 33?
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.200]   (laughs)
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.200]   - You know, you gotta be a member or know a member.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.580]   So yeah, there's this club that Walt Disney founded
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.780]   to entertain VIPs.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.280]   And the original one is in Disneyland Park.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.740]   They actually now have one in Disney World as well,
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.460]   but they're different memberships.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:52.700]   But it's a club above Pirates of the Caribbean
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.840]   in New Orleans Square at Disneyland.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.420]   And you have to be a member to be able to eat there
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.500]   or a member can like sponsor you to take you in.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.020]   I've eaten there once and it's lovely.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020]   It's a great experience.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.980]   And you get to like kind of behind the scenes experience,
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.100]   but it's hard to guarantee that there's a way to do it
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.100]   unless you know somebody.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.740]   - I have heard that it is one of the more,
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.100]   if not the most sought after Disney experience.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.300]   It is very difficult to track down.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.380]   I have heard some high-end travel agents
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.380]   have ways to make it happen,
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.880]   but it starts at like a thousand dollars a person
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.100]   in terms of getting in.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.280]   So just to set some expectations,
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.340]   if you don't find the organic way of a person
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.420]   who's actually a member who can hook you up,
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.060]   we're talking thousands of dollars.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:36.900]   - Yeah.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.200]   Those kinds of things, those are still like very gray hat.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.100]   Disney can and will shut that down at some point.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.180]   If you're gonna do something like that,
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.100]   you be aware that it may blow up in your face.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.020]   Like it may not work out.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.420]   - But there's no sanctioned way,
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.740]   like a Disney VIP tour,
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.520]   just to be clear, we talked about earlier,
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.980]   that is through Disney.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.220]   That's, you know, something sanctioned,
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.120]   a travel agent can book it for you, all of that stuff.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.220]   But there's no kind of way to do Club 33 legitimately
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.380]   without knowing the right person.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.940]   - No, unfortunately not.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.180]   I mean, I guess you could get yourself on the list to join
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.340]   and be on the wait list
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.340]   and pay many, many thousands and thousands of dollars.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.180]   I guess that's the way in.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.100]   You can always buy your way in.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.420]   In fact, I should mention that we were actually on the list
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.860]   to join back in the day,
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.260]   like before people knew about it,
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.900]   20 years ago when I was in law school,
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.740]   my husband, he put ourselves on the list
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.660]   and it cost a lot less then.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.700]   But by the time we came up for membership,
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.060]   the cost had about quadrupled.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.980]   So we said no.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.380]   - Any other kind of unique VIP experiences?
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.780]   You talked about character meals.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.580]   We talked about the VIP tours.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.820]   - Ooh, I mean, those are the big ones.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.140]   I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.780]   I mean, there are something called after hours events
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.420]   that they aren't really VIP,
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.380]   but this is when Disney closes the park early
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.500]   and then sells tickets to that same park to other people.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.620]   But there are much fewer people
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.980]   that go to these after hours events.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.420]   So the lines are shorter.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.460]   So a lot of people will actually do that
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.100]   as a way to just get in.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.060]   Like there used to be an after hours event in Animal Kingdom
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.140]   where you could probably ride Flight of Passage,
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.620]   which is the big ride there,
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.700]   three and four times if that's what you wanted to do.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.940]   And you just can't really do that on a regular park day.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.820]   - Okay, I've heard about some behind the scenes tours,
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:11.660]   that kind of stuff.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.940]   - Oh yeah, there are other tours.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.940]   I mean, those are kind of cousins of VIP tours.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.420]   So there's something called like in Disneyland,
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.900]   a walk in Walt's footsteps,
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.540]   where it's a short tour, like two hours,
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.780]   and they'll take you to a couple of special spots.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.140]   Like that's when you might get to see,
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.460]   like there's an apartment that Walt had
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.100]   over Main Street USA at Disneyland.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.540]   So you could get to go and like see that apartment
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.580]   in one of the tours,
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.260]   but you're not getting to ride a lot of rides necessarily.
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.820]   Maybe you're getting like one fast pass,
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.100]   depending upon what the tour is.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.020]   And some of these are like more within reach,
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.860]   like a couple hundred dollars a person,
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.300]   but you're not going to like be able to use those tours
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.380]   to like maximize as an entire vacation.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.700]   They're just kind of an extra add on
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.180]   for people who are like interested maybe in the history,
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.820]   or maybe want some sort of a specialty experience
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.300]   for something they're super interested in.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.020]   Like there's a tour at Halloween time,
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.860]   if they wanna focus on the Halloween details of Disneyland.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.100]   - So we talked about rides and food and tours,
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.660]   but what about all the other stuff in Disney?
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.460]   I know there's kind of meeting the characters,
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:07.860]   seeing the fireworks.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.780]   What are other things people should be thinking about
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.020]   or maybe need to plan?
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.980]   - There's all of that.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.140]   There are a lot of like live shows as well,
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.780]   where you can like a stage show,
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:18.980]   where you can see characters or sing alongs,
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.940]   things like that.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:23.660]   So you'll quickly figure out what your family likes to do.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:24.940]   Like my family is a ride family.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.140]   We're riding and we will skip the fireworks.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.260]   We will skip the stage shows.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:29.100]   I mean, we'll see them.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.380]   I mean, and there are parades, things like that as well.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.980]   So figure out what you wanna do.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.900]   I think with younger kids,
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.220]   they're gonna get more utility out of seeing
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.340]   maybe their favorite princess
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.940]   or their favorite character in a parade
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.140]   than your teenager will.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.940]   Your teenager's gonna wanna ride
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.900]   all of the roller coasters as much as possible.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.500]   So adjust your vacation based upon who you're with
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   and don't be afraid to split up.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.740]   My family actually does this
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:55.460]   because we have a 14-year-old who loves thrill rides
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.260]   and we have a 10-year-old who is very cautious.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:00.540]   So there will be times where I will take the 10-year-old
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.820]   on the slow rides
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.500]   and my husband will take the 14-year-old on every coaster.
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.340]   - I wanna come back to kids,
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.820]   but I just, something popped in my head.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.460]   One of my memories as a kid was in Epcot
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.980]   and eating at all these different countries.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.380]   We didn't really talk about that when we came to food.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.140]   How do you think about that experience?
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.820]   Is Epcot more of a place to walk around and eat
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.700]   or is it a theme park with lots of rides?
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.220]   I kind of have a vague memory of visiting as a child.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.980]   - It's a hybrid and it's changed
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.380]   and it's changing right now.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.780]   We're kind of in the middle of the Epcot 2.0 re-imagining.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.740]   There's a lot of construction
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.380]   still being finished up there.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.940]   There is the half of Epcot that is World Showcase,
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.780]   that has got all of these different country pavilions,
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.540]   each with a lot of great restaurants
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:44.540]   and there are food festivals most of the year happening
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.260]   in that part of the park as well,
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.860]   where they have booths outside of the countries as well.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.820]   So that's gonna be like a big, big foodie destination.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.500]   I often will eat dinner like every meal on a trip at Epcot
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.820]   just because there's so much choice
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.260]   and there's so many different flavors there
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.660]   because of it being around the world.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.060]   And then there's the whole other front half of Epcot
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.620]   that's being transformed right now, a lot of construction.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.300]   When I was a kid, it was like the super geeky '80s,
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.300]   like let's learn something.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.740]   Now, like more of the Disney IP is being brought in
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.900]   and Disney's trying to sort of figure out what that is
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.100]   and what that's gonna be.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.820]   But yeah, I mean, I guess the safest thing
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:22.340]   is it's kind of the futuristic Disney
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.700]   and there's some rides there as well that are worth doing,
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.980]   but the per capita rides, not as high as what you'd find
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.460]   in Hollywood Studios or in Magic Kingdom.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.220]   - And going back to kids, I guess first,
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.420]   what age do you think it makes sense
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.900]   to actually start considering bringing kids to Disney?
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.180]   And what do parents need to know
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.500]   about a Disney trip with children?
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.300]   - So I always say the best age to take a kid
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.020]   for their first trip to Disney
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:51.020]   is when they are two years and 364 days old.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.100]   And that's because when they turn three,
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.580]   you have to get a ticket for them.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.020]   So the best time to go is right before they turn three
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:58.980]   for your first vacation.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.700]   I'm assuming you're taking more than one vacation
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.140]   over the course of their lives
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.260]   because they're not gonna remember
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.220]   the one that they take when they're almost three.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.980]   But at that age, a lot of kids know Disney characters,
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.860]   they have their favorites, they believe that they are real.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860]   And you as a parent seeing that
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   is absolutely priceless in my opinion.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.500]   So I think it's really worth it
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.180]   if you can afford to take more than one vacation to do it.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.420]   And I think if you're deciding between land and world,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.620]   land is the place to do it.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.100]   It's much more manageable at that age
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.180]   'cause they're still napping when they're almost three.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.620]   If you're not doing that,
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.740]   then I'd say wait until their grade school,
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.500]   like six or seven.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.820]   You're gonna miss that magical age a little bit,
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.660]   but you're just gonna be able to do much more.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.260]   They're gonna be tall enough to ride more of the rides.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.020]   So like, I'd say aim for that
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.140]   if it's like a trip once in a lifetime.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.380]   I mean, maybe seven, eight, nine, somewhere in that range.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.820]   So with younger kids, pay for convenience,
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.660]   pay for ones that have the transportation connections
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.020]   or the proximity, it's worth it.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:58.860]   It's really worth it,
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.100]   especially if you have to go back for a midday nap.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.860]   My firstborn would not nap in the stroller.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.140]   We had to go back for a midday nap every day
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.340]   when she was younger.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.220]   Second kid, eh, nap in the stroller.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.500]   I think it's worth it for that.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.460]   But I mean, don't try to do too much.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.380]   Be realistic about, you can't start early every morning
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.460]   and then close down every park with fireworks every night.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.820]   I think it's really important,
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.580]   especially on a longer vacation, to plan in a break day.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.380]   Like I took a five-day trip with my son
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.380]   last summer to Disney World.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.220]   And he's older, I mean, he's 10 now.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:31.980]   And we took a one day in the middle of a trip
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.260]   where we just didn't go to a park.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.340]   Instead, we swam in the hotel pool.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.740]   We went to a character meal at one of the hotels,
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.220]   but we didn't go to a park and we didn't wake up early
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.660]   and we didn't go to bed late.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.140]   And that's a great way to reset.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.300]   - And you talked about character meals at hotels.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.060]   Do you need to plan your day
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.180]   if your kid really wants to meet,
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:50.300]   I don't know, Mickey or someone?
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.780]   Like, is that just gonna happen?
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.580]   Like, can you just assume that whatever character
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.540]   you wanna find, you're gonna see at some point
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.820]   or is that something to plan?
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:57.660]   - You need to plan it.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.540]   And some of the character meet and greets
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.220]   are actually attractions that are on Genie+.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.340]   So you can book them using Genie+.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.140]   Like there's a princess meet and greet
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.380]   in Disney Magic Kingdom that you can book
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.900]   several different princess options.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.300]   So some of those you want to just book
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.380]   to make sure they happen.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.460]   And then otherwise you can look on the Disneyland app.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.620]   You can see where certain characters
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.940]   tend to have their meet and greets
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.100]   if they're ones that are a little bit less formal,
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.860]   but there will be cues for some of these characters.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:25.820]   I mean, the popular ones,
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.100]   especially like a new movie has just come out,
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.420]   there will be a long line for that.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.820]   So be prepared.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.180]   - What about just things to bring, not to bring?
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.060]   Obviously we talked about strollers.
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.380]   Is that always the move over like a carrier
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.220]   or a backpack or something like that?
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.980]   - I mean, I'd say if you have a young infant,
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.860]   then a carrier makes sense.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.220]   But if you're at the sort of toddler stage,
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.060]   then you're gonna wanna have a stroller.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.780]   I mean, people are using strollers at Disney
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.220]   far longer than they're using strollers anywhere else.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:56.060]   I'd say for me, like up until about age five,
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.140]   we would sometimes use a stroller in Disney parks.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.460]   And I've even seen friends use them
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.700]   at like six and seven year olds.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.540]   I made my kids walk at that age, tough mom.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.820]   But especially if you're planning to stay out late,
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.580]   like you'll need somewhere for the kid to pass out.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.740]   So even when my son was about to enter kindergarten,
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.620]   we wouldn't use a stroller most of the time.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.580]   But if we went to a nighttime event,
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:17.700]   we'd have a stroller for that.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.540]   So yeah, you need that.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.620]   And just be realistic about the number of steps
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.460]   they can take.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.740]   I mean, I have done 30,000 steps on a Disney day by myself.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:29.260]   And I don't think most kids can do that.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.540]   Certainly not day after day.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.380]   - I know my kids definitely could not.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.980]   Any tips if you have a large group, but not a family?
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.180]   - Try not to micromanage that group too much.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.300]   Like make your hotel reservation together,
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.460]   like make a dining reservation
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.260]   for a couple of meals together,
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.500]   but then let people do their own thing.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.740]   Because even my family of four, like I'm telling you,
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.060]   we're splitting up because we have different interests
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.060]   some of the time.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:55.220]   If you're trying to move a group of like 12 or 15 people,
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.540]   you are going to be so slow moving.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.700]   And it's going to mean that you sacrifice
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.900]   getting a lot of rides in that you might want to do
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.740]   or experiences you might want to do.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.940]   So like pick a couple of different point people
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.420]   for that group and make sure like two or three of you
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.980]   know how to use GeniePlus.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.740]   And then let people plan their own day at that point.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.020]   - You mentioned experiences.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.460]   And it just reminded me that about six months ago,
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.340]   a bunch of friends of mine went down to Disneyland
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.340]   and they went and like made lightsabers.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.820]   Any other kind of experiences that people may not realize
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.420]   both exist or that you need to plan in advance?
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.180]   - There are a lot of little things like that,
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.660]   you know, based upon your interest.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.460]   I mean, Star Wars definitely took those experiences
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.300]   up a level.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.340]   You can make a droid as well,
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.500]   but that you don't really have to pre-book in advance.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.140]   You can just walk in and build your own BB-8
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.060]   or something like that, which is really cool.
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.260]   All those tours that I mentioned,
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.900]   the walk in Walt's footsteps or the character meals,
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.900]   all of those you should book in advance.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.420]   You might find openings last minute, but you might not.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.540]   So I think it's important to think about those experiences.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.900]   I'm trying to think if there's, I mean,
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.460]   there are plenty of other little experiences
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.700]   that you can do on the fly.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.460]   Like one of the things I love to do in Disneyland,
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.300]   there's a little silhouette studio on Main Street USA
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.980]   where there's an artist who will cut a silhouette
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.020]   of you or your child, a profile.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.180]   And you can just queue up there and stand in line.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.660]   And we did that on our last trip.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.500]   And we've done that every few years with my kids.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.220]   We have a wall full of silhouettes of them
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:23.140]   at different ages and stages, and it's very inexpensive.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.740]   So look for like little things like that.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.380]   Those are what I think make the trip magical.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.900]   And there's so many of those,
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.380]   even that I'm still discovering, right?
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.180]   I mean, there's so many little things
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.180]   that Disney tucks in the nooks and crannies
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.740]   because it's such a big resort.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.860]   I mean, both of them are such big resorts
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.580]   that if you see something that looks interesting to you,
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.740]   dive in and do it.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:47.820]   Forget about that Genie+, maybe once in a while.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.420]   - My wife worked at Lyft for 10 years
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.220]   and she led the partnership with Disney.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.060]   Her biggest takeaway is that Disney just cares so much
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.260]   about the experience and hospitality.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.420]   And like, you might see something small and think,
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:00.500]   "Oh, that's not worth it."
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.980]   Her perspective was like, if it's there,
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.780]   someone at Disney intentionally wanted it to be there.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.580]   And so there's probably something interesting to see.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.420]   - Yeah, and it's funny you should mention Lyft
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.380]   because Disney has partnered with Lyft at Disney World
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.860]   to offer something called minivans.
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.300]   It's basically like Uber,
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.340]   but it's driven by Disney cast members
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.260]   and it operates on the Lyft platform.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.260]   Those are some of my best experiences
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.780]   are riding in a minivan
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.540]   because the cast members who drive them
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.740]   are some of the absolute best that Disney has.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.300]   And they will play games with your kids
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.860]   and they will tell you cool trivia.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.500]   Look for moments like that.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.860]   Yeah, my kids' minivans
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.420]   are one of their best Disney memories in recent years.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.780]   - My wife will love hearing this
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.900]   because I believe that that was one of the things
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.660]   that came out of the partnership she worked on.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.460]   So that is so cool to hear.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.660]   - Yeah, awesome.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.540]   - And the last thing we didn't talk about,
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:51.100]   but you briefly said the word souvenirs earlier.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.180]   I think that's something that kind of comes up all the time.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.540]   I feel like it's like souvenirs are really expensive,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.900]   but kids always want them.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.380]   Any thoughts on either optimizing or saving
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.780]   in the souvenir department?
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.460]   - For younger kids, buy them in advance at Target.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.060]   (laughing)
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.460]   You know, one thing that we used to do actually
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:13.260]   when our kids were very young is Tinkerbell would come
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.740]   and visit our hotel room every night.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.500]   Just like Easter Bunny or Santa Claus,
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.540]   Tinkerbell would drop off something each morning
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.540]   of a Disney vacation.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.860]   So think about that.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.340]   Think about whether Tinkerbell is something
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.140]   that you wanna tap for your Disney vacations.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.420]   And then they have something special
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.900]   that they don't need to buy everything
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.740]   in the souvenir stores and the parks.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.420]   But just set a budget in advance.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.460]   You can buy discount Disney gift cards
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.740]   in advance of your trip.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.340]   Even just if you have like a Target red card,
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.220]   go to Target, they're 5% off.
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.780]   You're saving a little bit here and there.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.140]   There are other ways that you can hack Disney gift cards
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.260]   to a greater amount.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.060]   So you can at least be saving that amount
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.940]   on your souvenirs when you spend a Disney gift card
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:49.900]   in a souvenir shop.
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.900]   So there's some ways around the margins.
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.260]   I mean, there are like some discount stores.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.700]   There's one in Orlando where souvenirs that didn't sell
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.580]   go to die, but there's some really great stuff there.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.060]   But that car is going off site.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.500]   Unless you're a real Disney super fan
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.180]   or have a longer vacation, it's not worth it.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.020]   - Okay.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.460]   And you mentioned the discount gift cards.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.700]   I know someone's listening is like,
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.220]   Chris better follow up because you said
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.860]   there are other ways to hack that even better.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.100]   So I'm gonna just push on that to see what they are.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:12.940]   - Okay.
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.220]   Well, they change a lot.
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:15.980]   I actually have a blog post on my site
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.580]   and we can hopefully leave a link in the show notes
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.620]   that has all the current ways to hack Disney gift cards,
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.900]   ways to get them on the cheap,
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.820]   but it's part of travel hacking.
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.900]   I mean, there are ways you can get them
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.460]   at Sam's Club at a discount
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.820]   and you're using the right credit card
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.740]   that gives you a certain point at Sam's Club.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.580]   So things like that.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.140]   It's combining different reward systems together
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.700]   where maybe you're getting like a cashback
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.860]   or points in another way
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.700]   and then you're getting them at a discount as well.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.620]   - We will absolutely link to that in the show notes.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.900]   Is that something you can use to buy your park passes,
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.100]   your Genie Plus also, or only in the park?
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.900]   - Yeah, you can use them for any Disney purchase,
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.940]   but most people for the tickets at least,
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.020]   a lot of people will buy from the discount resellers.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.980]   There's some companies like Getaway Today,
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.220]   Undercover Tourist, a couple of other ones
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.140]   where you can buy discount tickets.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.220]   And sometimes the savings from them
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:08.700]   are more than you could get from a Disney gift card,
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.220]   depending upon what the percentage savings
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.740]   you can get on that gift card are.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.060]   - So you're not buying your Disney park tickets
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.420]   at the Disneyland website or the Disney World website?
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:19.180]   - Not usually, unless I'm using a travel agent
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:20.220]   to book a whole package.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.060]   So the trade-off is you pay the rack rate
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.100]   if you have from Disney,
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.940]   but you get the guidance of a travel agent
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.060]   booking your whole package or you DIY it yourself.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.140]   You're not getting that guidance
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.620]   and you're booking through Getaway Today
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.740]   or Undercover Tourist.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.700]   Depends on what the savings are.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.700]   And sometimes the savings for like a short vacation
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.700]   are only like five or 10 bucks a ticket,
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.260]   maybe not worth it for you.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.940]   But if you're going for a longer vacation,
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.820]   then they could be, or you have a bigger family,
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:43.740]   they really can add up,
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.460]   especially if you can buy them during a sale.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:49.300]   - Any other cost-saving optimizations that we missed
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.540]   that you're just kind of like,
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.180]   "Oh, we can't believe we forgot that one."
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.020]   - Oh gosh.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.500]   - Let me say, I know you have a whole podcast to cover them,
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.660]   so we can leave people there.
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:57.620]   - For sure, for sure.
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.740]   So we regularly are covering new ways.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:00.580]   I mean, I mentioned like,
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.900]   just check for these kinds of deals.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.660]   I mentioned that 50% off kids deal right now
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.660]   that they have going for early 2024 at Disneyland.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.100]   So look at those kinds of things.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.740]   I mean, often Disney will have hotel sales,
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.820]   25% off rooms at deluxe resorts
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.540]   if you go during a slower time of year.
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.620]   So look for those things
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.860]   and a good travel agent will let you know
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.180]   when a sale like that is released
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.260]   and apply it to your room,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.980]   even if you've already booked it with them.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.660]   - Are you publishing all of these on your blog,
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.820]   mentioning them in the podcast?
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.540]   Where can people make sure they're not missing out?
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.260]   - I'm covering more of these in the podcast
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.220]   because they're changing in real time.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:34.500]   But sometimes it's easy as just running the search
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.300]   on Disney's website and seeing there's a big banner
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.140]   that there's a sale going on or something like that.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.780]   But yeah, definitely on the podcast,
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.300]   we're covering the big ones that when they come out
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:44.020]   and not as much on the blog
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:46.060]   because these things are changing too much
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.180]   to be able to like cover them in real time there.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.980]   - We talked almost exclusively
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.780]   about Disneyland and Disney World.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.060]   I know there's four parks around the world.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.900]   The only park that I remember recent past was in Paris.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.740]   How do you think about the international park
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:00.100]   and are they a letdown if you've been to the ones here
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.140]   or are they amazing?
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.300]   Are they go out of your way
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.820]   while traveling to check them out?
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.540]   - So thus far, I've only been to half
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.380]   of the international parks.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.580]   I've been to Disneyland Paris
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.100]   and I've been to Hong Kong Disneyland.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.300]   I am planning a trip right now to Tokyo Disneyland
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:15.660]   for spring break next year.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.700]   So I'll at least get three of the four very, very soon.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.580]   But to me, they haven't been a letdown
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.740]   because I love seeing how Disney
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.700]   is translated around the world.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.860]   Hong Kong Disneyland, I went there in 2014
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:29.780]   when my daughter was five years old.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:32.020]   And that was an amazing experience.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.140]   It's the smallest of all the parks around the world.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.180]   And at that point it was much smaller than it even is now.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.220]   They're adding a lot more right now,
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.740]   but it was so memorable to see.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:45.940]   Jungle Cruise was available in three different languages.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:46.900]   Like you would get in a line
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.220]   as to whether you were gonna do English
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.620]   or Cantonese or Mandarin.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.380]   And that was just such a unique...
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.500]   And all the skippers could speak all three languages.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.060]   So seeing things like that, I mean, it's just part of travel.
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.780]   It's a smaller part of world travel.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.780]   And I never would take a trip just to go to a Disney park.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.220]   I mean, we went to Paris and we did Paris
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.580]   and we did London, the same trip,
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:08.020]   but we spent a day and a half, two days at Disneyland Paris.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.540]   So it's an add-on to enrich
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.220]   those international experiences, I think.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.060]   - I love it.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.260]   I feel like a whole new world is about to unlock
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.660]   with two young daughters
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.580]   who are gonna get to experience these things.
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.660]   And on your trip to Japan,
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.420]   I'm gonna send you a link to the episode and post we did
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.860]   with so much information.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.460]   Hopefully that could be helpful.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.260]   I'm obviously a resource if you need it.
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.540]   - Yeah, I saw that post.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.020]   I saw that podcast in the list
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.940]   and I was like, I've already queued it up.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.020]   The planning just started.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.220]   We just decided this week to make Japan
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.580]   our spring break destination.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.740]   - Oh, you're gonna have so much fun.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.340]   You mentioned a sale in 2024.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:43.020]   Are there any other big changes you think
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.940]   are coming to Disney on the horizon?
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.980]   - So we've mentioned Genie Plus
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:50.420]   and Disney has told us in 2024, they're gonna change it.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.580]   So everything that I've told you so far may be a mood.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.180]   I don't think they're gonna change it that drastically,
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.540]   but they are making changes.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.580]   And I think 2024 is going to be a transition year,
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.380]   especially for the US parks
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.940]   because there's not a lot new coming.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.220]   There's not like a big headliner attraction
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.060]   really that's coming.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.180]   I guess there's maybe Tiana's Bayou Adventure,
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.740]   which is a redo of Splash Mountain.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.740]   But demand has been soft,
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.980]   especially for Walt Disney World right now.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.940]   And Disney's doing things
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:17.780]   to try to tweak the guest experience.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.220]   So I think you're gonna see a lot of little changes
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:23.580]   that may offer some possibilities for deals
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.420]   or offer some possibilities for hacking the parks
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.700]   or making them more efficient.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.700]   So it's not really a banner year for the US parks
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.660]   in terms of big openings.
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:35.980]   Now, the foreign parks, there are a lot of things coming.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.020]   So there's a new land opening in Tokyo in summer.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.220]   Right now, as we're recording,
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:44.220]   they're about to open a new land in Hong Kong Disneyland
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.020]   and Shanghai is getting a Zootopia land very soon as well.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.780]   So a lot happening at the international parks very, very soon.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.180]   So maybe this is the year,
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.940]   if you've done Disneyland or Disney World,
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:57.500]   make your way to an international park.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.340]   - That sounds awesome.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.420]   I forgot one thing I didn't ask earlier.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.460]   Does it ever make sense to consider a season ticket?
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.620]   I know every time I go to a theme park,
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.660]   they're like, "Just for the cost of one more day,
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.140]   you can get an annual pass."
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.580]   - Not unless you're gonna go many days
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:12.820]   at Disneyland or Disney World.
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.940]   Most people I know who have annual passes
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:18.980]   either are locals or they're going two weeks a year.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:19.860]   Probably not worth it.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.740]   It's not the same as Six Flags, definitely not.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.580]   - That's great.
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.580]   Some of those international parks sound amazing.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.500]   I know you did an episode on 2023.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.780]   Can we expect that if any of these changes come out,
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.340]   you'll do an episode on 2024?
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.860]   If Genie+ changes, you'll do another episode there.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.180]   So can we just tell everyone
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.740]   that if they wanna stay on top of more and more Disney,
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.500]   it's just to go subscribe to Disney Deciphered?
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.740]   - Yes, please go to Disney Deciphered, subscribe.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:45.140]   We will have in early 2024 an episode about what's coming,
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.580]   what's new, what are the changes,
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:48.460]   because there are lots of little incremental changes
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:49.340]   that I mentioned.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:50.740]   So go there and subscribe
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:53.940]   and we will redo our Genie+ episode again.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.260]   We have had to redo that thing.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.460]   I can't even tell you how many times.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.300]   So we're waiting.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.060]   We're standing by, ready to do that.
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:00.900]   - Amazing.
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:02.300]   I will link to that in the show notes.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.980]   People are already in a podcast app.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:05.180]   Leslie, thank you for being here.
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.340]   - Thanks for having me.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.540]   - That is so awesome.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.220]   It makes me so excited to take my girls to Disney one day.
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:14.020]   I really hope you all got a lot out of this.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.980]   If there's any Disney hacks, tips, or tricks you have
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:18.460]   that weren't covered here,
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.740]   please send them to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740]   I hope you guys have a happy holiday.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740]   Merry Christmas.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:26.620]   Enjoy time with your family.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:29.020]   And thank you all so much for all your support.
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.340]   I will see you next week.
