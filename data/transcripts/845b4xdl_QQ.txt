[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   I've known about your work for a very long time, admired it for a very long time.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.600]   And one of the things that excited me about being able to sit down with you today is that
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.320]   our laboratory studied breathwork, your laboratory studying breathwork, and I know that you've
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.140]   been doing a study on the so-called Wim Hof method, which I'll let you familiarize our
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.180]   listeners to.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.400]   Some of them are familiar with the Wim Hof method, others are not.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.000]   I think a lot of people think of Wim in terms of his role as the ice man because of cold
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   exposure.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.240]   But of course he has breathwork practices that mirror things like two-mode breathing
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.240]   and other things.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.800]   But maybe you could tell us a little bit about what you're doing there and what you're interested
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   in discovering.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.600]   I realize it's too early to give us the results, but hopefully we'll come back and do that
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   at another time.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960]   But what is the study?
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900]   What motivated the study?
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.020]   And maybe I can convince you to give us a little teaser of what you're discovering.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:02.240]   So for many years, I mean, I think my first paper when I was a graduate student with Bruce
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.440]   McEwen was about this idea of positive physiological stress.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.160]   And so I've always been wanting to really understand what's positive stress, how can
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.680]   we induce it.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.840]   And instead for many, many, too many years, I've been studying the dark side, toxic stress,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.680]   trauma, caregiving, and how that can take a toll on the body without the right resilience
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.240]   and resources.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:39.360]   And now I'm very excited about the opportunity to just focus on different ways that we can
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.720]   stress out our body and mind in short-term bursts that might promote stress resilience.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.440]   And the body-based strategies are concrete, they're quick, they're also my favorite strategies.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.320]   I probably have internalized a lot of the mindsets and the things that I've learned
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.560]   from meditation.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.840]   And what I feel the biggest bang for the buck is if I'm waking up super jittery with a big
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:18.480]   stress response because of X or Y, it is actually something like a HIIT-type workout, or taking
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.760]   the dogs for a really brisk walk, or burning up that energy in my body is a very big effect
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.040]   size for me personally.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.180]   Everyone has their different ways that they can see the biggest shifts in daily stress.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.980]   So I've been looking for ways to create positive stress besides exercise, we all know about
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980]   exercise.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.880]   And I met Wim Hof at a meeting where we talked kind of back to back.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.560]   And so I had kind of heard something about crazy Iceman climbing up the Himalayas.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   I really-
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.240]   I think he has 27 or more world records for that sort of thing.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.360]   So I got to do the breathing with him during this conference.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.600]   And I just felt like elation afterward, I was like, "What was that?"
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.000]   And then he heard about telomeres and he was like, "I need to know if my method is affecting
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   cell aging."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.640]   He loves research.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.600]   And so he helped us design a study that we've been working on at UCSF with my colleagues
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.040]   Wendy Mendez and Eric Prather.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.440]   It's been many years and it's funded by the John W. Brick Foundation, which is very focused
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   on what are non-drug ways that we can help mental health.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.160]   So it was a very good fit for all of us to come together and design the study.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.440]   And we have been basically comparing low arousal relaxation methods, mindfulness, slow breathing
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.880]   to positive stress, exercise and Wim Hof method.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.040]   And one of the things that we've learned in a big way is that regardless of whether we're
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.480]   creating deep states of ease or hermetic stress in the body, that short-term burst of either
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.880]   aerobic activity or the extreme breathing, people feel better, period.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.120]   So three weeks later after this experiment of doing their practice every day, they were
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.560]   either randomly assigned to the high arousal or the low arousal, the level of stress, anxiety
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.140]   and depression fell dramatically in everyone.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.560]   So many paths to changes in stress.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.800]   There are probably very different physiological pathways and we can talk about that more when
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.840]   we get to really look in depth at our physiological data as well as our blood-based data.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.440]   But what we do know is that the Wim Hof method did create daily positive emotion that increased
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.660]   over time, just like your study on sighing.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.880]   And so even though there are different mechanisms, they were selectively boosting feelings of
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   positivity.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.600]   I love that.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.760]   That's very unusual to get a very selective positive effect.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Super interesting.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.920]   I can't wait to hear more about the data.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.520]   So I gather, and by the way, no is a perfectly fine answer.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.160]   I gather that you're not going to tell us about whether or not there are telomere changes
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.120]   yet or maybe that's not possible to detect in this kind of short-term study.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:31.760]   So what we're going to look at, we don't really think that telomeres can change very quickly
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.440]   and telomerase may.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.700]   So we're going to look at mitochondrial enzymes, telomerase and gene expression patterns.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.240]   And as you know, we can look at many different mechanisms and pathways with gene expression
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.680]   patterns, especially with these new kind of assays where you can look at, you know, 7,000
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.040]   different proteins like the somalogic.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.680]   And so we'll get to see, well, what's the pattern, you know, did we really change patterns
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.800]   of acute stress with these different types of stress resilience interventions?
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   And in terms of the physiological reactivity, there are ways that we can examine both the
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.360]   stress response system, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic response system.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.080]   And I will tell you that while we're still preparing the results, there were very different
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.520]   profiles from the different interventions that make us think that there's a lot of specificity.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.480]   Even though everyone feels better, the way that they got there is very different, ways
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:46.040]   that we're impacting both the nervous system and the brain.
