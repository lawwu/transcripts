[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.900]   - Happy Thanksgiving to all of you here in the States.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.400]   Thanksgiving is a Pauline theme that we read about
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.020]   all over in the New Testament, ever relevant for all of us
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.820]   on any day of the week, any day of the year.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.180]   But this national holiday is a fitting time for a question
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.460]   on Romans chapter one, verse 21,
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.080]   and how Godward Thanksgiving,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   or a lack of Godward Thanksgiving,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.160]   shapes the trajectory of our whole lives.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   How is the story of your life told by your Thanksgiving
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.220]   or its absence?
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.480]   This is a great question from a listener
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   who likely isn't celebrating Thanksgiving Day today, James,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.360]   because he lives in the beautiful, rugged peninsula
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.040]   of Cornwall, England.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.440]   Here's his email.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.960]   Pastor John, thank you for your ministry
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.340]   and for this podcast.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.140]   I was wondering if you can explain the logic
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.040]   of the trajectory Paul talks about in Romans chapter one.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.640]   Specifically, I wanna better understand
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.060]   the role of God-centered thanksgiving in verse 21.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000]   Quote, "For although they knew God,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   "they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him."
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.800]   End quote.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.040]   This failure to thank leads to a deeper and deeper
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.880]   sin bondage and greater and greater judgments
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.640]   from God on sinners.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.120]   So my question is, negatively,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   how does thanklessness help us understand what sin is?
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280]   And positively, how does thanksgiving
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.040]   shape the trajectory of our lives?
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.080]   - This really is an astonishing text.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.460]   I thought all over again, I mean, I spent a lot of time
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.460]   just soaking in the amazing statements of this text,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.920]   especially because of its claim
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   that every human being knows God.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.320]   They know his eternity, they know his power,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.320]   they know his being creator of all, they know his deity.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440]   Everyone knows God.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.880]   Atheists know God.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.640]   Agnostics know God.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.040]   Animists know God.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.360]   Every person you meet on the street knows God.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.640]   And apart from God's saving grace, it says,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   every human being suppresses that knowledge.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.740]   And the reason we do is that every human being
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.260]   finds other things preferable to God,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.260]   which is the very essence of evil, the essence of sin.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.700]   "My people have committed two evils," Jeremiah says.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.040]   and dug out cisterns for themselves,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.740]   broken cisterns that can hold no water," Jeremiah 2:13.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.740]   This is the arch evil, the primal sin,
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.440]   the root of all other evils.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.180]   Humans find things, people,
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.040]   the creation preferable to God,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.120]   even though those other things are like dirt by comparison.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.400]   We don't prefer God.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.320]   We don't find God attractive.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.960]   We don't find God desirable, beautiful, satisfying.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.320]   That's the evil of all evils.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.040]   And that's why Paul says we suppress
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.680]   the knowledge of God that we have,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.320]   because that knowledge shows him
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.620]   as preferable to all things.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.680]   So we claim not to know God.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.920]   We claim not to know him, but we do know him.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.160]   We get angry at him for not making himself more plain.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   But Paul says God made himself perfectly plain to everyone.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.520]   Our problem is not lack of revelation.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.600]   Our problem is that we don't want to see.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.120]   We don't want to see.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   And so we suppress and pretend that we don't see.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.440]   So Paul says that's our darkness.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.040]   That's our foolishness.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.520]   That's the futility of our minds.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.080]   We find God unattractive, distasteful,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.800]   offensive, even abhorrent.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.000]   And then in all kinds of ways,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.260]   we exchange his infinitely beautiful,
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.160]   all satisfying glory for pitiful substitutes,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.880]   like images of ourselves,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.760]   cultural artifacts that exalt our ingenuity
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   and intelligence and creativity and vaunted independence,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.680]   with the result that humankind is under
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   the just wrath of God so that he hands us over
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   to more and more and greater and greater degradation,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.680]   which we see happening all around us.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.640]   And in the middle of this dreadful description
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.120]   of our human condition,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.320]   Paul mentions the positive alternative
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.400]   to that darkness and foolishness and futility
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.480]   and suppression of the truth,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   namely glorifying and thanking God,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.200]   precisely as God.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.760]   That's what's missing, glorifying and thanking God.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.560]   And that would change everything.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.040]   So let me read the text so that people can hear
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.000]   for themselves everything I just said.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.920]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.560]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.160]   who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.440]   So I'm just reading the text now.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.200]   For what can be known about God is plain to them
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.880]   because God has shown it to them, made it plain.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.840]   For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.960]   and divine nature have been clearly perceived
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.800]   since the creation of the world
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.080]   in the things that have been made.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.000]   He's a maker and they know it, we know it.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So they are without excuse for although they knew God,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.960]   that's probably the most amazing statement in the text.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.600]   Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.680]   or give thanks to him.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.840]   But they became futile in their thinking
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.440]   and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.920]   Claiming to be wise, they became fools
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.080]   and exchanged the glory of the immortal God
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.560]   for images resembling mortal man
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.400]   and birds and animals and creeping things.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.480]   So James is right.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.680]   James is asking about the place
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.520]   and the function of thankfulness in this text.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.560]   For although they knew God,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.800]   they did not glorify him as God or give thanks to him.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.840]   And I think when Paul mentioned both glorify
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   and give thanks, he knew that they were overlapping realities.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:23.200]   When we thank God, we are showing him to be glorious
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.160]   and no one can truly glorify God
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.560]   with a heart of ingratitude.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.600]   So they are overlapping realities,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.440]   but they're not the same, are they?
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   There are ways to feel and think and act that glorify God,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.200]   but we wouldn't call them thankfulness.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   So the reality of glorifying God is wider, it's bigger.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.440]   It's a bigger reality than thanking God.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   Thanking God is a subset, subspecies of glorifying God.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.600]   And yet Paul, of all the ways he could have mentioned
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.640]   that glorify God, he chooses to mention thankfulness
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.720]   alongside glorifying God.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.000]   Now, why is that?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.280]   First, I think it relates to the fact
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   that Paul has just said that what can be known about God
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.080]   is known through the things he has made.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.840]   In other words, everywhere a human being looks,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.840]   the sky, the forest, the mountains, the rivers, the sea,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.040]   the land, family, the mirror, all of it,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.640]   everywhere you look is made by God
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   and is a gift of God, the maker to humanity.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   Every single thing that gives us any pleasure at all
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.320]   in this world is a gift of God.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.680]   And the heart response that God created for glorifying him
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.960]   for his gifts is thankfulness.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.920]   That's what he created.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.240]   That's what he designed in the human heart
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.240]   as a response to this vast, vast array of made things,
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.840]   gifts.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   It's not wrong to speak of being thankful to God for God.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.760]   That's not wrong, but mostly in the Bible,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.520]   thankfulness relates to God's gifts
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.200]   and his deeds to bless us.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   For sure, God himself is the gift.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   And if we don't arrive there, we haven't arrived,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   but it is right and good that our hearts brim,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.400]   they just brim with thankfulness that God is a maker.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:05.840]   Everything that is not God was made by God.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.120]   Therefore, at every turn, everywhere we look,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.080]   all the time, 24/7, we should feel profoundly,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   continually, earnestly thankful for God's gifts.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.680]   I think that's one of the reasons why he listed thankfulness
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.240]   as the counterpart to glorify in this text.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   Secondly, I think Paul called out being thankful to God
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.280]   alongside glorifying God,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   because there is built into thankfulness,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.840]   humility, a sense of dependence,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.200]   and gladness in needy receiving.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   So humility, dependence, glad neediness,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.960]   which not surprisingly sounds a lot like faith.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.880]   I think if you pressed Paul,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   he would say true thankfulness toward our all glorious,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.920]   all powerful, all providing creator
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   includes humble, dependent, glad trust.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.280]   They may not be the same thing,
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.880]   but they are so intimately and integrally connected
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   that Paul thinks thankfulness is a good thing
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.320]   to mention here when he also wants to call attention
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.360]   to trust.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.520]   Can anyone truly say,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.040]   I am joyfully thankful to God
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.720]   for his all satisfying beauty and his all governing power
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.240]   and his all providing goodness to me,
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.400]   but I don't trust him.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.120]   Nobody can talk like that.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.720]   It's something's inauthentic
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.760]   if that kind of sentence is spoken.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.840]   Thankfulness when oriented on God
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.920]   is a deep and powerful experience.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   And so Paul describes its absence like this.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.200]   When thankfulness failed, quote,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.800]   they became futile in their thinking,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.620]   their foolish hearts were darkened,
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.740]   their claim to be wise was shown to be foolishness,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.300]   and they fell into the sacrilege of exchanging God
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.480]   for images, especially the one in the mirror.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.040]   That's the absence of thankfulness.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.840]   It's a horrible, horrible description.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.040]   So yes, I think James is right.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.800]   The absence of thankfulness
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.280]   as the absence of humility and dependence
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.120]   and glad neediness and trust
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.200]   is one way of describing the darkness and folly
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.220]   and futility of our own times.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.680]   It's the opposite, you could say,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   of pride, pride with a capital P.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.560]   The very pride that calls our shame glory,
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.920]   exactly the way Romans 1 describes it
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   when they exchange God for the person in the mirror,
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.140]   because the exchange of the opposite sex
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.140]   for the same sex in our passions is an outflow,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.440]   Paul says, of that very exchange of God
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.400]   for the person in the mirror.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.000]   So there are many ways to describe
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.280]   the desperate need of the world.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.680]   And one, according to Romans 1,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   is repentance from pride and independence
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.920]   and self-sufficiency toward a humble, dependent,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   happy, trustful neediness for God
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.320]   as he has revealed himself in Jesus,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.400]   which we call thankfulness.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.520]   - Wonderful, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.600]   It is right and good that our hearts brim with thankfulness,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.480]   that God is a maker.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.560]   Everything that is not God was made by God.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.640]   Therefore, at every turn, everywhere we look,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.960]   all the time, 24/7, we should feel profoundly,
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   continually, earnestly thankful for God's gifts, amen.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.280]   May the course of our lives be charted
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.560]   by our Godward thanksgiving.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.280]   Thanks for joining us on this Thanksgiving day,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.320]   or maybe the day after, a couple days after,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.840]   or whenever you catch up on the podcast.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.640]   In either case, we pray that your Thanksgiving
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.520]   is or was a wonderful day filled with Godward thanks.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.040]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   We'll see you Monday.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.560]   (Thanks for watching)
