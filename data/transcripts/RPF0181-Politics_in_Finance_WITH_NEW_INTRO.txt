[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.960]   Hey Radicals, this is Josh Rascheitz. The show you're about to listen to that you've just
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.520]   downloaded was kind of an interesting show, a different show. And the feedback from it,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.240]   a lot of people hated it and very violent in their feedback about how it was just a terrible show.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   So that's fine. I'm going to leave it here as an existent show for you. But I thought it might be
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   helpful at least. Maybe I wasn't clear when introducing it. Maybe I should have done it
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.640]   differently. If you want to hear me go back and forth on whatever, listen to episode 183 and
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.160]   you'll hear me kind of questioning. Maybe I don't know if I did it effectively or not. But
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.640]   just a quick intro for you. The number one question I'm trying to answer is I'm trying
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:02.960]   to demonstrate the long ranging impact of certain worldviews and certain long ranging goals and the
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.440]   impact on society. There are many things that are happening in modern life that are part of just a
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.320]   long term plan. And oftentimes, however, and a lot of them are related to finance, and I want to get
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.720]   into a lot of those financial issues. But the first question that you have to face with financial
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.480]   issues is how on earth do I actually figure out what's going on? The problem is most of the long
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.360]   range things have gone far beyond my lifetime, my own lifetime. And so it's hard for me to look at
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.600]   a financial issue and say, "Well, here's what's happened in 1931 and here's how that's played out
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   over the last almost 100 years." It's hard for me. There are a bunch of financial things that I
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.840]   could do. And it's hard to see because the financial stuff is boring, it's impenetrable,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.640]   you can never actually see it unless you look carefully for the clues. So I wanted to convey
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.480]   this thought to you. And as I thought about it, I thought, "Why don't I use social issues?" Because
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.120]   social issues are not generally based upon the analysis of a pie chart or the analysis of a
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   balance sheet of a country or the analysis of a trade deal. All that stuff has detailed numbers
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.000]   and most people put them to sleep. Social issues are things that we all have opinions on and that
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.280]   we all look at and say, "Ah, here, I know what's going on," or "Here's what I think should happen."
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.160]   Now, most of us, we all disagree with each other, but the point is social issues happen.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.560]   And you're going to hear me in this show talk about social issues. And I guess what was
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.320]   frustrating to me is I tried to present this in the most straightforward way possible, and still,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.640]   most people hated it. But I tried to do this fairly and as objectively as I could. So I read
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   an extensive amount from some specific documents. And my purpose in reading these documents was,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.320]   A, to fairly present the position, since I'm generally in opposition to much of the position,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.240]   trying to fairly present it, trying to present it to you in a way that didn't involve me just
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.000]   twisting it and pulling things out of context. And I said, "Well, I'll do this in a straightforward
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.320]   way." And then to just simply give you some information so that you can look in the day
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.800]   and time in which we live and see what's happening and see how it's happening. Because in decades to
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.200]   come, we've got a lot of work to do with specific financial things. Now, the almost universal
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.280]   feedback from this show is that it just didn't do its job and made more people angry than I
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.360]   guess that it helped. So I guess it was a failure from that perspective. But if you listen through
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.040]   those years, my hope is that you'll at least give it a shot and you'll learn something. Feel free to
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.200]   disagree with me. If you want to hear some more additional comment from me, listen to 183 after
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.360]   the show before you get mad and write me an email. But feel free to disagree with me. That's no big
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.440]   deal. I just want you to be aware of some information that for me was incredibly helpful.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.080]   And as you'll hear that develop in this show. The only other comment I make real quick is simply
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.880]   that this show I've marked it as explicit because A, it deals with very adult topics. It deals with
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.520]   very unpleasant topics that we don't generally like to talk about. These are not topics that
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   are mainstream in American society and American discourse. They're things that are distasteful
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   to most of us. And we don't quite know how to deal with them. We don't quite know how to deal with
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.120]   the history and we don't quite know how to deal with the future. We're all caught in this question
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.520]   of how do we integrate these things in these facts of life and what's right and what's wrong. And this
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.800]   is very emotionally charged. You'll also hear some words that are quite ugly. Just to be clear,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   because I thought it was clear, they're not my words. I'm just reading from specific documents
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   from a specific position point. So don't get mad at me about the words that are used. I decided
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.720]   that it was more important for me not to try to censor the documents that I'm reading from
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.320]   but rather just to present them without comment in a fair and objective way. So there's your warning.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.480]   Enjoy the show. I hope you gain from it. If you feel frustrated by it, fine. Feel free to skip it.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.160]   It doesn't matter. I mean, it does matter. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it mattered.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.560]   But there's the warning to it. So hopefully, you'll have a better listening experience than
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   the majority of the people who heard it when it first came out. Thanks so much for listening.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   Talk to you soon. Do you gain direct monetary and other value to your life from radical personal
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.320]   finance? Would you like to continue to be able to listen to the show without the interruption
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.960]   of advertisements? If so, I'd ask you to consider going to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.880]   and supporting the show directly. I've created a number of benefit packages to incentivize you

[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.440]   Today, let's talk about the intersection of politics, religion, philosophy, and finance.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.200]   And here's the case I'm going to make to you. We actually need more politics, religion, philosophy,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   and ethics in finance, not less. Give me a shot and let's see if you agree with me at the end
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:10.960]   of today's show. Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.920]   and I'm your host. Today, I bring you episode 181. And that's quite a provocative statement,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.800]   why we need more politics, religion, and philosophy in finance. It goes directly against
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.160]   some of the feedback that I hear on the show. But I'll bet if you give me some time today,
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.920]   I might be able to convince you of my point. I'll be interested to hear what you say.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:44.160]   I like to pay careful attention to the reviews that I get on the show. And I get some reviews
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.080]   publicly on the iTunes reviews. And thank you for those of you who leave those. I get some reviews
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.440]   in other places on the web. And thank you to those of you who leave reviews there. In fact,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.720]   if you haven't done that, please do that. That means a lot. It helps a lot. It's not the only
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.400]   thing that makes a difference in public rankings, but it is a big thing that makes a difference in
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.200]   public rankings, which is why you'll often hear podcasters request those reviews. And thank you
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   for those of you who do it. Some of you might want to wait until after hearing today's show,
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   so you can leave me a nasty review, which that's fine, too. But I like to read those reviews. And
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.680]   I also pay attention to a lot of the email feedback that I get from listeners, email feedback,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.320]   social media feedback, etc. And one of the themes that I sometimes hear is that, "Well, I like
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.400]   Joshua's stuff. I like his content, but he gets into politics a little bit too much." And this
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.040]   can be a real double-edged sword. If I were a beautiful, brilliant marketer, I would actually
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.000]   focus on always being political or always being specialized. And the reason for that is it
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.720]   allows a controversy is good for selling ideas and selling things. And then it brings around you
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.080]   the people who are kind of the true believers, so to speak. This is why you have such polarized
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.960]   opinions oftentimes in national media. People aren't looking for consensus or ways to work
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.800]   together. They're looking to be intentionally offensive. Because attention, all attention is
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.240]   good attention. That's often what you see in today's modern world. This is why you see
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.160]   many times celebrities will just be so off the wall, just so extreme with their personalities.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.200]   And instead of acting like a normal person, they just take on this extreme persona, well,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.960]   extreme selves in so many ways. Well, I actually don't do that myself, partly because I don't like
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.800]   controversy. I'm an introvert and I'm a peace lover. I really like to just get along with
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.280]   people and not, you know, I don't like to be offensive. I don't like to be difficult. I
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   personally am far happier just, you know, getting along with everyone going with the flow.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.800]   Unfortunately, or fortunately, whatever, I find myself in the position of sometimes taking stands
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.200]   against certain things that I believe are wrong. And I also believe that there comes a time in
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.760]   your life when you've got to take a stand for what's right. So much evil has happened throughout
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.000]   history when people haven't taken a stand for what's right. Sometimes that comes in as politics,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   sometimes that comes in as religion, sometimes that comes in as ethics. And I've just simply
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   made the commitment to myself that I wasn't going to stand aside and go with the flow.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.520]   I was going to just simply be me. And those of you who know me or who have ever had the chance to
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.240]   talk to me, I mean, any of you listen to the show at this point know who I am. I'm very clear. I'm
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.400]   the same person all the time, or at least I try to be. Maybe sometimes I make mistakes, but it's
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.760]   important to me to be a consistent person. So the question comes into when you bring in politics,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.320]   do I bring it in too much? So some of the reviews that I have gotten from time to time on iTunes
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.840]   say, you know, "I like Joshua, but he gets into politics too much," which is a fair review. A
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.960]   public forum like that is your opportunity as a listener to leave a review of any kind that you
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:02.800]   like. What surprises me, I haven't gotten the review of too much religion. And since I often
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.680]   talk about Christianity, I often talk about biblical principles, I often talk about those
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   types of things, that surprises me, because usually I would expect more negative feedback
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   on religion. We in our modern U.S. American culture are more okay with talking about politics
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.720]   than we are with talking about religion. But I'm sure those reviews will come, and that's fine.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.120]   But I haven't gotten many comments about that, but I got a lot of comments about politics.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.760]   And I've been wanting to do this show for a little while, and I have some questions that
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.040]   I'll actually be – one of them I'll be covering on tomorrow's show – that bring out the need for
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.920]   me to release this episode as a standalone episode. Because here's my conviction. You cannot
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:53.840]   disconnect politics, religion, or philosophy from your finances. It is not possible to do.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.640]   Simply not possible to do. And I'm going to make that case and I'm going to describe to you my
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.960]   reasons, but it's not possible to do. You might like to blunder along thinking that, "Well,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.520]   I can just talk about finance and not talk about politics and religion and philosophy," but
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.960]   it's not possible. Our lives are fully integrated in every way. It's not possible.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.600]   Let me give you a few examples. All of you who are listening to this show are in some way or
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:31.760]   another working. You're paying taxes. And your taxes are funding the state. Some of you, that's
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.960]   the United States of America. Some of you, that is the state of Germany or the state of England or
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.600]   Great Britain or the state of Australia. But you're working and you're paying taxes and your
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.360]   taxes are funding the state. And you have some type of relationship with the state. Perhaps you are
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.440]   poor and so you are a recipient of the state. Perhaps you are not poor and so you're a donor
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.760]   to the state. Well, what that actually means if you're a recipient of the state is you're not a
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.640]   recipient of the state. There's no such thing as a state. There's just your fellow citizens.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   And so what happens is a man with a badge and a gun comes and proverbially speaking,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.480]   sticks that gun in the ribs of a lot of your fellow citizens and says, "Give us your money."
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.920]   Then that man decides that the money is going to come to you. That's what tax is.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.760]   So it's either coming to you or coming from you, but that's how it works.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.600]   So you can't be disconnected with that system. You're either paying in or you're getting money
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.080]   out. And politics influence tax and many other aspects of life. I'm going to just go with tax
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.000]   for a moment and just show a couple of examples, but we'll talk about this and how this affects
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.360]   every area of life. In my state, the state of Florida, yesterday, Monday, April 20 was Tax
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:52.080]   Freedom Day. Nationally, it's April 24th, this Friday. April 24th is Tax Freedom Day.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.760]   What that means is that according to the Tax Foundation, which I will put a link to their
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.520]   article on this topic in the show notes, but according to the Tax Foundation on a national
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.200]   basis from January 1 to April 24 in the United States of America, you have been working for this
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:15.120]   first four months to pay your taxes. So after this Friday, for the rest of the year now,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   you can finally go ahead and put a little bit of money into your pocket. And you can go ahead and
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.240]   start to put a little bit of money into your own personal support, the food that you eat,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.520]   the clothing that your family needs, the housing to cover your head. And then perhaps you might be
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.560]   able to save a little bit of it. Now, I hope that you listening to the show that your Tax Freedom
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.200]   Day was much sooner than April 24. I hope that I've been able to teach you enough to be able to
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.040]   move that day up substantially. But on a national basis, that's the calculation.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.960]   So just think about that for a moment. Think back to the first of January
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.920]   and how much you've worked since then. Where were you on New Year's Day 2015?
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.080]   Or where were you whenever you're listening to this podcast? And think about the last four months
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:08.000]   of work, almost five months. The last months of work have been used purely to pay various taxes.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.600]   As a nation in the United States of America, we collectively pay more for taxes than we do on
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.240]   food, clothing, and housing combined. In some other nations where listeners are listening to
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:29.040]   the show, it's far higher. The US tax burden is, depending on your place in society, is actually
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:37.680]   relatively low on an international scale. Now, here's what's even worse. According to the Tax
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.960]   Foundation, if you include federal borrowing in the Tax Freedom Day number to represent future
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.400]   taxes owed that simply are being borrowed for, then instead of April 24 being your Tax Freedom
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.760]   Day, that goes out to May 8 of borrowing. Now, they at the Tax Foundation don't include these
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:02.240]   numbers, but I say if we included the cost of the unfunded liabilities of the federal social
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.520]   programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, my guess is that you would probably
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:13.680]   not be earning any money for yourself after Uncle Sam extracts his pound of flesh from your side.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.640]   Now, I don't know what the actual number is on that. That's just a guess. But when you compare
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:26.960]   the current $18.2 trillion of official debt outstanding with the over $200 trillion of
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:33.200]   unfunded costs of these programs, then you'll see the long-term problem. So politics matter.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:42.640]   They matter big time. So I can teach you individually how to avoid some of that tax
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.960]   burden. I can also teach you how to evade that tax burden. But we focus primarily on this show
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.320]   about avoiding the tax burden. But you also need to look at the core problem and say, "What is it
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.880]   in our society which allows this to happen?" Because you see, depending on your system of
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:05.920]   ethics or your system of philosophy or your system of religion or essentially your worldview,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.480]   you should or should not be doing anything that I teach you. Think about it. If you see paying
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.320]   tax as something that's a moral social good and you're avoiding paying extra tax when you could
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:26.640]   pay less, maybe you're compromising your system of ethics. Personally, I'm not compromising mine
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.480]   because I view the majority of taxation as theft. And so I'm minimizing the theft from my pocket
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.760]   and from your pocket. I'm sticking up for you and for me. But many people don't see taxation as
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.280]   theft. Now, I would need to qualify that statement. I'm not going to go into detail there because the
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.800]   discussion is what level of taxation is theft. Big conversation, not for today. But you should
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.760]   think through that for yourself and develop a worldview on that issue. I get personally,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.440]   I'm sure quite shocking to those of you who regularly listen to the show, but I get very
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.920]   frustrated when people try to say, "Well, I'm going to go ahead and increase taxes on everybody
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:13.840]   else, but I haven't voluntarily paid any extra for mine." I think that in the same way that the
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.560]   political campaigns are waged to say to a presidential nominee or whomever, "Release
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.920]   your tax returns." I think anytime anybody is making a statement of saying, "We should provide
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.840]   an additional level of taxation," then we should ask for that person to demonstrate their voluntary
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:34.720]   contributions to the US Treasury. But that goes back to my worldview and my system of ethics,
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.840]   and that's extremely unpopular. Now, what's interesting is let's just stick with the core
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.880]   aspects of the core CFP board five financial planning areas. And let's think about how a
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.120]   system of ethics and a system and a philosophy or a religion would play a role in each of these
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.360]   areas. What about insurance planning? With insurance planning, let's talk about life
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.040]   insurance. I've been doing this life insurance series. I maintain that you have a moral
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.600]   obligation to care for your family, and one effective way to do that is through the use of
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:18.880]   insurance products. That's my personal opinion at the moment. But what if your worldview doesn't
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.560]   place any particular emphasis on the role of the family? What if instead your worldview places an
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.800]   emphasis on the role of society and you say, "Well, it's not my responsibility to provide for
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.880]   my family. Rather, it's society's responsibility to provide for my family." Incidentally, this is
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:43.280]   exactly what the US American Society has decided. Although you're encouraged to buy life insurance,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:50.240]   theoretically, the Social Security Administration has a widows and orphans benefit where if you
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.880]   have attained a currently or fully insured status with the Social Security Administration
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:01.760]   and you die, your qualifying widows and qualifying orphans will receive money from the state.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.200]   That's money that all of your fellow citizens have chipped in and are continuing to pay in
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.920]   to provide and support your family. What about something like insurance, other aspects of
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.960]   insurance, health insurance? In the US, there was a major debate over the last few years about
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.160]   health insurance and about the role that health insurance has and it's deemed to be a societal
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:34.000]   need. The United Nations deems it a fundamental human right. Is that true? What about if we get
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:43.360]   into the aspects of investing? Are you investing in a way that is in line with your morality and
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:51.520]   your ethics and your general philosophy? I don't think I've mentioned this on the show but oddly,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.720]   I've hinted at it in months past when I was wrestling with the decision but I no longer,
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:03.120]   at this moment anyway, I no longer own any publicly traded securities. The reason that I no longer
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.840]   own any publicly traded securities is I decided that I cannot stand to have blood money in my
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:18.720]   account. Since the predominant way that in the past I have invested my money is through the use
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.960]   of mutual funds, I have no ability over that fund manager to choose and select their investments.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   I'm simply not willing to stand by anymore and profit from the evil that many of these
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:38.880]   corporations are perpetrating on the world. I don't necessarily expect you to agree with my
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.480]   statement but I got to the point where I simply could not own and I could not profit from the
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:50.960]   activities of some of these corporations. Many of the major corporations in the Fortune 500,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.160]   the largest corporations in the United States of America are involved in what I consider to be pure
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.000]   evil. Although for – let's see. So I'm almost 30 and I started investing in mutual funds at 18.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.280]   So for the past 12 years, that has not bothered me. At this point, it has come to bother me and
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:15.680]   I can no longer do it. So I'm now in the process of formulating a new personal investment plan for
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:24.560]   my funds and my family's funds that will permit that. That will permit – that will allow for
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.840]   the moral issues that I have with many of the large corporations and their actions.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.680]   What about you? How are you investing your money?
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.320]   What about tax? We covered tax. What about estate planning? That's another area,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.680]   a key area of planning for the CFP board's subject areas. The topic of estate planning,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.080]   who says that you have the right to leave your money behind to the person to whom you desire
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.120]   to leave it to. Why not have all assets that are remaining at the point of death confiscated?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   We do that to rich people. That's why we have estate taxes and I can share with you several
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.520]   books that would strongly advocate for an increasing level of federal estate taxes.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.280]   The idea is we've got to keep the money out of the hands of large families and we've got to move
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:19.360]   the money into the society in general. So that's the whole fundamental – and it's a moral argument,
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.040]   moral premise of why we need an egalitarian society.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:29.520]   Now, I would maintain that it's not somebody else's responsibility what
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.520]   happens with your money when you die. That's due to my worldview.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:42.080]   What's your view on that subject? You can't get away from having a view. You have a view.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.920]   Just the challenge is that most of us have not effectively articulated
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.280]   that viewpoint. You have to effectively articulate your viewpoint to understand what you believe.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.760]   I'll skip the other areas of the CFP board's topic areas and I meant to mention
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.720]   at the beginning of the show – I am 18 minutes in. This is going to be a long show
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.560]   and I fully expect that. But I'm going to deal with it in one individual episode that
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.480]   is comprehensive rather than breaking it apart. It's important that you get this as an overall
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.720]   theme. But this is going to be a long show. If you look at the philosophy that's behind each
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.360]   of these things, you have to then look at what are the actions. So for example, the reason we
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.000]   need more politics is you start studying politics and you find that – well, wait a second. This
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.040]   politician is on one side saying we need to use taxes to extract more wealth from the rich. But
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.600]   then you look and you realize that the fundamental tactic and tool used by the rich to control
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:51.200]   society is the use of a tax-exempt foundation and that all they need to do is make a 100%
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.720]   contribution to a tax-exempt foundation and they can continue to control the public discourse,
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.040]   continue to control policy from far beyond the grave. Yet now it's completely done out of the
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.200]   tax space. I'll teach you how to do that and I'll expose that. I'm just briefly covering it today.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.320]   You've got to see through and actually understand. Then you've got to take that and line it up with
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.960]   your worldview. Now, I'm a total amateur on all of these things. I'm an amateur on worldviews. I'm an
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:26.800]   amateur on philosophy. I'm just an interested student and there may be things that I say in
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.640]   today's show that are simply wrong. Feel free to come by and correct me. I'd be happy to learn.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.200]   But here's why – here's my philosophy that I have on the show, especially when questions are
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.960]   asked of me, which is usually where these topics come in. I believe never answer a question that
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.920]   isn't asked of you. I've found in my lifetime that it's foolish for me to spend any time answering
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.320]   people's questions if they're not asking them. Very few people ask me in common life about
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.560]   anything related to financial planning. It might be surprising, but how many of you ask people that
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.360]   are knowledgeable in your life specific questions? Very few people ask me and I never answer
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.800]   financial planning questions unless I'm asked. But when I'm asked a question, I believe always
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:16.080]   answer the actual question that's asked of you and answer it in a clear and direct manner. I think we
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.160]   should always answer the questions that are asked of us and we should actually focus on what is
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:27.280]   most effective. We should point out when people are asking an unfocused question, are asking a
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.680]   question that won't actually solve their problem. An example would be this. "Joshua, what should I
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:38.080]   invest my 401(k) in?" That's usually a bad question because if I answered it directly and just said,
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.400]   "Well, you should invest your 401(k) in a broadly built portfolio of publicly traded companies.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.240]   Here are some mutual funds. Let me talk to you about expense ratios," I'm probably shortchanging
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.800]   the person. So that's why we back up to the fundamental question of why do you have a 401(k).
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.040]   What are your long-term financial goals? Where are you today? What are your overall best
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:02.160]   investment opportunities? What is your overall plan to wealth? So I don't answer the question
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.520]   of what should I invest my 401(k) in because the times that I have answered the question,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.840]   and I'll probably do it again against my own better judgment, then often the person blindly
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   does what I say and they never actually achieve their goal. They just have a little bit of money
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.280]   in their 401(k) and it may or may not be invested in an ideal manner, but it never achieves the
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.600]   goal of retirement and that's where most people are in our society. They're completely flat broke
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.280]   at 65 with maybe $30,000 piled up in a 401(k) that was intelligently invested, but they never sat
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.800]   down and actually built a retirement plan. So many of you who are listening in this audience
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.560]   enjoy it when I clarify that on specific financial topics, but many people get upset at me when
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.400]   the topics go into politics or religion, but it's the same philosophy that I have in every area of
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.480]   life. Ask the question that's actually being asked and focus on the solution that actually
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.400]   makes the difference. So, example, when I talk about college, it's not the idea that college is
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.640]   bad. The problem is the idea that college is simply not a magic ticket to the good life of
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:09.120]   your student. So the core idea that leads to wealth and worldly success is having a deep love
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.400]   of education and frankly learning to be an autodidact, a self-learner. So we can cultivate
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.560]   that with college or without. So let's stop focusing on all the nonsense about the college
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   argument that happens in our debate and focus on education. Well, wait a second. If you focus
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.960]   on education, then you got to back up and say, "Well, why do so many people who are going to
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.040]   college not actually care about education?" So then you got to break apart the schooling system
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.120]   as I've done on the show and all of a sudden you find out that the purpose of school has never been
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.320]   about education but about societal control and about indoctrination. Huh. Well, now we can
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.800]   actually focus on something that's a little bit more effective and we can stop wasting time and
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:55.120]   years of focus and effort on schooling and we can focus on education. It's a radically different
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:06.160]   approach, but it's also more effective. So today I want to talk to you about worldview.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   I want to ask you, what is your worldview?
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:16.400]   Now, this is not something that most people in modern US American society are accustomed to
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:23.440]   discussing. It's possible – I come from a biblical Christian worldview. That's the worldview
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   that I've built for myself. But it's possible that maybe if you come from a religious background
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   or from a Christian background, you might be slightly more accustomed to discussing it than
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.480]   some other people simply because you're used to being on the fringe of society. So that's my
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.960]   experience. I'm comfortable being on the fringe of society. I'm comfortable with debate because
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.120]   most of the opinions and the viewpoints that I hold are in the vast minority of mainstream society.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.160]   So I'm comfortable with it. So I always discuss worldview, but many people are not comfortable
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.760]   and they haven't searched out a worldview. Now, what is a worldview? Here's the Wikipedia
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.920]   definition. "A comprehensive worldview is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.600]   or society encompassing the entirety of the individual or society's knowledge and point of
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:16.240]   view. A worldview can include natural philosophy, fundamental, existential, and normative postulates
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:22.880]   or themes, values, emotions, and ethics." Basically, a worldview is how do you see the world?
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.400]   What are the lenses that are on your face that when you look at a bit of data and look at a
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.720]   little bit of information, how do you see that? All worldviews are in the process of being developed,
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:40.960]   changed, modified, adapted. I'm constantly in the process of clarifying my own worldview,
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.360]   testing assumptions, throwing out things that are wrong.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   There have been massive changes in my life over the past decade. Again, I'm almost 30.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.040]   I wasn't born again as a Christian until I was in my junior year of college. That was when I was 20.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:05.440]   So I basically had 10 years to try to build a consistent worldview that's based on biblical
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:13.040]   truth. That's not an easy process. It requires you going through and looking at various beliefs
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:20.240]   that you have and testing them. It's certainly not over. It's just, I'm just getting started.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.880]   But the process of going through and building and developing a worldview is incredibly important.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:33.200]   You have to do it for yourself. Now, I'm actually not going to talk much today about
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.400]   a biblical Christian worldview. That is the worldview that I hold to and maintain,
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.200]   and there are many reasons for some of which I've covered in the past shows, but it's the only one
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.520]   that I've found to be intellectually defensible. So you'll consistently hear me reference it
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.920]   throughout the course of the show. But I'm not actually going to talk about it today,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.480]   because that's what I talk about a lot of the other times. But I am going to give you a foil
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:04.160]   for it, what I often think about, that in my mind I can continually go back and forth and I compare
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.360]   a biblical Christian worldview with a secular humanist worldview.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:16.480]   So that's usually the comparison that you'll hear me describe. And most of you listening,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.800]   my guess, is most of you hold to a worldview of secular humanism.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.760]   Now, you may or may not have adopted this consciously, so I'm going to talk about it.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.320]   Because once you understand the differences between these two worldviews, and there are
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.800]   many other worldviews, this is just for me, these are the two worldviews that I'm most familiar with,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.960]   because we have the predominant worldview in the US American culture of secular humanism,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.560]   and then my own worldview of biblical Christianity, and I'm not familiar with every single aspect. I
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:52.960]   don't know how a Hindu, someone coming from a Hindu worldview, would say, "Well, my religion
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.640]   applies to the situation. I'm not an expert on that. It is not a major factor in my life around
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:04.000]   me. I'm not surrounded by Hindus. If I were, I would spend a lot more time focusing on understanding
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.120]   what the worldview is from that perspective." I don't think about Sufism. I don't know any people
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.440]   who practice the Sufi religion, so I just don't think about it much. But I do think about secular
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:22.800]   humanism and biblical Christianity. So, I'll share with you a little bit, because if you
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.120]   understand the worldview of secular humanism, it will start to make sense. You'll start to
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.440]   understand a lot more of the things that are happening in the world around us and in our
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:41.120]   society and culture at large. Let's start with the definition. According to Wikipedia,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:48.560]   "The philosophy of secular humanism embraces human reason, ethics, and philosophical naturalism
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:54.240]   while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, and superstition as the basis
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.640]   of morality and decision-making. Secular humanism posits that human beings are capable of being
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:09.120]   ethical and moral without religion or a god." One of the leading humanist organizations is
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.840]   called the American Humanist Association, and their motto is "Good without a God."
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.680]   Now, I'm going to read you the Humanist Manifesto from 1973. The first humanist manifesto that they
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.080]   published was actually in 1933, which is interesting, because if you trace the development
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:30.400]   of the secular humanist worldview, you find that it was substantially slowed by World War II.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:38.000]   So, they published their first manifesto in 1933, the second manifesto in 1973, and then a third one
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.600]   in 2003. The uniqueness of those dates is that there's 40 years in between.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:49.120]   Now, the third one is actually the shortest, but I'm going to read you the second one,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.080]   because once you understand what the Humanist Manifesto of 1973 says, then you'll be able to
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.120]   look at society at large, and you'll be able to look at the culture around you, and you'll be
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.760]   able to look at your daily newspaper or daily yahoo.com, wherever you intake your news, and
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.920]   you'll be able to understand what's happening in society around.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.320]   And I also want you to think about applying this as a system of ethics to financial questions,
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.760]   because this is the background of the system of ethics that is, for the most part, being applied
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:25.840]   to financial topics. I'll read this to you in its entirety. I may or may not comment. It's going to
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.920]   take a little bit of time, but just think about this. And again, if you agree with this worldview,
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.360]   great. Hopefully, you've read this before. If you have this worldview, hopefully, you've read it.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.560]   It's about as sad as, I mean, it's like, if you haven't read this, but you hold to a secular
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.640]   humanist worldview, that's about as sad as many Christians who, it's also sad, and it's very true,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.160]   many Christians who say, "I'm a Christian and never bothered to open a Bible and see what the
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:53.040]   Bible actually says about what is Christianity." On all worldviews, there are bastardizations of
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.200]   the worldview and various interpretations, and some of them are worth arguing about, and some
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.120]   of them are just plain ignorant. But if you don't agree with this worldview, then let me ask you
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:08.000]   why not. So I'll share this with you. Now, again, as I read this, I want you to hold three things
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.120]   in your mind. Number one, I'm reading you the Manifesto from 1973, not the one from 2003,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.680]   which is shorter. And the reason is I want you to see what has changed from 1973 until 2015 when
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:26.720]   this is being recorded. Number two, pay attention to the general themes of this, and then think
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.040]   about the general themes of the stories and the news and the articles and all of the debate
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:37.920]   happening in the world. And number three, pay attention to its impact on finance, especially
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:47.200]   on personal finance. So here we go. First, in the best sense, there's a little bit of preamble,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:54.720]   but this launches right into the actual text that is outlining the ideas. The best sense
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.960]   outlining the ideas. First, in the best sense, religion may inspire dedication to the highest
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:06.480]   ethical ideals. The cultivation of moral devotion and creative imagination is an expression of
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:13.920]   genuine spiritual experience and aspiration. We believe, however, that traditional dogmatic or
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:21.040]   authoritarian religions that place revelation, God, ritual, or creed above human needs and experience
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.320]   do a disservice to the human species. Any account of nature should pass the tests of
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.120]   scientific evidence in our judgment. The dogmas and myths of traditional religions do not do so.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   Even at this late date in human history, certain elementary facts based upon the critical use of
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.280]   scientific reason have to be restated. We find insufficient evidence for belief in the existence
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.320]   of a supernatural. It is either meaningless or irrelevant to the question of survival and
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:59.840]   fulfillment of the human race. As non-theists, we begin with humans, not God. Nature, not deity.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:06.480]   Nature may indeed be broader and deeper than we now know. Any new discoveries, however,
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:12.800]   will but enlarge our knowledge of the natural. Some humanists believe we should reinterpret
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.440]   traditional religions and reinvest them with meanings appropriate to the current situation.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.880]   Such redefinitions, however, often perpetuate old dependencies and escapisms. They easily become
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.360]   obscurantist, impeding the free use of the intellect. We need, instead, radically new
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.880]   human purposes and goals. We appreciate the need to preserve the best ethical teachings in the
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:42.960]   religious traditions of humankind, many of which we share in common. But we reject those features
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.920]   of traditional religious morality that deny humans a full appreciation of their own potentialities
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.160]   and responsibilities. Traditional religions often offer solace to humans, but as often,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.960]   they inhibit humans from helping themselves or experiencing their full potentialities.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.800]   Such institutions, creeds, and rituals often impede the will to serve others.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Too often, traditional faiths encourage dependence rather than independence,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:17.840]   obedience rather than affirmation, fear rather than courage. More recently, they have generated
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:23.840]   concerned social action, with many signs of relevance appearing in the wake of the "God
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:29.440]   is Dead" theologies. But we can discover no divine purpose or providence for the human species.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:36.080]   While there is much that we do not know, humans are responsible for what we are or will become.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.120]   No deity will save us. We must save ourselves.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.400]   Second, promises of immortal salvation or fear of eternal damnation are both illusory
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.560]   and harmful. They distract humans from present concerns, from self-actualization, and from
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:02.000]   rectifying social injustices. Modern science discredits such historic concepts as the "ghost
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.120]   in the machine" and the "separable soul." Rather, science affirms that the human species is an
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   emergence from natural evolutionary forces. As far as we know, the total personality is a
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   function of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context. There is no
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.640]   credible evidence that life survives the death of the body. We continue to exist in our progeny
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.840]   and in the way that our lives have influenced others in our culture.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.360]   Traditional religions are surely not the only obstacles to human progress.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.000]   Other ideologies also impede human advance. Some forms of political doctrine, for instance,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.440]   function religiously, reflecting the worst features of orthodoxy and authoritarianism,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.520]   especially when they sacrifice individuals on the altar of utopian promises.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.800]   Purely economic and political viewpoints, whether capitalist or communist,
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:05.280]   often function as religious and ideological dogma. Although humans undoubtedly need economic
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.520]   and political goals, they also need creative values by which to live.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:15.760]   Ethics Third, we affirm that moral values derive
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:24.640]   their source from human experience. Ethics is autonomous and situational, needing no theological
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:32.320]   or ideological sanction. Ethics stem from human need and interest. To deny this distorts the whole
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:40.480]   basis of life. Human life has meaning because we create and develop our futures. Happiness and the
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:47.280]   creative realization of human needs and desires, individually and in shared enjoyment, are
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:55.600]   continuous themes of humanism. We strive for the good life, here and now. The goal is to pursue
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:02.560]   life's enrichment despite debasing forces of vulgarization, commercialization, and dehumanization.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:10.160]   Fourth, reason and intelligence are the most effective instruments that humankind possesses.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:18.640]   There is no substitute. Neither faith nor passion suffices in itself. The controlled use of
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   scientific methods, which have transformed the natural and social sciences since the Renaissance,
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:31.200]   must be extended further in the solution of human problems. But reason must be tempered by humility,
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:38.240]   since no group has a monopoly of wisdom or virtue. Nor is there any guarantee that all problems can
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:46.400]   be solved or all questions answered. Yet critical intelligence, infused by a sense of human caring,
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.320]   is the best method that humanity has for resolving problems. Reason should be balanced
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:59.200]   with compassion and empathy, and the whole person fulfilled. Thus, we are not advocating the use of
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   scientific intelligence independent of or in opposition to emotion, for we believe in the
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:13.120]   cultivation of feeling and love. As science pushes back the boundary of the known, humankind's sense
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:20.400]   of wonder is continually renewed, and art, poetry, and music find their places along with religion
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:28.560]   and ethics. The Individual Fifth, the preciousness and dignity of the individual person is a central
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.720]   humanist value. Individuals should be encouraged to realize their own creative talents and desires.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:42.000]   We reject all religious, ideological, or moral codes that denigrate the individual,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.360]   suppress freedom, dull intellect, dehumanize personality. We believe in maximum individual
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:55.680]   autonomy, consonant with social responsibility. Although science can account for the causes of
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.920]   behavior, the possibilities of individual freedom of choice exist in human life and should be
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:10.880]   increased. Sixth, in the area of sexuality, we believe that intolerant attitudes, often cultivated
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:19.120]   by orthodox religions and puritanical cultures, unduly repress sexual conduct. The right to birth
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:25.520]   control, abortion, and divorce should be recognized. While we do not approve of exploitive,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:32.880]   denigrating forms of sexual expression, neither do we wish to prohibit by law or social sanction
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:39.280]   sexual behavior between consenting adults. The many varieties of sexual exploration should not
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.720]   in themselves be considered evil. Without countenancing mindless permissiveness or
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:51.360]   unbridled promiscuity, a civilized society should be a tolerant one. Short of harming others or
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.960]   compelling them to do likewise, individuals should be permitted to express their sexual proclivities
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.920]   and pursue their lifestyles as they desire. We wish to cultivate the development of a
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:07.840]   responsible attitude toward sexuality, in which humans are not exploited as sexual objects,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:15.200]   and in which intimacy, sensitivity, respect, and honesty in interpersonal relations are encouraged.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.440]   Moral education for children and adults is an important way of developing awareness and
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.040]   sexual maturity. Democratic Society
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.480]   Seventh, to enhance freedom and dignity, the individual must experience a full range of
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   civil liberties in all societies. This includes freedom of speech and the press, political
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.880]   democracy, the legal right of opposition to governmental policies, fair judicial process,
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:49.520]   religious liberty, freedom of association, and artistic, scientific, and cultural freedom.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:56.960]   It also includes a recognition of an individual's right to die with dignity, euthanasia,
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   and the right to suicide. We oppose the increasing invasion of privacy by whatever means
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:10.000]   in both totalitarian and democratic societies. We would safeguard, extend, and implement the
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.640]   principles of human freedom evolved from the Magna Carta to the Bill of Rights, the Rights of Man,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:24.160]   and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eighth, we are committed to an open and democratic
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:30.960]   society. We must extend participatory democracy in its true sense to the economy, the school,
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:36.640]   the family, the workplace, and voluntary associations. Decision-making must be
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:43.280]   decentralized to include widespread involvement of people at all levels, social, political,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.800]   and economic. All persons should have a voice in developing the values and goals that determine
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:55.520]   their lives. Institutions should be responsive to express desires and needs. The conditions of work,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:03.680]   education, devotion, and play should be humanized. Alienating forces should be modified or eradicated,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:09.920]   and bureaucratic structures should be held to a minimum. People are more important than decalogues,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:18.080]   rules, proscriptions, or regulations. Ninth, the separation of church and state and the separation
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:24.400]   of ideology and state are imperatives. The state should encourage maximum freedom for different
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:30.720]   moral, political, religious, and social values in society. It should not favor any particular
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:37.040]   religious bodies through the use of public monies, nor espouse a single ideology and function thereby
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:43.840]   as an instrument of propaganda or oppression, particularly against dissenters. Tenth,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:51.280]   humane societies should evaluate economic systems not by rhetoric or ideology, but by whether or not
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.800]   they increase economic well-being for all individuals and groups, minimize poverty and
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:03.920]   hardship, increase the sum of human satisfaction, and enhance the quality of life. Hence, the door
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:10.240]   is open to alternative economic systems. We need to democratize the economy and judge it by its
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:17.600]   responsiveness to human needs, testing results in terms of the common good. Eleventh, the principle
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.880]   of moral equality must be furthered through elimination of all discrimination based upon race,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:30.800]   religion, sex, age, or national origin. This means equality of opportunity and recognition of talent
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.440]   and merit. Individuals should be encouraged to contribute to their own betterment.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:41.120]   If unable, then society should provide means to satisfy their basic economic, health, and cultural
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:48.560]   needs, including, wherever resources make possible, a minimum guaranteed annual income. We are concerned
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:54.720]   for the welfare of the aged, the infirm, the disadvantaged, and also for the outcasts,
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.520]   the mentally retarded, abandoned, or abused children, the handicapped, prisoners, and addicts,
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:08.000]   for all who are neglected or ignored by society. Practicing humanists should make it their vocation
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:15.760]   to humanize personal relations. We believe in the right to universal education. Everyone has a right
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:23.200]   to the cultural opportunity to fulfill his or her unique capacities and talents. The schools
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   should foster satisfying and productive living. They should be open at all levels to any and all.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.720]   The achievement of excellence should be encouraged. Innovative and experimental forms of education are
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:41.040]   to be welcomed. The energy and idealism of the young deserve to be appreciated and channeled
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:48.240]   to constructive purposes. We deplore racial, religious, ethnic, or class antagonisms.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   Although we believe in cultural diversity and encourage racial and ethnic pride, we reject
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:00.640]   separations which promote alienation and set people and groups against each other. We envision an
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:06.080]   integrated community where people have a maximum opportunity for free and voluntary association.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.680]   We are critical of sexism or sexual chauvinism, male or female. We believe in equal rights for
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.960]   both women and men to fulfill their unique careers and potentialities as they see fit,
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.360]   free of invidious discrimination. World Community.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:30.640]   Twelfth, we deplore the division of humankind on nationalistic grounds. We have reached a
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.680]   turning point in human history where the best option is to transcend the limits of national
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.120]   sovereignty and to move toward the building of a world community in which all sectors of the
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:47.440]   human family can participate. Thus, we look to the development of a system of world law and a world
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:53.440]   order based upon transnational federal government. This would appreciate cultural pluralism and
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.280]   diversity. It would not exclude pride in national origins and accomplishments, nor the handling of
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.400]   regional problems on a regional basis. Human progress, however, can no longer be achieved
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.880]   by focusing on one section of the world, western or eastern, developed or undeveloped. For the
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:16.640]   first time in human history, no part of humankind can be isolated from any other. Each person's
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   future is in some way linked to all. We thus reaffirm a commitment to the building of world
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.840]   community, at the same time recognizing that this commits us to some hard choices.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:35.040]   Thirteenth, the world community must renounce the resort to violence and force as a method of
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.240]   solving international disputes. We believe in the peaceful adjudication of differences by
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:45.440]   international courts and by the development of the arts of negotiation and compromise.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:52.480]   War is obsolete. So is the use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. It is a
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:58.080]   planetary imperative to reduce the level of military expenditures and turn these savings
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:04.720]   to peaceful and people-oriented uses. Fourteenth, the world community must engage
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:10.880]   in cooperative planning concerning the use of rapidly depleting resources. The planet Earth
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:17.440]   must be considered a single ecosystem. Ecological damage, resource depletion, and "excessive
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:24.400]   population growth" must be checked by international concord. The cultivation and conservation of
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.600]   nature is a moral value. We should perceive ourselves as integral to the sources of our
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:35.600]   being in nature. We must free our world from needless pollution and waste, responsibly
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:42.240]   guarding and creating wealth, both natural and human. Exploitation of natural resources,
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:49.200]   uncurbed by social conscience, must end. Fifteenth, the problems of economic growth
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:54.640]   and development can no longer be resolved by one nation alone. They are worldwide in scope.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:00.000]   It is the moral obligation of the developed nations to provide, through an international
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.800]   authority that safeguards human rights, massive technical, agricultural, medical, and economic
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:12.320]   assistance, including birth control techniques, to the developing portions of the world—excuse
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:19.280]   me, developing portions of the globe. World poverty must cease. Hence, extreme disproportions
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   in wealth, income, and economic growth should be reduced on a worldwide basis.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   Sixteenth, technology is a vital key to human progress and development. We deplore any
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:38.640]   neo-romantic efforts to condemn indiscriminately all technology and science, or to counsel retreat
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:44.560]   from its further extension and use for the good of humankind. We would resist any moves to censor
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:51.360]   basic scientific research on moral, political, or social grounds. Technology must, however,
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:57.280]   be carefully judged by the consequences of its use. Harmful and destructive changes should be
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:04.000]   avoided. We are particularly disturbed when technology and bureaucracy control, manipulate,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.480]   or modify human beings without their consent. Technological feasibility does not imply social
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:18.320]   or cultural desirability. Seventeenth, we must expand communication and transportation across
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:25.360]   frontiers. Travel restrictions must cease. The world must be open to diverse political,
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:31.200]   ideological, and moral viewpoints, and evolve a worldwide system of television and radio for
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:37.440]   information and education. We thus call for full international cooperation in culture,
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:44.000]   science, the arts, and technology across ideological borders. We must learn to live
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:52.560]   openly together, or we shall perish together. Humanity as a whole. In closing, the world
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.680]   cannot wait for a reconciliation of competing political or economic systems to solve its
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:03.040]   problems. These are the times for men and women of goodwill to further the building of a peaceful
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:08.960]   and prosperous world. We urge that parochial loyalties and inflexible moral and religious
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:16.560]   ideologies be transcended. We urge recognition of the common humanity of all people. We further
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:23.440]   urge the use of reason and compassion to produce the kind of world we want, a world in which peace,
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:29.760]   prosperity, freedom, and happiness are widely shared. Let us not abandon that vision in despair
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:36.960]   or cowardice. We are responsible for what we are or will be. Let us work together for a humane
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:42.480]   world by means commensurate with humane ends. Destructive ideological differences among
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:48.720]   communism, capitalism, socialism, conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism should be overcome.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:55.520]   Let us call for an end to terror and hatred. We will survive and prosper only in a world of
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:01.040]   shared humane values. We can initiate new directions for humankind. Ancient rivalries
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.920]   can be superseded by broad-based cooperative efforts. The commitment to tolerance,
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:11.840]   understanding, and peaceful negotiation does not necessitate acquiescence to the status quo,
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:18.000]   nor the damning up of dynamic and revolutionary forces. The true revolution is occurring and can
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.080]   continue in countless nonviolent adjustments. But this entails the willingness to step forward onto
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:29.520]   new and expanding plateaus. At the present juncture of history, commitment to all humankind
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:35.200]   is the highest commitment of which we are capable. It transcends the narrow allegiances of church,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:41.360]   state, party, class, or race in moving toward a wider vision of human potentiality.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:49.280]   What more daring a goal for humankind than for each person to become, in ideal as well as practice,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:55.680]   a citizen of a world community? It is a classical vision. We can now give it new vitality.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:03.040]   Humanism, thus interpreted, is a moral force that has time on its side. We believe that humankind
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:10.080]   has the potential, intelligence, goodwill, and cooperative skill to implement this commitment
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:17.840]   in the decades ahead. Again, that's Humanist Manifesto Number Two, published in 1973.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:25.840]   Now, I read you the second—that document instead of the Humanist Manifesto Number Three
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.840]   for a couple of reasons. Feel free to go and read Humanist Manifesto Number Three. That one was
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:37.280]   six pages. The Humanist Manifesto Number Three is just over one page, much smaller and shorter.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:43.680]   But this philosophy has developed and emerged over time with changes. But it's important that
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:50.240]   you understand that was what was set out in 1973. Now, think back—and I'll post a link in the show
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.960]   notes so you can read it—but think back or take time when you're in front of a computer and you
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.760]   can look through and look at each of the issues that are promoted in that document.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:05.840]   Many of the ideas and ideals set forth in that document have been achieved.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:14.320]   Many. Not all. All of them are in progress, but many of them have been achieved. The growth of
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:20.240]   the international community, the establishment of an international court, the—I won't go
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:24.400]   through them. You go through them and do a little bit of homework. So if that's your worldview,
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.680]   you should be happy and proud of that to be read. If that's not your worldview,
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:35.760]   why is it not your worldview? Now, why do I go into worldview to such an extent?
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:41.120]   Well, it's impossible to be neutral on your worldview. There is no neutrality at all.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:48.640]   It is not possible for that worldview to be consistent in any way, shape, or form by any
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.800]   person of, for example, Christian faith. I don't know about every religion. Perhaps some religions
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:59.040]   of the world could concede with that. But it is impossible for a Christian to go along with
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:06.960]   secular humanism as a viable worldview. And thus, we get into the current war of worldviews that
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:13.440]   exists in our culture. Now, interestingly, it exists at every aspect of culture. For example,
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:18.560]   the first humanist manifesto from 1933 didn't necessarily use the term "secular humanism,"
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.920]   but rather used the term in the manifesto of "religious humanism." But specifically in that
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:30.400]   document stated that, "We are convinced that the time has passed for theism, deism, modernism,
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.720]   and the several varieties of new thought." And many of the original signers of the manifesto
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:40.960]   from 1933 were involved with so-called churches. Primarily, they were liberal Unitarian churches.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:47.440]   But you can see then in the transition 40 years later to secular humanism.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.960]   Now, unfortunately, most people haven't consciously gone through, constructed, and adopted a worldview
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.840]   for themselves. Most of us have been indoctrinated by the government school system in our country of
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:03.280]   origin. In the United States, the takeover of the government school system is almost 100%
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.160]   complete and has been for many, many decades. The school system in the United States is almost
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.640]   entirely secular humanist in its approach. There's a famous, famous quote that's bandied
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   about in these debates. I'll cite it simply as an illustration of my point, but it's probably the
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.840]   most famous quote in these, quoted thousands of times in this war. It's from a 1983 essay by a
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:26.560]   humanist named John Dunphy. And this essay was titled "A Religion for a New Age." But one
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:32.640]   specific quote he wrote is this, "I am convinced that the battle for humankind's future must be
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:38.960]   waged and won in the public school classroom by teachers that correctly perceive their role
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.720]   as proselytizers of a new faith, a religion of humanity that recognizes and respects the spark
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:51.920]   of what theologians call divinity in every human being. The classroom must and will become an arena
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.600]   of conflict between the old and new, the rotting corpse of Christianity together with all its
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.440]   adjacent evils and misery, and the new faith of humanism, resplendent with the promise of a world
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.800]   in which the never real is the real. The new faith of humanity is the new faith of the
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:16.160]   realized Christian ideal of love thy neighbor will finally be achieved." That's just one
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.920]   illustrative quote that's incredibly famous that gives the background of the US government school
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.640]   system. And again, the war in that arena has been, in my opinion, convincingly won by the secular
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.960]   humanists. The problem is that in the post-school culture, the war is not won. The battle lines are
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.080]   still drawn because there are enough artifacts of a, in the United States, a biblical Christian
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:45.520]   worldview that you see the battle happening in modern culture. So unless you've consciously
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.840]   constructed a worldview for yourself, you're left with this confusing potpourri of opinions.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:55.200]   And these opinions touch every aspect of your life. Every story you see on the news
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:02.480]   is argued based on worldview. Every decision is based on worldview. And we're all engaged
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:10.720]   in the struggle for the supremacy of our own unique worldview. So how do you approach this
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:18.000]   and apply this to a system of ethics? Well, with the mindset of secular humanism, then your major
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.480]   guiding principles are twofold. Your personal happiness is one consideration. And then there's
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.880]   a more general concept of collective human rights and collective human dignity.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:38.160]   Now, you need to understand that these two things might or might not be at odds, and you have to
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:44.080]   pick, depending on your flavor of secular humanism, you have to pick which one is more important.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:50.800]   Let's talk about personal happiness for just a moment. You need to carefully understand the
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.920]   marked difference between worldviews and the concept of personal happiness. Within the secular
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:03.120]   humanist worldview, personal happiness is a primary motivator. In a biblical Christian worldview,
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.200]   happiness is not relevant. Christians, in fact, are promised a lifetime of suffering and persecution.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.920]   In fact, in our worldview, if you're not suffering persecution, you're probably out of line with what
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.160]   the Bible actually teaches. You see this throughout the world today, because the largest and most
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:28.080]   popular movements labeled as Christianity are selling happiness in this lifetime and holiness
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:34.160]   in the next. That's not biblical. It's a popular message that leads to the personal enrichment and
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:40.080]   popularization of preachers and teachers, but it's not biblical. The Bible teaches holiness
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.720]   in this lifetime, or righteousness would be a word that maybe would be easier to access than
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:51.200]   the word holiness. Holiness in this lifetime and happiness in the next. So there's a major
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.920]   difference. You'll often hear this emerge in my answering of questions, that I will always
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.560]   discount the role of personal happiness in answering the question of what you should do
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:08.400]   and emphasize the need to live righteously, because that's consistent with my worldview.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   You must do that in my worldview. But that's directly at odds with the secular humanist
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   worldview that teaches personal happiness as triumph. Now, what about community ethics? This
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   one is interesting because the secular humanist system of ethics assumes a dignity of human life,
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.040]   but there's no background or proof for it. The best proof that can come up with is almost a
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.640]   corporate sense of altruism, a sense of community spirit, kind of an evolved community spirit that
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.240]   somehow if human beings have evolved, then they've learned that this serves their common good.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.640]   But the problem is when you remove God from the equation, man is accident,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:58.240]   happenstance. And problematically, we're all engaged in the primal survival of the fittest war.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:08.320]   Now, it's whitewashed, but that's the underlying philosophy. And so this provides justification
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.400]   for many evil things. And by the way, I lay plenty of blame at those who argue for evil
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.320]   under the banner of God, Christian duty. Many evil things have been
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.440]   perpetuated on people in the name of God. That's what's so sad.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:32.480]   But there is actually a cogent and well-developed system of thought and a system of ethics behind
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.240]   the philosophy of secular humanism. The problem is that it's very difficult to find people who
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:44.320]   are actually willing to be clear in their thoughts and convey the system of ethics accurately.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.640]   In my study, most people who publicly represent this viewpoint in the system of ethics
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.680]   are, in my opinion, cowards because they don't declare their actual system of thinking.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:02.240]   Now, you say, "Cowards? That's a strong allegation." And anytime somebody makes a statement
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:09.280]   like that, you should ask for proof. And I'll share a little bit of – although I wouldn't
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.320]   necessarily call it proof. I'll share a little bit of evidence with you in just a moment.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:20.880]   But let me tie this back in again to finance because almost everything in that secular
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:28.080]   humanist manifesto connects back to some aspect of finance. For example, there's a massive push
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.520]   towards an internationalization of global systems of government. Well, how is that funded?
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:41.920]   It's funded with your dollars or your pounds or your euros or your Australian dollars or your – I
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:48.320]   don't know – shekels, your lira – well, not lira anymore. That one is – your yen, your yuan,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:54.080]   your renminbi. That's what funds it. That's what funds the global systems of government.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.960]   And you and I are the ones who fund the global systems of control.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.080]   You and I are the ones who participate in modern monetary systems. You and I are the ones who
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.000]   participate in the central banking system. You and I are the ones who participate in
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.720]   public equity markets. So we have a responsibility in it. But the problem is, at least for me,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:22.000]   is I've tried to study the influence of these things on finance, that the history and the
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.240]   research always seem so distant. It's hard to wrap my mind around. And in the world of finance,
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.360]   there are plenty of theories and plenty of theories of conspiracy and control and manipulation. But
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:40.320]   trying to sort out fact from fiction is incredibly challenging to me. Simple example. I don't have
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:46.240]   any clue what the actual impact was of the abolishment of the gold standard on American
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.280]   society because I wasn't there. And it's very difficult for me to actually conceive of the long
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.880]   reaching arc of history. It's very tough for me to understand how our populations moved,
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:04.240]   how our populations controlled, how do people exert influence and psychological influence over
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.960]   a society. That has been a major challenge for me to actually put together
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:19.040]   until I found something that was actually within my lifetime. That's what I'm going to share with
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:25.520]   you next. If you want to understand the way that psychological and sociological battles
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:33.360]   are waged and won, frankly, then the best example that I have ever come up with – and if you know
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.080]   of a better one, tell me. I'd like to study it. But the best example that I've ever come up with
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:44.160]   is to look at the promotion of homosexual culture in the broader US American culture.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.320]   I believe that no matter which side of this issue you personally stand on, you should be very
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:58.160]   interested in this battle. Now, the current battle in US American society is over the concept of
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:04.640]   homosexual marriage. It's my best guess that this June, the Supreme Court will release a ruling
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.800]   which will effectively overturn the last few remaining state bans on the concept of homosexual
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:17.040]   marriage. This has been a major influence in financial planning because traditionally in
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.840]   financial planning, there was an area of specialty of working with same-sex couples and there was a
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:27.680]   unique area of planning because of the lack of continuity in the laws for same-sex couples versus
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:34.720]   heterosexual couples. So there was a unique area of study. This will be changing. My best guess in
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.520]   June, I don't see any way that the court will not rule on the side of striking down these state
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.160]   bans. I could be wrong. We'll see. It would be interesting to find out. But that ruling that
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.920]   is expected this June will be a major, major milestone in the promotion of the homosexual
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.920]   lifestyle in modern culture. The reason that I'm highlighting this issue is because it's one of the
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.560]   fastest massive cultural changes that I'm aware of. One of the most fundamental transformations
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:09.360]   of a culture has occurred within my lifetime and I'm not yet 30. Here's how fast the actual legal
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:16.960]   transition has occurred. Reading from Wikipedia, "In the 1950s, all states had some form of law
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.640]   criminalizing sodomy," interrupting Wikipedia, sodomy referring to homosexual sex, but there
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.280]   are various definitions of that. But it's a general term that has different legal definitions
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.200]   depending on the jurisdiction that you're in, primarily understood to be homosexual sex,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.960]   especially among males. "In the 1950s, all states had some form of law criminalizing sodomy.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.880]   And in 1986, the United States Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:50.240]   bars a state from prohibiting sodomy." I was born in 1985. "1986, the United States Supreme Court
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.000]   ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution bars a state from prohibiting sodomy.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.040]   However, state legislators and state courts had started to repeal or overturn their sodomy laws,
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:09.040]   beginning with Illinois in 1961. And thus, in 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.280]   sodomy, with penalties ranging from one to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:24.080]   states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex sodomy. On June 26, 2003, the U.S.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.960]   Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision in Lawrence v. Texas, struck down the Texas same-sex sodomy law
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.240]   ruling that this private sexual conduct is protected by the liberty rights implicit in the
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.880]   due process clause of the United States Constitution, with Sandra Day O'Connor's concurring
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:48.160]   opinion arguing that they violated equal protection. This decision invalidated all state sodomy laws
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:54.640]   insofar as they applied to non-commercial conduct in private between consenting civilians and
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.400]   overruled its 1986 ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, which upheld Georgia's sodomy law.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.640]   Now, if you want to actually understand the strategy behind cultural change, then you need
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.880]   to study this movement. And we're going to start with an essay that I'm going to read you called
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.960]   The Overhauling of Straight America, and then a subsequent book which was entitled After the Ball,
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:21.360]   How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s. That book was published in 1989
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:27.040]   by two men, one named Marshall Kirk and one named Hunter Madsen, both men brilliant in their
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:33.120]   respective fields of study. Kirk was a researcher in neuropsychiatry, a logician, a poet, and a
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.880]   genealogist. And Madsen was an expert in public persuasion tactics and social marketing, and he
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.360]   designed commercial advertising on Madison Avenue. Both men were Harvard graduates.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:50.400]   Now, I have not yet read After the Ball. It's hard to find, and it costs basically $50 to $100
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.200]   to buy a used copy of it online, and I haven't been willing to pay the $50 to $100 to buy it.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.560]   Incidentally, if any of you own a copy of the book, I'd like to read the actual book. So feel
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.240]   free to get in touch with me, email me or contact me, and you can send it to me, and I'll read it
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.760]   and send it back. But I've read enough detailed outlines with extensive quotations from the book
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.080]   that I feel confident they have an accurate understanding of the content. And I've read
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.120]   enough critiques and analysis of it that I feel like I understand what's in the book. But again,
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.800]   there could be something that I don't know in that. But you can get the gist of it by reading
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.080]   the original essay called The Overhauling of Straight America, which is what I'm going to read
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.000]   you, because this essay clearly lays out the plan for this transformation of culture.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.360]   And I want you to be aware of the language and of the plan, because you've got to – depending
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.080]   on your worldview, again, if you are on the side that promotes homosexual culture and modern
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:52.400]   culture, then you should be referencing this as a major milestone of massive success of societal
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.920]   transformation. And if you're on the opposite side of the issue, then you should be understanding
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:05.600]   this to understand the war of ideas and how it's waged. And the reason that I'm using this in a
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:13.440]   podcast on finance is you need to understand how culture works, because the same type of plan
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:21.440]   is being laid out over a longer period of time on many significant issues.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.960]   And that's what we're constantly working through as individual people,
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.280]   individual citizens, trying to figure out what's happening in our own
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:36.320]   jurisdictions of government, what's actually happening with the various agendas that are
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.040]   being waged in which we are pawns, we are useful pawns on a chessboard.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   So as I read this, pay careful attention to your memory of the past, say, 20 years,
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.360]   and how this strategy has been affected in the culture in which you've been a participant.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:03.680]   This essay was published in November 1987 in Guide magazine. It's entitled The Overhauling
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.680]   of Straight America. The byline here is Marshall Kirk. And in this article, it was – Hunter Madsen
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.640]   went by the pen name of Erastus Pill. The first order of business is desensitization of the
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:22.080]   American public concerning gays and gay rights. To desensitize the public is to help it view
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.160]   homosexuality with indifference instead of with keen emotion. Ideally, we would have straights
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.200]   register differences in sexual preference the way they register different tastes for ice cream
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:39.680]   or sports games. She likes strawberry and I like vanilla. He follows baseball and I follow football.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.600]   No big deal. At least in the beginning, we are seeking public desensitization and nothing more.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:52.560]   We do not need and cannot expect a full appreciation or understanding of homosexuality
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.440]   from the average American. You can forget about trying to persuade the masses that homosexuality
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:02.480]   is a good thing. But if only you can get them to think that it is just another thing with a shrug
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:08.240]   of their shoulders, then your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won. And to get
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:16.480]   to the shoulder shrug stage, gays as a class must cease to appear mysterious, alien, loathsome,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.640]   and contrary. A large-scale media campaign will be required in order to change the image of gays
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.800]   in America. And any campaign to accomplish this turnaround should do six things. One,
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:35.520]   talk about gays and gayness as loudly and as often as possible. The principle behind this
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.960]   advice is simple. Almost any behavior begins to look normal if you are exposed to enough of it at
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.400]   close quarters and among your acquaintances. The acceptability of the new behavior will ultimately
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.800]   hinge on the number of one's fellows doing it or accepting it. One may be offended by its novelty
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.280]   at first. Many in times past were momentarily scandalized by streaking, eating goldfish,
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.600]   and premarital sex. But as long as Joe Six-Pack feels little pressure to perform likewise,
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.600]   and as long as the behavior in question presents little threat to his physical and financial
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:16.800]   security, he soon gets used to it and life goes on. The skeptic may still shake his head and think,
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.080]   "People are crazy these days," but over time his objections are likely to become more reflective,
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:30.880]   more philosophical, less emotional. The way to benumb raw sensitivities about homosexuality
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.960]   is to have a lot of people talk a great deal about the subject in a neutral or supportive way.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:43.200]   Open and frank talk makes the subject seem less furtive, alien, and sinful, more above board.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.880]   Constant talk builds the impression that public opinion is at least divided on the subject,
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.760]   and that a sizable segment accepts or even practices homosexuality. Even rancorous debates
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.240]   between opponents and defenders serve the purpose of desensitization so long as respectable gays
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.280]   are front and center to make their own pitch. The main thing is to talk about gayness until
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:13.280]   the issue becomes thoroughly tiresome. And when we say talk about homosexuality, we mean just that.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.000]   In the early stages of any campaign to reach straight America, the masses should not be
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.080]   shocked and repelled by premature exposure to homosexual behavior itself. Instead, the imagery
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:31.120]   of sex should be downplayed, and gay rights should be reduced to an abstract social question as much
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:39.120]   as possible. First, let the camel get his nose inside the tent. Only later, his unsightly derriere.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:46.240]   Where we talk is important. The visual media, film, and television are plainly the most powerful
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.760]   image makers in Western civilization. The average American household watches over seven hours of TV
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:57.520]   daily. Those hours open up a gateway into the private world of straights, through which a
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:03.440]   Trojan horse might be passed. As far as desensitization is concerned, the medium is the
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:09.920]   message of normalcy. So far, gay Hollywood has provided our best covert weapon in the battle to
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:16.720]   desensitize the mainstream. Bit by bit over the past 10 years, gay characters and gay themes have
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.680]   been introduced into TV programs and films, though often this has been done to achieve comedic and
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:28.240]   ridiculous effects. On the whole, the impact has been encouraging. The prime time presentation of
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.880]   consenting adults on a major network in 1985 is but one high-water mark in favorable media exposure
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:42.000]   of gay issues. But this should be just the beginning of a major publicity blitz by gay America.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.400]   Would a desensitizing campaign of open and sustained talk about gay issues reach every
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.160]   rabid opponent of homosexuality? Of course not. While public opinion is one primary source of
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:19:00.400]   mainstream values, religious authority is the other. When conservative churches condemn gays,
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.160]   there are only two things we can do to confound the homophobia of true believers. First, we can
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:12.000]   use talk to muddy the moral waters. This means publicizing support for gays by more moderate
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.360]   churches, raising theological objections of our own about conservative interpretations of biblical
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.640]   teachings, and exposing hatred and inconsistency. Second, we can undermine the moral authority of
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:30.320]   homophobic churches by portraying them as antiquated backwaters, badly out of step with
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.600]   the times and with the latest findings of psychology. Against the mighty pull of institutional
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:41.920]   religion, one must set the mightier draw of science and public opinion, the shield and
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:48.160]   sword of that accursed "secular humanism." Such an unholy alliance has worked well against churches
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:56.240]   before on such topics as divorce and abortion. With enough open talk about the prevalence and
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:04.640]   acceptability of homosexuality, that alliance can work again here. Two, portray gays as victims,
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:11.280]   not as aggressive challengers. In any campaign to win over the public, gays must be cast as
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:17.120]   victims in need of protection, so the straights will be inclined by reflex to assume the role
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:23.520]   of protector. If gays are presented instead as a strong and prideful tribe promoting a rigidly
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.400]   nonconformist and deviant lifestyle, they are more likely to be seen as a public menace that
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:34.160]   justifies resistance and oppression. For that reason, we must forego the temptation to strut
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.880]   our gay pride publicly when it conflicts with the gay victim image, and we must walk the fine line
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.280]   between impressing straights with our great numbers on the one hand and sparking their
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:52.560]   hostile paranoia there all around us on the other. A media campaign to promote the gay victim image
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.680]   should make use of symbols which reduce the mainstream's sense of threat, which lower its
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:03.280]   guard and which enhance the plausibility of victimization. In practical terms, this means
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.960]   that jaunty mustachioed musclemen would keep very low profile in gay commercials and other public
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.880]   presentations, while sympathetic figures of nice young people, old people, and attractive women
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.480]   would be featured. It almost goes without saying that groups on the farthest margin of acceptability
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:27.920]   such as NAMBLA, editor's note, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, must play no part at all
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:34.240]   in such a campaign. Suspected child molesters will never look like victims. Now, there are two
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.200]   different messages about the gay victim that are worth communicating. First, the mainstream should
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:45.920]   be told that gays are victims of fate, in the sense that most never had a choice to accept or
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:52.080]   reject their sexual preference. The message must read, "As far as gays can tell, they were born gay,
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:58.160]   just as you were born heterosexual or white or black or bright or athletic. Nobody ever tricked
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.320]   or seduced them. They never made a choice and are not morally blameworthy. What they do isn't
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.280]   willfully contrary. It's only natural for them. This twist of fate could as easily have happened
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:17.760]   to you." Straight viewers must be able to identify with gays as victims. Mr. and Mrs. Public must be
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:24.320]   given no extra excuses to say, "They are not like us." To this end, the persons featured in the
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:30.080]   public campaign should be decent and upright, appealing and admirable by straight standards,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:35.680]   completely unexceptionable in appearance. In a word, they should be indistinguishable from the
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:41.200]   straights we would like to reach. To return to the terms we have used in previous articles,
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:48.400]   spokesmen for our cause must be R-type straight gays rather than Q-type homosexuals on display.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:54.320]   Only under such conditions will the message be read correctly. These folks are victims of a fate
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:01.040]   that could have happened to me. By the way, we realize that many gays will question an advertising
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.640]   technique, which might threaten to make homosexuality look like some dreadful disease,
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:13.600]   which strikes fated victims. But the plain fact is that the gay community is weak and must
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:20.640]   manipulate the powers of the weak, including the play for sympathy. In any case, we compensate for
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.480]   the negative aspects of this gay victim appeal under principle four below. The second message
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:32.560]   would portray gays as victims of society. The straight majority does not recognize the suffering
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:38.880]   it brings to the lives of gays and must be shown. Graphic pictures of brutalized gays,
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:45.200]   dramatizations of job and housing insecurity, loss of child custody and public humiliation,
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:52.480]   and the dismal list goes on. "In any campaign to win over the public, gays must be cast as victims
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:58.960]   in need of protection so that straights will be inclined by reflex to assume the role of protector."
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:10.960]   Three, give protectors a just cause. A media campaign that casts gays as society's victims
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.640]   and encourages straights to be their protectors must make it easier for those to respond,
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:23.760]   to assert, and explain their new protectiveness. Few straight women, and even fewer straight men,
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:29.920]   will want to defend homosexuality boldly as such. Most would rather attach their awakened
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.240]   protective impulse to some principle of justice or law, to some general desire for consistent
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:43.120]   and fair treatment in society. Our campaign should not demand direct support for homosexual practices,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:49.040]   should instead take anti-discrimination as its theme, the right to free speech, freedom of
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.320]   beliefs, freedom of association, due process, and equal protection of laws. These should be
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.480]   the concerns brought to mind by our campaign. It is especially important for the gay movement to
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:06.880]   hitch its cause to accepted standards of law and justice because its straight supporters must have
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:14.000]   at hand a cogent reply to the moral arguments of its enemies. The homophobes clothe their emotional
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.720]   revulsion in the daunting robes of religious dogma, so defenders of gay rights must be ready
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:29.600]   to counter dogma with principle. Four, make gays look good. In order to make a gay victim
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:35.280]   sympathetic to straights, you have to portray him as every man. But an additional theme of the
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:41.920]   campaign should be more aggressive and upbeat to offset the increasingly bad press that these times
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.680]   have brought to homosexual men and women. The campaign should paint gays as superior pillars
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:54.000]   of society. Yes, yes, we know, this trick is so old it creaks. Other minorities use it all the
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:02.480]   time in ads that announce proudly, "Did you know that this great man or woman was blank?" But the
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.960]   message is vital for all those straights who still picture gays as queer people, shadowy, lonesome,
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:15.920]   fail, drunken, suicidal, child-snatching misfits. The honor roll of prominent gay or bisexual men
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.840]   and women is truly eye-popping. From Socrates to Shakespeare, from Alexander the Great to Alexander
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:30.000]   Hamilton, from Michelangelo to Walt Whitman, from Sappho to Gertrude Stein, the list is old hat to
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.880]   us, but shocking news to heterosexual America. In no time, a skillful and clever media campaign
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.440]   could have the gay community looking like the veritable fairy godmother to Western civilization.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:47.120]   Along the same lines, we shouldn't overlook the celebrity endorsement. The celebrities can be
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:55.360]   straight—God bless you, Ed Asner, wherever you are—or gay. 5. Make the victimizers look bad.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.440]   At a later stage of the media campaign for gay rights, long after other gay ads have become
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:08.480]   commonplace, it will be time to get tough with remaining opponents. To be blunt, they must be
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.240]   vilified. This will be all the more necessary because by that time, the entrenched enemy will
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:22.160]   have quadrupled its output of vitriol and disinformation. Our goal is here is twofold.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:28.000]   First, we seek to replace the mainstream's self-righteous pride about its homophobia
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:35.440]   with shame and guilt. Second, we intend to make the anti-gays look so nasty that average Americans
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:42.960]   will want to disassociate themselves from such types. The public should be shown images of
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.960]   ranting homophobes whose secondary traits and beliefs disgust Middle America. These images
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.640]   might include the Ku Klux Klan demanding that gays be burned alive or castrated, bigoted Southern
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.480]   ministers drooling with hysterical hatred to a degree that looks both comical and deranged,
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.720]   menacing punks, thugs, and convicts speaking coolly about the "fags" they have killed or would like
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.000]   to kill, a tour of Nazi concentration camps where homosexuals were tortured and gassed.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.400]   A campaign to vilify the victimizers is going to enrage our most fervid enemies, of course.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:25.440]   But what else can we say? The shoe fits, and we should make them try it on for size,
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:32.240]   with all of America watching. Six, solicit funds. The buck stops here.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.960]   Any massive campaign of this kind would require unprecedented expenditures for months or even
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:45.600]   years, an unprecedented fundraising drive. Effective advertising is a costly proposition.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.000]   Several million dollars would get the ball rolling. There are 10 to 15 million primarily
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.440]   homosexual adults in this country. If each one of them donated just two dollars to the campaign,
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.720]   its war chest would actually rival that of its most vocal enemies. And because those gays not
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.360]   supporting families usually have more discretionary income than average, they could afford to
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:12.880]   contribute much more. "We intend to make the anti-gays look so nasty that average Americans
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:21.600]   will want to dissociate themselves from such types." But would they? Or is the gay community
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:28.320]   as feckless, selfish, uncommitted, and short-sighted as its critics claim? We will never know unless
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:34.080]   the new campaign simultaneously launches a concerted nationwide appeal for funding support
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.040]   from both known and anonymous donors. The appeal should be directed both at gays and at straights
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:47.200]   who care about social justice. In the beginning, for reasons to be explained in a moment,
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:52.480]   the appeal for funds may have to be launched exclusively through the gay press, national
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:59.040]   magazines, local newspapers, flyers at bars, notices in glossy skin magazines. Funds could
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.840]   also come through the outreach of local gay organizations on campuses and in metropolitan
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:09.520]   areas. Eventually, donations would be solicited directly alongside advertisements in the major
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:14.560]   straight media. There would be no parallel to such an effort in the history of the gay community
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:19.760]   in America. If it failed to generate the needed capital to get started, there would be little
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:25.520]   hope for the campaign and little hope for major progress toward gay rights in the near future.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.120]   For the moment, let us suppose that gays could see how donations would greatly serve their
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:36.720]   long-term interest and that sufficient funds could be raised. An heroic assumption.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:44.640]   Getting on the air, or you can't get there from here. Without access to TV, radio, and the
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:51.120]   mainstream press, there will be no campaign. This is a tricky problem because many impresarios of
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:56.880]   the media simply refuse to accept what they call "issue advertising." Persuasive advertising can
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:01.920]   provoke a storm of resentment from the public and from sponsors, which is bad for business.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:08.080]   The courts have confirmed the broadcaster's right to refuse any "issue advertising" he dislikes.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:14.880]   What exactly constitutes "issue advertising"? It evidently does not include platitudinous appeals
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:20.080]   to the virtues of family unity, courtesy of the Mormons. Neither does it include tirades against
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:28.400]   perfidious Albion courtesy of Lyndon LaRouche. Neither does it include reminders that "a mind
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:34.000]   is a terrible thing to waste" courtesy of the United Negro College Fund. Neither does it include
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.920]   religious shows which condemn gay sinners. Neither does it include condemnations of nuclear war or
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.760]   race discrimination, at least not in Massachusetts. Some guys get all the breaks. What "issue
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:51.840]   advertising" does include these days is almost any communique presented openly by a homosexual
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:59.120]   organization. The words "gay" and "homosexual" are considered controversial whenever they appear.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:05.360]   Because most straightforward appeals are impossible, the National Gay Task Force has
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:11.200]   had to cultivate quiet backroom liaisons with broadcast companies and newsrooms in order to
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.920]   make sure that issues important to the gay community receive some coverage. But such an
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:20.960]   arrangement is hardly ideal, of course, because it means that the gay community's image is controlled
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:27.360]   by the latest news event instead of by careful design. And recently, most of the news about gays
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:34.000]   has been negative. So what can be done to crash the gates of the major media? Several things,
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.800]   advanced in several stages. Start with the fine print. Newspapers and magazines may
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.120]   very well be hungrier for gay advertising dollars than television and radio are, and the cost of
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.320]   ads in print is generally lower. But remember that the press, for the most part, is only read by
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.920]   better-educated Americans, many of who are already more accepting of homosexuality in any case.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:03.600]   So to get more impact for our dollars, we should skip the New Republic and new left review readers
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:09.520]   and head for Time, People, and The National Enquirer. Of course, the gay community may have
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:14.320]   to establish itself as a regular advertising presence in more sophisticated forums first
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   before it is accepted into the mass press. While we're storming the battlements with salvos of ink,
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:28.960]   we should also warm the mainstream up a bit with a subtle national campaign on highway billboards.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:36.480]   In simple bold print on dark backgrounds, a series of unobjectionable messages should be introduced.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:46.560]   "In Russia, they tell you what to be. In America, we have the freedom to be ourselves
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:54.320]   and to be the best." Or, "People helping instead of hating, that's what America is all about."
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:02.000]   And so on. Each sign will tap patriotic sentiment. Each message will drill a seemingly agreeable
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.720]   proposition into mainstream heads, a public service message suited to our purposes. And,
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:13.680]   if heir owners will permit it, each billboard will be signed in slightly smaller letters,
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.880]   courtesy of the National Gay Task Force, to build positive associations and get the public used to
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:25.120]   seeing such sponsorship. Visual Stage 1. You Really Ought to Be in Pictures
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:33.200]   As for television and radio, a more elaborate plan may be needed to break the ice. For openers,
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:38.240]   naturally, we must continue to encourage the appearance of favorable gay characters in films
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:45.200]   and TV shows. Daytime talk shows also remain a useful avenue for exposure. But to speed things
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:52.000]   up, we might consider a bold stratagem to gain media attention. The scheme we have in mind would
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.960]   require careful preparations, yet it would save expense even while it elevated the visibility
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.880]   and stature of the gay movement overnight. Well before the next elections for national office,
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:08.800]   we might lay careful plans to run symbolic gay candidates for every high political office in
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.640]   this country. Such plans would have to deal somehow with the tricky problem of inducing
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.360]   gays and straights to sign enough endorsement petitions to get us on the ballot. Our 50 to
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:28.240]   250 candidates would participate in such debates as they could, run gay-themed advertisements
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.840]   coordinated at our national headquarters, and demand equal time on the air. They could then
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.760]   graciously pull out of the races before the actual elections, while formally endorsing more viable
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.920]   straight contenders. With malicious humor, perhaps, in some states, we could endorse our most rabid
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:52.320]   opponents. It is essential not to ask people actually to vote "yay" or "nay" on the gay
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:58.160]   issue at this early stage. Such action would end up committing most to the "nay" position,
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:04.240]   and would only tally huge and visible defeats for our cause. Through such a political campaign,
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.280]   the mainstream would get over the initial shock of seeing gay ads, and the acceptability of such
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:15.520]   ads would be fortified by the most creditable context possible. And all this would be accomplished
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.360]   before non-electoral advertising was attempted by the gay community. During the campaign,
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.800]   all hell would break loose, but if we behaved courageously and respectable, our drive would
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:36.560]   gain legitimacy in and case, and might even become a cause celebre. It's probably pronounced a cause
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.400]   celebre. If all went as planned, the somewhat desensitized public and the major networks
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.920]   themselves would be "readied" for the next step of our program.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:53.440]   Visual Stage 2. Peekaboo Advertising. At this point, the gay community has its foot in the door,
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:37:01.760]   and it is time to ask the networks to accept gay sponsorship of certain ads and shows. Timing is
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:07.600]   critical. The request must be made immediately after our national political ads disappear.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.120]   Failing that, we should request sponsorship the next time one of the networks struts its
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:19.520]   broad-mindedness by televising a film or show with gay characters or themes. If they wish to look
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.720]   consistent instead of hypocritical, we'll have them on the spot. But the networks would still
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.800]   be forced to say no unless we made their resistance look patently unreasonable and
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:39.280]   possibly illegal. We'd do just that by proposing "gay ads" patterned exactly after those currently
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:46.000]   sponsored by the Mormons and others. As usual, viewers would be treated to squeak-clean skits
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.240]   on the importance of family harmony and understanding. This time, the narrator would
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:57.760]   end by saying "this message was brought to you by the National Gay Task Force." All very quiet
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:07.520]   and subdued. Remember, exposure is everything, and the medium is the message. "Exposure is
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.720]   everything and the medium is the message." The gay community should join forces with other civil
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.520]   liberties groups of respectable caste to promote bland messages about America the melting pot,
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.200]   always ending with an explicit reference to the task force of some other gay organization.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:32.320]   Making the best of a bad situation, we can also propose sympathetic media appeals for gifts and
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.560]   donations to fund AIDS research. If Jerry Lewis and the March of Dimes can do it, so can we.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.880]   Our next indirect step will be to advertise locally on behalf of support groups peripheral
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:50.800]   to the gay community. Frowsy straight moms and dads announcing phone numbers and meeting times for
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.880]   parents of gays or similar gatherings. Can't you just see how such ads now presented between
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:07.360]   messages from the disabled vets and the postal workers union?
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:17.040]   Visual Stage 3. Roll out the big guns. By this point, our salami tactics will have carved out,
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:23.040]   slice by slice, a large portion of access to the mainstream media. So what then? It would
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:28.800]   finally be time to bring gay ads out of the closet. The messages of such ads should directly
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.360]   address lingering public fears about homosexuals as loathsome and contrary aliens. For example,
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.560]   the following are possible formats for TV or radio commercials designed to chip away at chronic
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:48.560]   misperceptions. Format A for Familiarization. The Testimonial. To make gays seem less mysterious,
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:53.920]   present a series of short spots featuring the boy or girl next door, fresh and appealing,
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:00.400]   or warm and lovable grandma/grandpa types. Seated in homey surroundings, they respond to an off-camera
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.200]   interviewer with assurance, good nature, and charm. Their comments bring out three social facts.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:13.600]   1. There is someone special in their life, a long-term relationship. To stress gay stability,
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.680]   monogamy, and commitment. 2. Their families are very important to them and are supportive of them.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:26.480]   To stress that gays are not anti-family and that families need not be anti-gay. 3. As far as they
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.680]   can remember, they have always been gay and were probably born gay. They certainly never decided
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.000]   on a preference one way or the other, stressing that gays are doing what is natural for them and
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.120]   are not being willfully contrary. The subjects should be interviewed alone, not with their
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:46.560]   lovers or children, for to include others in the picture would unwisely raise disturbing questions
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.600]   about the complexities of gay social relations, which these commercials could not explain.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:58.560]   It is best instead to take one thing at a time. Format B for Positive Associations. The Celebrity
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.600]   Spot. While it might be useful to present celebrity endorsements by currently popular gay
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.440]   figures and straight sympathizers, Johnny Mathis, Marlo Thomas, the homophobia climate of America
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.120]   would make such brash endorsements unlikely in the near future. So early celebrity spots will
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.120]   instead identify historical gay or bisexual personalities who are illustrious and dignified
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:29.120]   and dead. The ads could be sardonic and indirect. For example, over regal music and a portrait or
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:35.360]   two, a narrator might announce simply, "Michelangelo, an art class. Tchaikovsky, a music
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:43.520]   class. Tennessee Williams, a drama class," etc. Format C for Victim Sympathy. Our Campaign to Stop
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:49.840]   Child Abuse. As we said earlier, there are many ways to portray gays as victims of discrimination,
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:55.840]   images of brutality, tales of job loss and family separation, and so on. But we think something like
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.440]   the following 30-second commercials would get to the heart of the matter best of all.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.800]   The camera slowly moves in on a middle-class teenager sitting alone in his semi-darkened
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:10.400]   bedroom. The boy is pleasing and unexceptional in appearance, except that he has been roughed up
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:17.120]   and is staring silently, pensively, with evident distress. As the camera gradually focuses in on
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:23.760]   his face, a narrator comments, "It will happen to one in every ten sons. As he grows up, he will
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.040]   realize that he feels differently about things than most of his friends. If he lets it show,
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:35.120]   he'll be an outsider, made fun of, humiliated, attacked. If he confides in his parents,
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:40.560]   they may throw him out of the house, onto the streets. Some will say he is anti-family.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:47.840]   Nobody will let him be himself. So he will have to hide from his friends, his family,
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.480]   and that's hard. It's tough enough to be a kid these days, but to be the one in ten."
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.160]   A message from the National Gay Task Force. What is nice about such an ad is that it would
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:03.840]   economically portray gays as innocent and vulnerable, victimized and misunderstood,
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:11.200]   surprisingly numerous, yet not menacing. It also renders the anti-family charge absurd and
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:18.080]   hypocritical. Format D for identification with victims, the old switcheroo. The mainstream will
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:23.360]   identify better with the plight of gays if straights can, once in a while, walk a mile in
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:28.480]   gay shoes. A humorous television or radio ad to help them do this might involve a brief animated
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:33.840]   or dramatized scenario as follows. The camera approaches the mighty oak door of the boss's
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.320]   office, which swings open, and the camera, which represents you, the viewer, enters the room.
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:44.160]   Behind the oversized desk sits a fat and scowling old curmudgeon chomping on a cigar.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:49.600]   He looks up at the camera, i.e. at the viewer and snarls, "So it's you, Smithers. Well, you're fired."
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.000]   The voice of a younger man is heard to reply with astonishment, "B-b-b-but Mr. Thornburg,
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.800]   I've been with your company for ten years. I thought you liked my work."
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.720]   The boss responds with a tone of disgust, "Yes, yes, Smithers, your work is quite adequate,
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.120]   but I've heard rumors that you've been seen around town with some kind of girlfriend.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.840]   A girlfriend. Frankly, I'm shocked. We're not about to start hiring any heterosexuals in this
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.960]   company. Now get out." The younger man speaks once more, "But boss, that's just not fair.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:22.320]   What if it were you?" The boss glowers back as the camera pulls quickly out of the room and the big
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.120]   door slams shut. Printed on the door, a message from the National Gay Task Force.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.560]   One can easily imagine similar episodes involving housing or other discrimination.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.720]   Format E for vilification of victimizers, "Damn the torpedoes." We have already indicated some
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:43.840]   of the images which might be damaging to the homophobic vendetta. Ranting and hateful religious
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:50.320]   extremists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux Klansmen made to look evil and ridiculous. Hardly a difficult
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:57.600]   task. These images should be combined with those of their gay victims by a method propagandists
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   call the bracket technique. For example, for a few seconds, an unctuous, beady-eyed Southern
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.200]   preacher is seen pounding the pulpit in rage about those "those sick, abominable creatures."
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:15.040]   While his tirade continues over the soundtrack, the picture switches to pathetic photos of gays
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:20.080]   who look decent, harmless, and likable. And then we cut back to the poisonous face of the preacher
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:28.560]   and so forth. The contrast speaks for itself. The effect is devastating. "It would portray gays as
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.440]   innocent and vulnerable, victimized and misunderstood, surprisingly numerous, yet not
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:42.480]   menacing." Format F for funds, SOS. Alongside or during these other persuasive advertisements,
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:47.840]   we would have to solicit donation so that the campaign might continue. Direct appeals from
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:54.480]   celebrities, preferably living, preferable living ones, thank you, might be useful here. All appeals
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:00.640]   must stress that money can be given anonymously, e.g. via money orders, and that all donations are
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:07.840]   confidential. "We can't help unless you help," and all that. The time is now. We have sketched
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:12.880]   out here a blueprint for transforming the social values of straight America. At the core of our
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:18.320]   program is a media campaign to change the way the average citizen views homosexuality. It is quite
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.200]   easy to fall in fault with such a campaign. We have tried to be practical and specific here,
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:29.120]   but the proposals may still have a visionary sheen. There are 100 reasons why the campaign
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:34.320]   could not be done or would be risky, but there are at least 20 million good reasons why some
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:39.600]   such program must be tried in the coming years. The welfare and happiness of every gay man and
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:46.480]   woman in this country demand it. As the last large, legally oppressed minority in American society,
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:52.000]   it is high time that gays took effective measures to rejoin the mainstream in pride and strength.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.120]   We believe that, like it or not, such a campaign is the only way of doing so anytime soon.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:06.320]   And let us repeat, time may be running out. The AIDS epidemic is sparking anger and fear
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.360]   in the heartland of straight America. As the virus leaks out of homosexual circles and into
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:17.520]   the rest of society, we need have no illusions about who is receiving the blame. The 10 years
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:23.760]   ahead may decide for the next 40 whether gays claim their liberty and equality or are driven
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:32.320]   back once again as America's cast of detested untouchables. It's more than a quip. Speak now,
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:39.120]   or forever hold your peace. That's the close of the article, again, published November 1987.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:48.400]   Now, there's a reason why I read you that article. That is the most effective social movement in
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:56.480]   modern society that I'm aware of. And there you have – so 1987 would be 27 years ago.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:05.760]   There you have the blueprint that was laid out 27 years ago. And I expect in a couple of months
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:13.760]   that the US Supreme Court will overturn the final homosexual marriage bans in American society.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.560]   The reason why I've emphasized that and I'm presenting it to you – I presented it to you
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.440]   without comment, not a single stop, not a single – everything that you just heard was presented
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:29.200]   without comment. You need to understand the movement and how people desire to move in
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:37.440]   different causes and effects, in different situations. Because although that – the
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:43.600]   homosexual movement is on the periphery of finance, the real only – the only application to the world
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.840]   of finance would be in changing the role of financial planning for homosexual couples.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.840]   That's a role that's changing. But that's on the periphery of finance. But it's an example
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:01.920]   of social movements, planned social movements and propaganda and how those function in modern
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:09.760]   society. Once you understand the tactics and tools of propaganda, then you might be able to
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.480]   develop some deeper critical thinking skills to protect yourself against
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.320]   the ways that they are used against you in financial topics.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.480]   So there's one thing that wasn't covered in there that I think is important from the
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.320]   subsequent book of that article. That article is essentially the outline of the book. But then
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.920]   they developed it into the book After the Ball, How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:36.640]   the Gays in the 1990s. That one I believe was published in 1989 if memory is correct.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:42.480]   So I'm going to read you a couple of short sections. It's a large book. I will link to this
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.040]   – these notes. There's a system of notes that I found on a website. It's a PDF that I found on
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.200]   a website called comingoutstraight.com. It was compiled by a man named Richard Cohen.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:58.640]   And these notes are his in-detailed notes from the book After the Ball. But I want to pull some
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.000]   lessons from this because this is the one thing that's missing in the article that was in the book.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.600]   First, from page two of his notes, page 10 and 11 of the book, he quotes this. "Homosexuality must
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.240]   be" – and these are not direct quotes. These are – because I'm not sure in his notes exactly what's
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:20.640]   a direct quote and what's not. So these are accurate but I don't want you to believe that
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.080]   these are direct quotes because I'm not sure if they are or not. I don't have the book.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.440]   "Homosexuality needs to be portrayed as either a one permanent condition or two temporary problem
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:36.080]   that can be fixed or can be portrayed as either – homosexuality portrayed as either a one permanent
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:40.480]   condition or two temporary problem that can be fixed. This distinction between problem and
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.920]   condition is crucial to the way straights think about homosexuality. A problem has a solution.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.200]   A condition doesn't need to be fixed. It is simply an aspect of life that must be accommodated.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.280]   It requires permanent tolerance and you must come to terms with it psychologically,
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:00.320]   practically, and morally. Must change public opinion from problem to condition." That's
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:05.520]   from pages 10 to 11. If you think about that, that's the concept of – I pull from that a
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:12.000]   concept called framing where anytime you can frame the debate in a subject, then you're going to
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.440]   basically present the options and you're going to be the one who is in control of the different
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.320]   potential options. In many ways, I'm doing that on my show right now. I'm the one who is framing
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:29.600]   this discussion. I'm choosing the topics that I am presenting to you. I'm choosing the information
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:35.840]   that I'm presenting to you and I'm essentially presenting one side or the other. I am using the
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:41.280]   dichotomy of contrasting and worldviews and I do this on the show. I'm presenting to you.
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:46.640]   The contrast between biblical Christianity and secular humanism. And so I'm basically using that
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.800]   debate. But you need to be careful anytime you are considering a subject because not all subjects are
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:58.960]   either one or the other. Now in this case, the homosexual movement and the homosexual activists
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:06.960]   have succeeded completely in framing that debate. Is it a problem or is it a condition? And
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:13.040]   essentially, they have hammered on that theme over the past 30 years of the public relations campaign
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:18.080]   until it's commonly accepted in society and almost every aspect of society with a few
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:23.680]   small groups that believe differently that homosexuality is an inborn characteristic.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:31.200]   That it's not based upon external factors. And there are very few, very broadly criticized
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:40.560]   segments of society that don't hold to that claim. But the mainstream view is that homosexuality is
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:47.680]   an inborn, unchangeable problem. That perception was not always thus. That perception has been
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:54.800]   changed over the last 30 years based upon the success of this outline, this guide for changing
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.840]   the perception of Americans and the success of these authors with designing their plan.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:03.920]   Now the one thing that was covered in the book that I want to read from these notes here
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:10.960]   is what do you do when the conversation happens? This is important because as you think back over
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:15.120]   the last three years of your observation of public – excuse me, 30 years of your observation of
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:22.800]   public media, you should be able to understand and look and see various things – various aspects of
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:29.760]   this happening. And it's important to know as these authors put it here what their strategy was.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:36.400]   And this is specifically under I think they're chapter 16 or they're section 16 where it's how
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:41.920]   to halt, derail and/or reverse the engine of prejudice. That's how they – this is the tools
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:48.240]   they give in the book for how to overcome prejudice and bigotry toward homosexuals.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:53.200]   And these are the techniques. These are the same techniques that are applied in financial spaces
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:59.520]   and financial spheres. But I don't have an equivalent campaign that – or at least with
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:04.320]   public documents that I can point to because these things go much farther than our generational
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.920]   lifetime. But you need to learn to be able to insulate yourself and protect yourself from the
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:13.440]   propaganda. So I'm reading here from page seven of these notes that are compiled and these are
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:22.800]   this man Richard Cohen's notes pulled together of this book. So quote from page 146 of the book,
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:29.200]   "First you get your foot in the door by being as similar as possible. Then and only then when your
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.080]   one little difference is finally accepted, can you start dragging in your other peculiarities
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:41.520]   one by one. You hammer in the wedge narrow end first. As the saying goes, allow the camel's
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:49.280]   nose beneath your tent and his whole body will soon follow." How to halt, derail and/or reverse
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:56.640]   the engine of prejudice. Step one, desensitization. Prejudice is an alerting signal. Warns tribal
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:00.560]   mammals that a potential alien mammal is in the vicinity and should be fought or fled.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:06.480]   Two things can happen. One, strong or weak stimulus. Fight it or flee from it. And two,
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.640]   low-grade stimulus. Don't take action against it. Irrelevancy. Get used to it.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.080]   If homosexuals present themselves as different and threatening, then straights go on alert and
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:21.200]   fight against them. To desensitize straights, homosexuals inundate them with conscious flood
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.160]   of homosexual-related advertising, presented in the least offensive fashion. If straights can't
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:32.160]   shut the shower off, they may at least eventually get used to being wet. Stage two, jamming.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.040]   Insertion of incompatible emotion into the preexisting system, like sprinkling sand into
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:42.560]   a pocket watch. Jamming is more active and aggressive than desensitization. Jamming uses
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:47.440]   the rules of associative conditioning. When two things are repeatedly juxtaposed,
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.240]   one's feelings about one thing are transferred to the other, and direct emotional modeling,
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.400]   the inborn tendency of human beings to feel what they perceive others to be feeling.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:03.200]   Consequent internal confusion has two effects. Unpleasant or emotional dissonance will tend to
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:08.800]   result in an alteration of previous beliefs and feelings, so as to resolve the internal conflict.
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:14.480]   And second, the internal dissonance will tend to inhibit overexpression of the prejudicial emotion,
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:20.000]   which is in itself useful and relieving. All normal people feel shame when they perceive
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.720]   that they are not thinking, feeling, or acting like one of the pack. The trick is to get the
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.240]   bigot into the position of feeling a conflicting twinge of shame, along with his reward,
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:35.280]   whenever his homo-hatred surfaces, so that his reward will be diluted or spoiled.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.080]   Quick note from Joshua here. This next paragraph has a few unpleasant words. I'm going to read
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.560]   them directly, but if you need to skip forward 30 seconds to skip a few unpleasant words for
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:52.800]   your children, duly noted. Next, "Propagandistic advertising can depict homophobic and homo-hating
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:58.960]   bigots as crude loudmouths and assholes, people who say not only 'faggot' but 'nigger,' 'kike,'
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:04.880]   and other shameful epithets who are 'not Christian.' It can show them being criticized,
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:09.680]   hated, shunned. It can depict homosexuals experiencing horrific suffering as the
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:15.120]   direct result of homo-hatred, suffering of which even most bigots would be ashamed to be the cause.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:21.040]   It can, in short, link homo-hating bigotry with all sorts of attributes the bigot would be ashamed
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:26.480]   to possess, and with social consequences he would find unpleasant and scary. The attack,
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:32.720]   therefore, is on self-image and on the pleasure in hating. When our ads show a bigot, just like
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:37.200]   the members of the target audience, being criticized, hated, and shunned, we make use of
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:43.360]   direct emotional modeling as well. Remember, a bigot seeks approval and liking from his crowd.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:48.480]   When he sees someone like himself being disapproved of and disliked by ordinary Joes,
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:53.680]   direct emotional modeling ensures that he will feel just what they feel and transfer it to himself.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:58:00.480]   This wrinkle effectively elicits shame and doubt, jamming any pleasure he might normally feel.
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:04.960]   In a very real sense, every time a bigot sees such things, he is unlearning a little bit of
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:10.800]   the lessons of prejudice taught him by his parents and peers. Effective jamming is achieved without
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:18.800]   reference to facts, logic, or proof. Through repeated infrological emotional conditioning,
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:25.040]   his bigotry can be alloyed in exactly the same way, whether he is conscious of the attack or not.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:30.240]   Indeed, the more he is distracted by any incidental, even specious, surface arguments,
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:34.560]   the less conscious he'll be of the true nature of the process, which is all to the good.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.520]   I'm going to read that paragraph again because it's important that you understand this,
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:44.960]   especially as related to financial topics. "The effective jamming is achieved without
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:51.600]   reference to facts, logic, or proof. Through repeated infrological emotional conditioning,
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:57.520]   his bigotry can be alloyed in exactly the same way, whether he is conscious of the attack or not.
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:03.680]   Indeed, the more he is distracted by any incidental, even specious, surface arguments,
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:10.000]   the less conscious he'll be of the true nature of the process, which is all to the good. In short,
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   jamming succeeds insofar as it inserts even a slight frision of doubt and shame into the
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:23.360]   previously unalloyed self-righteous pleasure. You need massive public exposure of the message
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:29.040]   to succeed." And then stage three, the first stage was desensitization. Stage two is jamming,
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:34.640]   and stage three here is conversion. "Desensitization aims at lowering the intensity of
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:40.720]   anti-homosexual emotional reactions to a level approximating sheer indifference. Jamming attempts
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:47.200]   to blockade or counteract the rewarding 'pride and prejudice' by attaching to homo-hatred a
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:53.120]   pre-existing and punishing sense of shame in being a bigot, a horse's ass, and a beater and
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:59.280]   murderer. Both of these techniques are preludes to our highest, though necessarily very long-range
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:06.320]   goal, which is conversion. Conversion of the average American's emotions, mind, and will
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:12.400]   through a planned psychological attack in the form of propaganda fed to the nation via the media.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.280]   We mean subverting the mechanism of prejudice to our own ends, using the very process that made
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:25.040]   America hate us to turn their hatred into warm regard, whether they like it or not.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:30.560]   If desensitization lets the watch run down and jamming throws sand in the works,
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:37.360]   conversion reverses the spring so that the hands run backward. In conversion, the bigot who holds
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:43.520]   a very negative stereotypic picture is repeatedly exposed to literal picture and label pairs
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:49.040]   in magazines and on billboards and TV of homosexuals, explicitly labeled as such,
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.080]   who not only don't look like his picture of homosexuals, but are carefully selected to look
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:59.360]   either like the bigot and his friends or like any of his other stereotypes of all right guys,
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:05.680]   the kind of people he already likes and admires. This image must, of necessity, be carefully
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:11.920]   tailored to be free of absolutely every element of the widely held stereotypes of how faggots look,
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:18.720]   dress, and sound. He or she must not be too well or fashionably dressed, must not be too handsome,
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:25.760]   that is, mustn't look like a model or well-groomed. The image must be that of an icon or normality.
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:30.800]   A good beginning would be to take a long look at Coors Beer and Three Musketeers candy commercials.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:36.720]   Subsequent ads can branch out from that solid basis to include really adorable athletic teenagers,
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:43.360]   kindly grandmothers, avuncular policemen ad infinitum. But it makes no difference that the
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:52.080]   ads are lies, not to us, because we're using them to ethically good effect, to counter negative
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:59.520]   stereotypes that are every bit as much lies and far more wicked ones, not be bigots, because the
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:05.520]   ads will have their effect on them whether they believe them or not. I need to read that paragraph
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:12.800]   again to emphasize it. But it makes no difference that the ads are lies, not to us, because we're
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:18.400]   using them to ethically good effect, to counter negative stereotypes that are every bit as much
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:24.400]   lies and far more wicked ones, not be bigots, because the ads will have their effect on them
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:29.840]   whether they believe them or not. When a bigot is presented with an image of the sort of person of
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:36.080]   whom he already has a positive stereotype, he experiences an involuntary rush of positive
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:42.640]   emotion, of good feeling. He's been conditioned to experience it. But here the good picture has
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:47.760]   the bad label, homosexual. The ad may say something rather like "Buregaard Smith,
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:53.120]   beer drinker, good old boy, pillar of the community, 100% American, and homosexual as a
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:03:00.240]   mongoose." The bigot will feel two incompatible emotions, a good response to the picture, a bad
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:06.160]   response to the label. At worst, the two will cancel one another, and we will have successfully
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:13.920]   jammed as above. At best, associative conditioning will, to however small an extent, transfer the
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:19.120]   positive emotion associated with the picture to the label itself, not immediately replacing the
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:25.120]   negative response, but definitely weakening it. You may wonder why the transfer wouldn't proceed
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.720]   in the opposite direction. The reason is simple. Pictures are stronger than words and evoke
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:36.560]   emotional responses more powerfully. The bigot is presented with an actual picture. Its label will
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:41.760]   evoke in his mind his own stereotypic picture. What he sees in his mind's eye will be weaker
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.560]   than what he actually sees in front of him with the eyes in his face. The more carefully selected
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:52.480]   the advertising image is to reflect his ideal of the sort of person who just couldn't be homosexual,
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.840]   the more effective it will be. Moreover, he will, by virtue of logical necessity,
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.720]   see the positive picture in the ad before it can arouse his negative picture, and first
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:09.440]   impressions have an advantage over second. In conversion, we mimic the natural process
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:15.600]   of stereotype learning with the following effect. We take the bigot's good feelings about all right
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:22.000]   guys and attach them to the label "gay," either weakening or eventually replacing his bad feelings
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.160]   toward the label and the prior stereotype. Understanding direct emotional modeling,
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:33.840]   you'll readily foresee its application to conversion. Whereas in jamming, the target is
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:40.400]   shown a bigot being rejected by his crowd for his prejudice against homosexuals, in conversion,
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:45.120]   the target is shown his crowd actually associating with homosexuals in good fellowship.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:51.760]   Once again, it's very difficult for the average person, who by nature and training almost
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:58.320]   invariably feels what he sees his fellows feeling, not to respond in this knee-jerk fashion to a
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:04.640]   sufficiently calculated advertisement. In a way, most advertisement is founded upon an answer of
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:09.680]   "yes, definitely." To Mother's sarcastic question, I suppose if all the other kids jumped off a
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:17.680]   bridge and killed themselves, you would too? Success depends on flooding the media, and that
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:26.320]   in turn means money, man hours, and unifying the homosexual community for a concerted effort.
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:32.960]   Pay attention to this section here. Learn from Madison Avenue to roll out the big guns.
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:38.400]   Homosexuals must launch a large-scale campaign. We've called it the "waging peace campaign" to
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:45.200]   reach straights through the mainstream media. We're talking about propaganda. The term propaganda
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:49.840]   applies to any deliberate attempt to persuade the masses via public communications media.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:57.360]   Its function is not to perpetrate, but to propagate. To propagate, that is, to spread
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:03.840]   new ideas and feelings or reinforce old ones, which may themselves be either evil or good
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:09.040]   depending on their purpose and effect. The purpose and effect of pro-gay propaganda
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:12.880]   is to promote a climate of increased tolerance for homosexuals.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:20.480]   Three characteristics distinguish propaganda from other modes of communication and contribute to its
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:29.920]   sinister reputation. 1. Relies on emotional manipulation through desensitization, jamming,
[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:40.960]   and conversion. 2. Use lies. And 3. Subjective and one-sided. Tell our side of the story as
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:46.160]   movingly as possible. In the battle for hearts and minds, effective propaganda knows enough to
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:54.720]   put its best foot forward. This is what our own media campaign must do. We must train leaders,
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:00.560]   national workshops for full acceptance in America, begin a national positive images campaign.
[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:08.240]   Recognition is dawning that anti-gay discrimination begins, like war, in the minds of men and must be
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:13.840]   stopped there with the help of propaganda. The principal goal of the campaign is to gain
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:19.520]   tolerance and acceptance by the straight community. Show in the media that homosexual community lives
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:27.520]   by an ethical code in order to achieve our goal of tolerance and acceptance. Publicly come out to
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:34.640]   desensitize, jam, and convert straight America. Jamming means interrupting the smooth workings of
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:41.840]   bigotry by inducing inconsistent feelings in the bigot. Extreme bigots become less confident that
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:47.360]   their incitements will generate applause and are further inhibited by the majority of mild bigots,
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:51.040]   who now become uneasy that a fagslur might provoke an unpleasant scene.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.800]   Once these dynamics get going, displays of homo hatred suddenly become off color and boorish.
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:01.840]   Thus, when homosexuals come out, they help transform the social climate from one that
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:08.080]   supports prejudice to one that shuts homo haters up. Coming out is critical catalyst for the all
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:14.240]   important conversion process. To make straights actually like and accept homosexuals as a group,
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:20.000]   enabling straights to identify with them, coming out is the key to sociopolitical empowerment,
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.520]   the ability of the gay community to control its own destiny.
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:29.040]   The coming out process is too slow, so we also need a national media campaign.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:34.560]   After meeting enough likable homosexuals on TV, Jane Doe may begin to feel she knows homosexuals
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:39.920]   as a group, even if none has ever introduced himself to her personally. Thwart bigotry.
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:47.040]   Carefully crafted, repeatedly displayed mass media images of homosexuals could conceivably
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:51.760]   do even more to reverse negative stereotypes than could the incremental coming out of one
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:58.160]   person to another. The wide range of favorably sanitized images that might be shown in the media
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:04.000]   could eventually have a far more positive impact on the homosexual stereotype than could exposure
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.040]   to homosexual friends. Since straights will otherwise generalize a suboptimal impression
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:13.840]   of gays from the idiosyncratic admixture of good and bad traits possessed by their one or two
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.440]   homosexual acquaintances. Portray only the most favorable side of gays, thereby counterbalancing
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:25.440]   the already unfairly negative stereotype in the public's mind. The media campaign will work well
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:30.640]   in tandem with the everyone comes out strategy because it is actually a catalyst to coming out.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:35.440]   And the final, well, excuse me, the final part of this section here.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.200]   There are two different avenues to gay liberation. Education, i.e. propaganda, and politics.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:47.600]   Politicians must be responsive to public sentiment on sensational issues if they value their careers.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:52.880]   But this often happens in politics, especially on the homosexual issue where, as Yeasts would say,
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.120]   "The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity."
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:03.040]   Our political success would be greatly advanced by media campaign conducted prior to
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:09.840]   or simultaneously with political initiatives. And then I'm skipping a section here and I've
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.720]   got one more page here of skipping to a different principle. And again, if you'd like to read these
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:22.480]   notes, what I'm trying to point out to you is how there can be a concerted propaganda pressure
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:28.240]   to adjust public sentiment and public opinion. And this will apply directly to many financial topics.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:34.320]   But here are a couple of additional things. So from page 12 of these notes, which are pulling
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:40.640]   from pages, page 178 of After the Ball, is under a principle called keep talking where you need to
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:45.840]   keep discussing all of these issues continually until people get desensitized to them.
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:52.240]   Quote, "In the early stages of the campaign, the public should not be shocked and repelled
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:58.640]   by premature exposure to homosexual behavior itself. Instead, the imagery of sex per se should
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.960]   be downplayed and the issue of gay rights reduced as far as possible to an abstract social question."
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:10.960]   Close quote. That was from page 178. Quote, "As it happens, the AIDS epidemic, ever a course and
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:15.840]   boon for the gay movement, provides ample opportunity to emphasize the civil rights
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:19.920]   and discrimination side of things. But unfortunately, it also permits our enemies to
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:25.360]   draw attention to gay sex habits that provoke revulsion." Close quote from page 178.
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:31.520]   Accused religious people, quote, "Gays can use talk to muddy the moral waters, that is,
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:37.760]   to undercut the rationalizations that justify religious bigotry and to jam some of its psychic
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:43.840]   rewards. Portray such institutions as antiquated backwaters, badly out of step with the times and
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:51.520]   with the latest findings of psychology." It's from page 179. Finally, some quotes from the
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:57.120]   author's principle five, which is to portray gays as victims, not as aggressive challengers. Quote,
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:01.680]   "Gays must be portrayed as victims in need of protection. So the straights will be inclined
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.880]   by reflex to adopt the role of protector. If gays present themselves instead as a strong
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:11.520]   and arrogant tribe promoting a defiantly nonconformist lifestyle, they are most likely
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:16.160]   to be seen as a public menace that warrants resistance and oppression." From page 183.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:22.880]   Key point, quote, "The purpose of victim imagery is to make straights feel very uncomfortable.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.520]   That is to jam with shame the self-righteous pride that would ordinarily accompany and reward
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:32.160]   their anti-gay belligerence and to lay the groundwork for the process of conversion by
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.280]   helping straights identify with gays and sympathize with their underdog status." Close quote from page
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:43.120]   183. Quote, "Persons featured in media campaigns should be wholesome and admirable by straight
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.000]   standards and completely unexceptional in appearance. In a word, they should be indistinguishable from
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.920]   the straights we'd like to reach." Close quote, 183. Quote, "Conventional young people, middle-aged
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:58.320]   women, and older folks of all races would be featured, not to mention the parents and straight
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:03.040]   friends of gays. One could also argue that lesbians should be featured more prominently
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.840]   than gay men in the early stages of the media campaign." Close quote from 183 to 184.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:13.360]   Finally here, two different messages about gay victims. The public persuaded that gays are
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.560]   victims of circumstance, that they no more choose their sexual orientation than they did, say,
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:24.720]   their height, skin color, talents, or limitations. Quote, "To suggest in public that homosexuality
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:30.880]   might be chosen is to open the can of worms labeled 'moral choice' and 'sin' and give the
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:37.600]   religious intransigence a stick to beat us with. Straights must be taught that it is as natural for
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:44.080]   some persons to be homosexual as it is for others to be heterosexual. Wickedness and seduction have
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.360]   nothing to do with it, and since no choice is involved, gayness can be no more blameworthy than
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:55.840]   straightness. In fact, it is simply a matter of the odds, one in ten, as to who turns out gay and who's
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:01.600]   straight. Each heterosexual must be led to realize that he might easily have been born homosexual
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:08.720]   himself." Page 184. "Gays should be portrayed as victims of prejudice. Straights don't fully
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:14.880]   realize the suffering they bring upon gays and must be shown graphic pictures of brutalized gays,
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:23.280]   dramatizations of job and housing insecurity, loss of child custody, public humiliation, etc." Page 184.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:28.400]   Finally, this section, "Help straights become homosexual protectors, play for sympathy and
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:34.000]   tolerance, march if you must, but don't parade. Look good for the camera and newspaper. Look
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.040]   ordinary, not disenfranchised drag queens, bull dykes, exotic elements of the gay community.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:48.400]   Desensitization works gradually or not at all." Page 186. If you look at that content and you
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:58.240]   clearly understand the tools and methodologies used, and you use that combined with some study
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:03.440]   of logic and logical fallacies, and then you start looking at the world around you,
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:09.600]   I believe you'll be able to see through a lot of the propaganda because propaganda is not only used
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:16.320]   in the furtherance of the homosexual movement. It's used in every area of life. It's used in tons
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:24.080]   and tons of aspects of finance. And we're going to get into many more of those aspects in future
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:32.240]   episodes. The challenge is simply that I sometimes struggle with knowing how to work through things.
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:37.040]   I find information, some of which I brought on the show and some of which I'll bring in the
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.800]   future, but I find information and you struggle and you say, "Wow, can this be true? Is this true?
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:48.320]   How does this work?" The biggest, probably the most immediately apparent one where I've connected
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:53.520]   this with actual financial topics is the discussion of retirement. Well, that makes a big difference
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:01.680]   in your life, how you view retirement planning. It makes a big difference. So it's difficult and
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.400]   challenging to work through this with the financial aspects because most of this stuff goes far beyond
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:13.120]   my lifetime, probably far beyond your lifetime. But we, as a radical personal finance community,
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:18.480]   we need to continue to develop our critical thinking skills. And we need to continually
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:26.560]   develop our knowledge and our research skills. And we need to look at the society around us and
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:33.360]   hone our skills of discernment to understand what's actually happening in society around us.
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:40.320]   When I finally was able to look at those documents that I just read to you in detail,
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:46.880]   and I was able to understand the tools and the tactics presented by Kirk and Madsen on
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:55.840]   how they planned, brilliantly planned to achieve their objective. And then I thought back over the
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:00.000]   course of my lifetime and I thought through all the different things that I've been exposed to,
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:06.720]   TV programs, the debates, the social commentary, the newspaper articles, the personal conversations.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:12.480]   I just thought, I can see every single one of their tactics applied to modern society.
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:19.600]   And it has led to an almost absolute complete transformation of modern society.
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:24.560]   It's incredible. It's incredible the power of propaganda techniques.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:28.720]   Now, those techniques can be used and employed for good or for bad.
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:34.400]   And your perspective on good and bad will be driven by your worldview,
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:40.560]   which is why you need to spend a lot of time thinking about it and constructing it. It's
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:48.080]   very easy to see these techniques in modern social issues. I'll give you an example. Take the
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:56.240]   discussion very clearly presented by Kirk and Madsen on leading with the camel's nose,
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:03.840]   just leading with the simple camel's nose. Look at a modern social issue that is constantly in
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:11.840]   the forefront of societal debate, for example, abortion. So in our modern, in 2015, the battle
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:17.280]   in our society in general is over abortion in general. So we're at the stage in the discussion
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:22.320]   where we publicly argue about the ethics of killing a preborn baby, but we argue about it
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:28.000]   whether or not it's right because it's conceived because of rape or incest. We don't really argue
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.520]   about the uglier side of abortion, which is the concept of, "This baby is simply inconvenient to
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:39.440]   me," abortions. We don't argue about the possibility of sex-selective abortion, like is somewhat common
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:43.760]   in China as a result of their one-child policy. We don't know about the fact that in China,
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:49.200]   there are unmarked vans with sonograph equipment to offer illegal gender identification ultrasounds
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:53.840]   to pregnant mothers so they can determine the gender of their baby prior to birth.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:58.240]   We certainly don't talk about disability-selective abortion. We don't talk about the fact that
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.200]   90% of the babies that are diagnosed with Down syndrome via fetal genetic testing are ultimately
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:07.680]   aborted and killed. It's not polite to bring that up in our society. It's too graphic, too grating.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:14.560]   It's not a polite conversation. We certainly would never talk about the massive disparity
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:19.920]   in race among abortion. We wouldn't talk about the massive number of black babies that are
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:25.360]   aborted. In a culture of featuring the hashtag of #BlackLivesMatter,
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:33.040]   we talk about police brutality, and we should, but we don't dare talk about the fact that the
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:37.760]   number one killer of black lives in the United States is abortion. It's fascinating. If you
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:42.480]   total up all the causes of death for blacks in the United States for HIV, homicide, diabetes,
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:49.360]   accidents, cancer, and heart disease, you wind up with 285,522 annual deaths. In the meantime,
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:20:00.160]   363,000, almost 80,000 more, 360,000 more babies, excuse me, 363,000 total babies were aborted.
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:07.280]   That's a worldview issue. So you got to think about and understand your worldview and your
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:11.440]   ethical framework, and you need to effectively articulate it for yourself, for your family,
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:17.600]   and for your community. Neutrality is not an option. You cannot be neutral on it.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:25.360]   On a situation like that, most people, the lie of the abortion propaganda is that you can be neutral.
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:33.200]   And this is where we go back to the topic of cowardice. I have a very difficult time
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:38.880]   having effective conversations with people who are vaguely religious and with people who are
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:45.120]   vaguely humanist. I personally prefer you to understand your worldview clearly and advocate
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:50.080]   confidently for your positions. Now, obviously, we're all in the process of assembling and
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.640]   disassembling and repairing and adjusting and modifying our respective worldviews. No matter
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:58.560]   where you are as a person in your life's development, you're effectively constantly
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.440]   adjusting to new information, new content, new learning. I get that. That's the whole point of
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:10.240]   why I'm trying to do this show, to help you and give you information so that you can understand
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:16.880]   what you believe and why. But in order to do that, somebody needs to be clear about what they believe
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:24.480]   and why. I'm not scared of a good debate. I hope you aren't either. A good debate is useful, but
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:29.040]   we can't lie to each other about what our positions are and have an effective debate.
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:36.960]   And that's what makes me so angry about much of modern-day propaganda. And this show – I'm
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:42.080]   hoping that I'm clear with my content here. This show is not about finance. This show is about
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:49.040]   propaganda and worldview and systems and codes of morality and ethics. And then for the forthcoming
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:53.840]   future of this show, we're going to apply it to financial topics. But you need this background of
[02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:59.040]   how do we think about worldview. The debate is important as long as we effectively articulate
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:04.800]   our position and our framework and our worldview, and as long as we're consistent with it.
[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:10.640]   Let me give you an example. Let me tell you about a man that I admire. The man is named Peter Singer.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:15.360]   Now, the reason that I admire him is simply because he's not a coward
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:23.680]   and he's intellectually consistent. I can hardly imagine somebody who is farther away from me
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:29.280]   on a continuum of issues, especially social issues. But at least he's consistent with his
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:34.480]   own philosophy. So that way I can actually understand and articulate his philosophy.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:40.640]   He says what he believes. He doesn't hide behind ridiculous propaganda marketing messages. He says
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:46.240]   what he believes so that I can actually think about that and say, "Hmm, do I believe what he says?
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:51.840]   Do I believe what I say? Or do I believe somewhere in the middle?" And I can wrestle with my worldview
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:56.720]   and I can wrestle with my issues. Let me give you some examples from his Wikipedia article.
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:03.280]   So this is from Wikipedia. "Peter Albert David Singer, born 6th of July 1946, is an Australian
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:09.600]   moral philosopher. He is currently the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:14.880]   and a Laureate Professor at the Center for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:20.080]   University of Melbourne. He specializes in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:26.000]   secular utilitarian perspective." Interestingly, he's not a secular humanist. He's a secular
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.920]   utilitarian. I'll clarify that in a moment, but to continue on, he's close enough for the discussion
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:36.400]   for right now. "He is known in particular for his book Animal Liberation, 1975, a canonical text in
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:42.080]   animal rights and liberation theory. For most of his career, he supported preference utilitarianism,
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:47.200]   but in his later years became a classical or hedonistic utilitarian when co-authoring
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:52.880]   The Point of View of the Universe with Catarzyna de Lazari-Radek. On two occasions, Singer served
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:57.920]   as Chair of the Philosophy Department at Monash University, where he founded its Center for Human
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:04.080]   Bioethics. In 1996, he stood unsuccessfully as a Greens candidate for the Australian Senate.
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:09.360]   In 2004, he was recognized as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:14.640]   Humanist Societies, and in June 2012 was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:20.400]   services to philosophy and bioethics. He serves on the Advisory Board of Incentives for Global Health,
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.760]   the NGO formed to develop the Health Impact Fund proposal. He has voted one of Australia's 10 most
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:31.760]   influential public intellectuals in 2006. Singer currently serves on the Advisory Board of Academic
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:35.760]   Stand Against Poverty." We'll get to that in a moment. Now, let's talk about some of his ideas.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:41.200]   This is important, and here's a man who's not a coward, who's actually consistent with his
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:46.160]   philosophy, consistent with his moral, ethical, and intellectual framework, and applies it. Here
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.680]   are some of his positions directly from his Wikipedia page. Applied Ethics. "Singer's most
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:57.680]   comprehensive work, Practical Ethics, from 1979, analyzes in detail why and how living beings'
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:02.960]   interests should be weighed. His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:08.720]   equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment.
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:12.880]   All have an interest in avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few have an interest
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:17.760]   in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:21.920]   different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when diminishing
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:27.120]   marginal utility is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person's
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.200]   interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry.
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.400]   Among the more important human interests are those in avoiding pain, in developing one's
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:42.880]   abilities, in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, in enjoying warm, personal relationships,
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.720]   in being free to pursue one's projects without interference and many others.
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:53.360]   The fundamental interest that entitles a being to equal consideration is the capacity for suffering
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:58.800]   and/or enjoyment or happiness." That's important. "Singer holds that a being's interest should
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.720]   always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties. He favors a journey model
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:10.800]   of life, which measures the wrongness of taking a life by the degree to which doing so frustrates a
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:17.920]   life journey's goals. The journey model is tolerant of some frustrated desire and explains why persons
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:23.200]   who have embarked on their journeys are not replaceable. Only a personal interest in continuing
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:29.200]   to live brings the journey model into play. This model also explains the priority that Singer
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:35.440]   attaches to interests over trivial desires and pleasures. Singer's ideas require the concept of
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:39.920]   an impartial standpoint from which to compare interests. He has wavered about whether the
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:45.200]   precise aim is the total amount of satisfied interests or the most satisfied interests
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:51.120]   among those beings who already exist prior to the decision making. The second edition of Practical
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:55.440]   Ethics disavows the first edition's suggestion that the total and prior existence views should
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.800]   be combined. The second edition asserts that the preference satisfaction utilitarianism
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:06.320]   incorporating the journey model applies without invoking the first edition's suggestions about
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:11.360]   the total view. The details are fuzzy, however, and Singer admits that he is not entirely satisfied
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:19.040]   with his treatment. Ethical conduct is justifiable by reasons that go beyond prudence to something
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:25.760]   bigger than the individual, addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going beyond identifies
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:33.600]   moral reasons as somehow universal, specifically in the adjunction to "love thy neighbor as thyself"
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:39.600]   interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:46.240]   gives to one's own interests. This universalizing step, which Singer traces from Kant to Hare,
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:51.680]   is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists from Hobbes to David Gauthier
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:58.000]   who tie morality to prudence. Universalization leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues,
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.800]   on the strength of the thought that one's own interests cannot count for more than the interests
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:08.640]   of others. Taking these into account, one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:14.640]   is most likely to maximize the interests of those affected. Utilitarianism has been arrived at.
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:20.160]   Singer's universalizing step applies to interests without reference to who has them,
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:25.520]   whereas a Kantian's applies to the judgments of rational agents in Kant's Kingdom of Ends,
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:31.600]   or Rawls' original position, etc. Singer regards Kantian universalization as unjust to animals.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:37.040]   As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of Practical Ethics,
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.200]   arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:47.200]   the paradox of hedonism, which counts—okay, I'm going to quit now. So the point is that here is
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:53.840]   Peter Singer, and he's saying, "Here is my worldview." He's not a secular humanist,
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:57.360]   but he's close enough. I'll cover that in a moment. "Here's my worldview, and here's its
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:05.120]   application, and it's clear and it's consistent. You should think about it and see if you agree
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:11.600]   with it. I don't, but you should." Now, remember I just talked about abortion, and I said,
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:18.320]   "Speak clearly on the issue." The problem is that we in our modern era are engaged in a constant
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:23.760]   war of propaganda for minds, and we've been so crippled by our inability to actually think
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:29.520]   and to think critically about the underlying worldviews and philosophies
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:34.720]   that we argue about whether or not we should abort babies that are due to incest and rape.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:40.560]   Instead of talking about abortion as a moral agreement. So here is Singer's position on
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:45.600]   abortion. In Singer's view, the central argument against abortion may be stated as the following
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:51.440]   syllogism. "It is wrong to kill an innocent human being. A human fetus is an innocent human being.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:56.400]   Therefore, it is wrong to kill a human fetus." In his book, "Rethinking Life and Death," as well as
[02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:01.600]   in "Practical Ethics," Singer asserts that if we take the premises at face value, the argument is
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:07.360]   deductively valid. Singer comments that defenders of abortion attack the second premise, suggesting
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:13.280]   that the fetus becomes a human or alive at some point after conception. However, Singer finds this
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:18.480]   argument flawed in that human development is a gradual process, and it is nearly impossible to
[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:23.920]   mark a particular moment in time as the moment at which life begins. Singer's argument for abortion
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:28.560]   differs from many other proponents of abortion, then, rather than attacking the second premise
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:34.080]   of the anti-abortion argument, Singer attacks the first premise, denying that it is necessarily wrong
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:40.560]   to take innocent human life. Notice that. Denying that it is necessarily wrong to take innocent
[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:47.200]   human life. The argument that a fetus is not alive is a resort to a convenient fiction that turns an
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:52.720]   evidently living being into one that legally is not alive. Instead of accepting such fictions,
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:58.320]   we should recognize that the fact that a being is human and alive does not in itself tell us
[02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:03.600]   whether it is wrong to take that being's life. Singer states that arguments for or against
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:10.560]   abortion should be based on utilitarian calculation, which compares the preferences of a woman against
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:16.320]   the preferences of the fetus. In his view, a preference is anything sought to be obtained
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:22.640]   or avoided. All forms of benefit or harm caused to a being correspond directly with the satisfaction
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:27.920]   or frustration of one or more of its preferences. Since the capacity to achieve the sensations of
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:33.120]   suffering or satisfaction is a prerequisite to having any preferences at all, add a fetus
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:38.720]   up to around 18 weeks, says Singer, who has no capacity to suffer or feel satisfaction.
[02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:44.080]   It is not possible for such a fetus to hold any preferences at all. In a utilitarian calculation,
[02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:48.640]   there is nothing to weigh against a woman's preferences to have an abortion. Therefore,
[02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:55.200]   abortion is morally permissible. Singer's book, Rethinking Life or Death, The Collapse of Our
[02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:59.200]   Traditional Ethics, offer further examination of the ethical dilemmas concerning the advances of
[02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:03.520]   medicine. He covers the value of human life and the quality of life ethics in addition to abortion
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:10.320]   and other controversial ethical questions. So do you see why this is important? I believe that
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:16.880]   argument is a valid argument between, as an example, the biblical Christian worldview
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:22.960]   and the secular humanist worldview. That's a consistent argument. His preference utilitarian
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:29.280]   argument makes far more sense than arguing over rape and incest. But that doesn't work in popular
[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:35.360]   society. So we have to engage in propaganda instead of actually arguing the reality of it.
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:43.760]   This is why in 2012, in the Journal of Medical Ethics, a philosopher and a bioethicist jointly
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:50.640]   proposed that infanticide be legalized, calling it after-birth abortion and claiming that both
[02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:57.040]   the fetus and the newborn are potential persons. That's also from a separate Wikipedia article on
[02:32:57.040 --> 02:33:03.520]   infanticide. That would be consistent with a different worldview. There's nothing magical
[02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:11.440]   that happens at birth as far as the baby, except the first breath. But a baby that's prior to birth
[02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:14.800]   and a baby that's at birth, they're practically the same thing. They just haven't come out.
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:20.000]   So you have all these arguments in the United States that are based upon these different
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:25.680]   worldviews, but very few people are clear about it. Let's talk about euthanasia and let's hear
[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:30.240]   what Singer says on this, euthanasia and infanticide. Consistent with his general ethical
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:34.960]   theory, Singer holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being's capacity to hold
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:40.320]   preferences, which in turn is essentially tied to a being's capacity to feel pain and pleasure.
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:45.600]   Similar to his argument for abortion, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:51.680]   characteristics of personhood, rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness, and therefore
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:56.160]   killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person. That is a being who wants to
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:01.600]   go on living. Let's talk about a couple other social issues and then we're going to get into
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:06.960]   how this applies to world poverty, because we can apply exactly the same mindset and philosophy
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:14.640]   to something like world poverty. Speciesism. Published in 1975, Animal Liberation has been
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:19.200]   cited as a formative influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement.
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:24.240]   The central argument of the book is an expansion of the utilitarian idea that the greatest good
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.840]   or the greatest number is the only measure of good or ethical behavior. Singer believes that
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.880]   there is no reason not to apply this to other animals, arguing that the boundary between human
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:40.880]   and animal is completely arbitrary. There are more differences between a grape ape, great ape,
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:46.080]   and an oyster, for example, than between a human and a great ape, and yet the former two are lumped
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:51.840]   together as animals whilst we are human. In particular, he argues that while animals show
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:56.720]   lower intelligence than the average human, many severely intellectually challenged humans show
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.840]   equally diminished, if not lower, mental capacity, and that some animals have displayed signs of
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.960]   intelligence sometimes on par with that of human children. Singer therefore argues intelligence
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:11.520]   does not provide a basis for providing non-human animals any less consideration than such
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:18.160]   intellectually challenged humans. He popularized the term speciesism. That is a consistent
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:24.320]   worldview. If you believe that human beings are the result of accidental biological process,
[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:36.720]   then speciesism is a rational social justice issue for you to argue for. As much as racism and ageism
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:43.120]   and bigotry, you should be arguing for speciesism. Have you ever thought about that?
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:50.080]   Now, obviously, I don't expect any of you to agree with Peter Singer. There's always people
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:55.360]   in every movement with whom we all disagree. I could sit and argue with tons of Christian
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:36:00.240]   theologians left and right, but I'm saying, have you thought your worldview through?
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:08.720]   His worldview is fairly extreme, but I think it's consistent. He goes on and talks about personism,
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:16.160]   and that's what he prefers over and above the concept of secular humanism. What about something
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:22.720]   like bestiality, sex between humans and animals? In a 2001 review of Midas Decker's Dearest Pet
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:28.240]   on bestiality, Singer argues that sexual activities between humans and animals that result in harm to
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:34.480]   the animal should remain illegal, but that "sex with animals does not always involve cruelty"
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:41.200]   and that "mutually satisfying activities" of a sexual nature may sometimes occur between humans
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:48.480]   and animals, and that writer Otto Sojka would condone such activities. That's a consistent
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:53.920]   scenario because if you believe in evolutionary biology and you believe that human beings are only
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:37:00.320]   just slightly more of farther along in their evolutionary stage than animals, then why would
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:05.600]   you be repulsed by the idea of bestiality? Why is it illegal in all 50 United States? I think it's
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:11.920]   illegal in all 50 United States. Why is it illegal at all? That's an important worldview issue for you
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:15.920]   to think about. Don't just skip past it because you're unfamiliar with it. I'm not arguing for
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:22.640]   the extreme. I'm illustrating a consistent application of a worldview. Now, let's apply
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:28.640]   this to financial issues. What would Singer's response be to world poverty? Because remember,
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:36.880]   you and I are involved in this. If you're a US American taxpayer, the US government takes some
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:42.560]   amount of your money and sends it overseas to fight world poverty. The US government takes some
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:47.600]   amount of your money and sends it back into our society to deal with US-based poverty.
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:53.920]   How would Singer discuss this? Well, in Famine, Affluence, and Morality, one of Singer's best-known
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:59.920]   philosophical essays, he argues that some people living in abundance while others starve is morally
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:06.240]   indefensible. Singer proposes that anyone able to help the poor should donate part of their income
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:13.600]   to aid poverty relief and similar efforts. Singer reasons that when one is already living comfortably,
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:18.480]   a further purchase to increase comfort will lack the same moral importance as saving another
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:25.120]   person's life. Singer himself reports that he donates around 33% of his salary to a variety
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:31.120]   of cost-effective charities, and he is a member of Giving What We Can, an international society for
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:37.040]   the promotion of poverty relief inspired by Singer's arguments. In Rich and Poor, the version
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:41.760]   of the aforementioned article that appears in the second edition of Practical Ethics, his main
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:46.960]   argument is presented as follows. "If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:53.200]   of comparable significance, we ought to do it. Absolute poverty is bad. There is some poverty
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:58.560]   we can prevent without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance. Therefore,
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:04.720]   we ought to prevent some absolute poverty." Singer's most recent book, The Life You Can Save,
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:09.520]   makes the argument that it is a clear-cut moral imperative for citizens of developed countries
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.480]   to give more to charitable causes that help the poor. While Singer acknowledges that there are
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:19.280]   problems with ensuring that money goes where it is most needed and that it is used effectively,
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:23.840]   he does not think that these practical difficulties undermine his original conclusion,
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:26.560]   that people should make a much greater effort to reduce poverty.
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:37.200]   Now, to wrap this up, oh, one more important back on the social aspect that I want to comment on,
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:41.760]   and then we'll be wrapped up. But obviously, Singer's just one person. He doesn't, again,
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:46.480]   he doesn't speak for the majority of secular humanists any more than the Westboro Baptist
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:51.840]   Church or the Pope speak for Christians. Every sociological grouping has factions.
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:57.840]   Now, interestingly, I promised to mention, he doesn't actually call himself a secular humanist.
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:01.040]   From Wikipedia, "Although he has expressed admiration for many of the values promoted by
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:06.000]   secular humanism, Singer believes to be incomplete and promotes a preference utilitarian view he
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:11.200]   calls personism instead." So I won't go into preference utilitarianism or personism any
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.400]   further. But feel free to spend some time on Wikipedia and you should be able to easily
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:20.720]   understand them. My point with all of this is that you need to watch carefully the transitions in
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:26.400]   society because they will affect you. And my reason for going into in depth the background
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:32.160]   of the homosexual movement is so that you can understand the tools and tactics and strategies
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:40.480]   that were part of that movement and apply them and watch them being applied to other social and
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:46.960]   financial movements and political movements. I want to read you one more essay that was quite
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:53.840]   in the news back in October 2014 in the New York Times. I'm reading these things to you. I hope you
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.440]   can at least appreciate whether you agree with my perspective or not. I hope you can at least
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:04.720]   appreciate that I'm trying to present these to you as comprehensive pieces of evidence that stand
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:12.320]   on their own. I'm not necessarily trying to make a commentary on them. I am commenting on them,
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:16.800]   but I'm not trying to tear them apart necessarily. I'm trying to present them to you and allow you
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:21.840]   to consider them. So I hope that's helpful to you. But I want to read you an essay from the New York
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:29.360]   Times. This is relatively short, from October 6, 2014, titled Pedophilia, a Disorder, Not a Crime
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:35.520]   by Margot Kaplan. Think back to your first childhood crush. Maybe it was a classmate or
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.800]   a friend next door. Most likely through school and into adulthood, your affections continue to focus
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:45.840]   on others in your approximate age group. But imagine if they did not. By some estimates,
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:50.400]   1% of the male population continues long after puberty to find themselves attracted to
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:56.400]   prepubescent children. These people are living with pedophilia, a sexual attraction to prepubescence
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:01.040]   that often constitutes a mental illness. Unfortunately, our laws are failing them and
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:06.400]   consequently ignoring opportunities to prevent child abuse. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:11.600]   of Mental Disorders defines pedophilia as an intense and recurrent sexual interest in prepubescent
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:18.320]   children and a disorder if it causes a person "marked distress or interpersonal difficulty"
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:25.040]   or if the person "acts on his interests." Yet our laws ignore pedophilia until after the
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:31.280]   commission of a sexual offense, emphasizing punishment, not prevention. Part of this failure
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:36.640]   stems from the misconception that pedophilia is the same as child molestation. One can live with
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:43.200]   pedophilia and not act on it. Sites like Virtuous Pedophiles provide support for pedophiles who do
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:49.120]   not molest children and believe that sex with children is wrong. It is not that these individuals
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:56.960]   are inactive or non-practicing pedophiles, but rather that pedophilia is a status and not an act.
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:02.560]   In fact, research shows about half of all child molesters are not sexually attracted to their
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:09.680]   victims. A second misconception is that pedophilia is a choice. Recent research, while often limited
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:14.480]   to sex offenders because of the stigma of pedophilia, suggests that the disorder may have
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:20.160]   neurological origins. Pedophilia could result from a failure in the brain to identify which
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:26.320]   environmental stimuli should provoke a sexual response. MRIs of sex offenders with pedophilia
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:31.680]   show fewer of the neural pathways known as white matter in their brains. Men with pedophilia are
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:36.720]   three times more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous, a finding that strongly suggests
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:42.960]   a neurological cause. Some findings also suggest that disturbances in neurodevelopment in utero
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:48.320]   or early childhood increase the risk of pedophilia. Studies have also shown that men
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:54.320]   with pedophilia have, on average, lower scores on tests of visual spatial ability and verbal memory.
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:59.120]   The Virtuous Pedophiles website is full of testimonials of people who vow never to touch a
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:05.200]   child and yet live in terror. They must hide their disorder from everyone they know or risk losing
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:11.120]   educational and job opportunities and face the prospect of harassment and even violence. Many
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:17.360]   feel isolated. Some contemplate suicide. The psychologist Jesse Bering, author of "Perv,
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.640]   the Sexual Deviant in All of Us," writes that people with pedophilia "aren't living their lives
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:28.640]   in the closet. They're eternally hunkered down in a panic room." While treatment cannot eliminate a
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:33.760]   pedophile's sexual interests, a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:39.360]   can help him to manage urges and avoid committing crimes. But the reason we don't know enough about
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:43.280]   effective treatment is because research has usually been limited to those who have committed
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:49.920]   crimes. Our current law is inconsistent and irrational. For example, federal law in 20
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:54.000]   states allow courts to issue a civil order committing a sex offender, particularly one
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:58.880]   with a diagnosis of pedophilia, to a mental health facility immediately after the completion of a
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:03.840]   sentence under standards that are much more lax than for ordinary civil commitment for people
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:07.760]   with mental illness. And yet when it comes to public policies that might help people with
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:12.160]   pedophilia to come forward and seek treatment before they offend, the law omits pedophilia
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:17.760]   from protection. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:22.800]   Act of 1973 prohibit discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with mental
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:28.160]   disabilities in areas such as employment, education, and medical care. Congress, however,
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:33.760]   explicitly excluded pedophilia from protection under these two crucial laws. It's time to revisit
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:38.560]   these categorical exclusions. Without legal protection, a pedophile cannot risk seeking
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:44.720]   treatment or disclosing his status to anyone for support. He could lose his job and future job
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.360]   prospects if he is seen at a group therapy session, asks for a reasonable accommodation
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:54.320]   to take medication or see a psychiatrist, or requests a limit in his interaction with children.
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:58.720]   Isolating individuals from appropriate employment and treatment only increases their risks of
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:03.440]   committing a crime. There is no question that the extension of civil rights protections to
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:08.560]   people with pedophilia must be weighed against the health and safety needs of others, especially
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:12.800]   kids. It stands to reason that a pedophile should not be hired as a grade school teacher.
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:18.960]   Both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act contain exemptions for people who are not otherwise
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:23.920]   qualified for a job or who pose "a direct threat to the health and safety of others" that can't be
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:29.200]   eliminated by a reasonable accommodation. This is why employers don't have to hire blind bus drivers
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:34.480]   or mentally unstable security guards. The direct threat analysis rejects the idea that the employers
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:40.160]   can rely on generalizations. They must assess the specific case and rely on evidence, not
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:44.960]   presuppositions. Those who worry that employers would be compelled to hire dangerous pedophiles
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:49.040]   should look to HIV case law, where for years courts were highly conservative,
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:55.040]   erring on the side of finding a direct threat. Even into the late 1990s, when medical authorities
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:59.760]   were in agreement that people with HIV could work safely in, for example, food services.
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:03.680]   Removing the pedophile exclusion would not undermine criminal justice or its role in
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:08.240]   responding to child abuse. It would not make it easier, for example, for someone accused of child
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:13.680]   molestation to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. A pedophile should be held responsible
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:19.280]   for his conduct, but not for the underlying attraction. Arguing for the rights of scorned
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:23.280]   and misunderstood groups is never popular, particularly when they are associated with
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:29.680]   real harm. But the fact that pedophilia is so despised is precisely why our responses to it
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:35.280]   in criminal justice and mental health have been so inconsistent and counterproductive.
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:39.920]   Acknowledging that pedophiles have a mental disorder and removing the obstacles to their
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:44.880]   coming forward and seeking help is not only the right thing to do, but it would also advance
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:50.080]   efforts to protect children from harm. Margo Kaplan is an assistant professor
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:56.160]   at Rutgers School of Law in Camden, New Jersey. Interesting, huh? So what do you think? Do you
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:02.400]   agree with it? Now, I'll make one point here, and I'll make a couple of points.
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:09.760]   And depending on your worldview, you... Again, I'm grossly generalizing. But depending on your
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:16.960]   worldview, you may see this as, "Finally, it's time to help other people." Or you may see this
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:24.880]   as, "I can't believe it." Me personally, what I notice about it is that this essay makes a big
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:33.920]   difference between sexual attraction and the sexual act. Now, the homosexual movement would
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:41.520]   deny that in their movement, but here Margo talks about personal responsibility. And the only
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:48.560]   commentary I'll give on the question is that, interestingly, Margo Kaplan and I agree. Now,
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:52.560]   I don't know what her perspective is. I don't know if she would agree with the Christian teaching on
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:57.680]   sexual attraction or not. But in the Christian teaching on sexual attraction, sexual attraction
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:05.520]   happens. But you're responsible for your actions. So I have sexual attraction to women other than
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:12.480]   my wife. I am responsible to not act on that attraction. But the key is, the question is,
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:16.400]   you have to look at this, and you have to watch this over coming decades. Is this a discussion,
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:24.560]   and is this kind of just the camel's nose under the tent? Or is this a... And is that what she's
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:32.560]   promoting? Where it's a movement to the interaction of sexual relations with minors? Or what is it?
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:37.280]   You have to deal with it in your worldview. If you're interested, go and you can read the
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:44.160]   North American Man-Boy Love Association website, which vigorously... Which goes much farther than
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.400]   Margo Kaplan does, and vigorously defends the right of minors to have... Minor children,
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:54.320]   especially boys, to have sexual relations with men, adult men. There's nothing new about any
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:58.480]   of this. If you study history, you start to find that all of these issues have been around forever.
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:03.520]   If you study Greek and Roman societies, you find that pederasty was an integral part of their
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:10.720]   society. I'll read you one last thing on this, just on this in case you're not aware, because
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:16.880]   most people have never studied this. But what is pederasty? Okay, from Wikipedia. "Pederasty
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:21.280]   is a usually erotic homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:27.920]   adolescent male. The word pederasty derives from Greek for the love of boys, a compound derived
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:33.760]   from pei, peis, which is child or boy, and erastes, which is lover. In French, however,
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:40.320]   pederasty has been used as a synonym for homosexuality between adult males. Historically,
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:46.000]   pederasty has existed as a variety of customs and practices within different cultures. The status of
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:51.680]   pederasty has changed over the course of history, at times considered an ideal and at other times a
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:56.720]   crime. In the history of Europe, its most structured cultural manifestation was Athenian
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:04.240]   pederasty and became most prominent in the 6th century BC. Greek pederasty's various forms were
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:09.360]   the subject of philosophic debates, in which the purely carnal type was unfavorably compared with
[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:14.160]   erotic friendships and moderate forms. Anthropologists proposed three subdivisions of
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:20.080]   homosexuality as age-structured, egalitarian, and gender-structured. Pederasty is the archetypal
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:25.520]   example of male age-structured homosexuality. Geoffrey Gorer and others distinguished pederasty
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:31.840]   from pedophilia, which he defined as a separate, fourth type that he described as "grossly
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:37.440]   pathological in all societies of which we have record." According to Gorer, the main characteristic
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:42.160]   of homosexual pederasty is the age difference, either of generation or age group between the
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:47.360]   partners. In his study of native cultures, pederasty appears typically as a passing stage in
[02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:52.320]   which the adolescent is the beloved of an older male, remains as such until he reaches a certain
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:57.040]   development threshold, after which he in turn takes on an adolescent beloved of his own.
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:02.320]   This model is judged by Gorer as "socially viable," i.e., not likely to give rise to
[02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:07.600]   psychological discomfort or neuroses for all or most males. He adds that in many societies,
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:12.560]   pederasty has been the main subject of the arts and the main source of tender and elevated emotions.
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:17.600]   Pederastic practices have been utilized for the purpose of coming-of-age rituals,
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:22.480]   the acquisition of virility and manly virtue, education and development of military skill and
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:27.600]   ethics. These were often paralleled by the commercial use of boys for sexual gratification,
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:32.560]   going so far as enslavement and castration. The evanescent beauty of adolescent boys has been a
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:38.320]   topos in poetry and art, from classical times to the Middle East, the Near East and Central Asia,
[02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:43.200]   Imperial China, pre-modern Japan, and the European Renaissance and into modern times.
[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:49.040]   What is the age range? Some modern observers restrict the age of the younger partner to
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:56.240]   "generally between 12 and 17," though historically the spread was somewhat greater.
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:01.680]   The younger partner must, in some sense, not be fully mature. This could include young men
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:06.400]   in their late teens or early twenties. While relationships in ancient Greece involved boys
[02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:12.960]   from 12 to about 17 or 18, in Renaissance Italy they typically involved boys between 14 and 19,
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:17.040]   and in Japan the younger member ranged in age from 11 to about 19.
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:26.480]   I'm done with the social issue commentary. I'm appealing to social issues because they often
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:33.040]   evoke a more emotional response in our hearts and in our minds. I believe that if you've listened
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:38.320]   to this entire thing, you probably have found a number of points of agreement with something I've
[02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:45.920]   said and a number of points of disagreement with something I've said. Why? Why do you agree or
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:54.640]   disagree? You need to understand that and you need to be able to articulate it. You cannot divorce
[02:53:54.640 --> 02:54:03.200]   your worldview from these social issues. If you believe that pederasty was an improper social
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:09.520]   practice, which was practiced throughout much of human history, why? And if you believe that it was
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:18.080]   not, why not? If you articulate your worldview and you can clearly understand it, that worldview will
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:28.000]   have application to almost everything in finance. Here's some things that come to the top of my
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.800]   mind. Should I pay taxes? What's an appropriate rate of taxation or amount of taxation to pay?
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:37.680]   Should it be voluntary or involuntary? What should we do with the tax money? Should we
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:41.680]   subsidize farmers? Should we subsidize certain organizations that have a tax exemption? Should
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:45.920]   we support needy families? Should we support specific companies or industries with the tax
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.320]   money? Do we have a societal obligation to support the poor and provide a guaranteed income, as the
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:55.280]   humanist manifesto number two states? Do we have a societal obligation to take from the rich because
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:00.320]   they have more than is needed for their utilitarian uses, as Peter Singer says? Should we finance
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:04.480]   health insurance the way that we do with Medicaid and Medicare? Should we transition from the system
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:09.360]   that we have in the US government and the US economy from the transition of voluntary, so-called,
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:15.040]   but forced voluntary insurance to a system of corporate insurance? Should we incentivize certain
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.200]   courses of action through the tax code, like saving for retirement or buying houses? How should
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:24.080]   we run a monetary system? Who should be allowed to create monetary? What should be our monetary
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:28.560]   policy and why? What should be our fiscal policy and why? Should there be privacy in your financial
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:32.880]   transactions? Should bankruptcy be permitted? Under what conditions? Who should be permitted
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:37.680]   to discharge their debts? Should certain assets be protected from bankruptcy? Should we confiscate
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:41.680]   the assets of criminals? Should we pay money to keep people in prison for the rest of their life,
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:48.720]   or should we execute all criminals? Or should we have shortened criminal sentences, no execution,
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:52.400]   like they have what was in Denmark, where the guy that killed was a 70-something people and
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:59.200]   the maximum prison sentence is 24 years, I think, something like that? We all have to have and
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:07.120]   develop a coherent, cogent, logical, reasonable, and rational system of thinking. We need a system
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:13.920]   of ethics and morality that can be applied to each question that we face. My own system is incomplete,
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:20.480]   and I dare say yours is too. I'm developing that. But don't listen to my show for what you agree
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:26.320]   with or what you disagree with. Be challenged by what I say and take it back and consider your own
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.520]   thoughts. I'll tell you, and this is not meant to be offensive to those of you who have written
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:37.520]   this to me, but just simply as a point of commentary, I know that this is a social nicety,
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:40.160]   but I'll tell you one of the things that bugs me.
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:45.200]   When people write to me and say, "I don't agree with everything you say,"
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:50.320]   of course you don't agree with everything I say. I probably don't agree with everything I say,
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:55.600]   myself. Sometimes I'll express a thought and then wait to see if it's challenged.
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:00.480]   Now, I don't do that very much on the show here because I don't think that's practical. I try to
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:04.160]   only speak about topics that I feel confident in, that I feel I know something about.
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:10.000]   But I'm not interested in agreement or disagreement. I often talk with my wife or with my
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.800]   friends and share something I'm thinking, and we're looking for a challenge. That's what we
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.200]   need is we need to be challenged. You're welcome to disagree with me. It doesn't bother me a bit.
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:24.960]   I probably disagree with something I said a year ago, because we're all in this process of
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:32.400]   clarifying and formulating a worldview. If you find trouble in disagreeing with me on something,
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:36.400]   ask yourself why, and ask if that isn't a little bit of social conditioning,
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:40.560]   that instead of being taught to educate yourself, which is a process of going and searching for
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:46.240]   things that are true, that you've been schooled, which means you've been told what is true.
[02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:54.720]   I welcome disagreement. It doesn't bother me. I just beg of you one thing. Don't hide behind
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:58:00.880]   cowardice and political popularity. In my opinion, Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen were manipulative
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:07.040]   cowards. They would not say they were. They would say we were doing what was effective.
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:14.320]   But I despise what they did. Now, unfortunately, their worldview allows and permits them to do
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:20.320]   what they did, allows them to hide behind the nose of the camel going under the tent so that
[02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:26.240]   we can get the whole thing under there. I despise that. My worldview doesn't allow me to do that.
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:31.760]   Now, that's a chink in my armor. But if you like listening to the show, it's probably because,
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:35.520]   well, one of the factors, there's no way in the world that someone could listen to what is 180
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:39.440]   episodes of the show like some of you have if you didn't appreciate somebody being clear.
[02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:45.360]   In their worldview, the ends justify the means. In mine, they don't.
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:54.080]   I'll never hide behind unpopular ideas and lie to you about, well, this is unpopular. Truth should
[02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:59.760]   stand on its own. It may be unpopular. But for me, I prefer to be unpopular and stand on the side of
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:05.440]   truth than to be popular and to be a liar. Of course, you're free to choose your own path.
[02:59:07.440 --> 02:59:11.120]   So I'm going to continue over the course of this show to work on exposing and understanding the
[02:59:11.120 --> 02:59:16.800]   ideas that affect finance. Some of these things are very simple. Some of the things are so
[02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:21.280]   incredibly complex that I cannot seem to wrap my head around them. Sometimes you'll hear me say
[02:59:21.280 --> 02:59:25.840]   something I'm very confident in. Sometimes you'll hear me say something that I'm still working out.
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:34.160]   When I say in the disclaimer that I play on every show that feel free to come by and correct me,
[02:59:34.160 --> 02:59:41.120]   I mean it. And my goal is that those of you who are listening will value this type of approach
[02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:50.000]   and that together we can continue on to create a better future. That's ultimately
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:56.080]   one of the things that will ally someone like me, a biblical Christian,
[02:59:56.080 --> 03:00:01.200]   with a secular humanist, is that we're all working to create a different future. We have
[03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:06.080]   radically different worldviews on how that's done. We in many ways have similar goals.
[03:00:06.080 --> 03:00:13.360]   So I'll keep on doing my job to expose and understand the ideas that affect finance.
[03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:19.040]   Hope this is a useful show for you to clarify and understand the importance of worldview.
[03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:23.760]   I thought a lot about this show. I don't know whether it was successful or not. I know that
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:29.920]   I took a risk with going into such unusual subjects. If it was ineffective, feel free to
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:34.320]   just toss it aside as ineffective. But as I learn and become a better teacher,
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:44.480]   I see constantly every day financial propaganda. It's absurd. And so much of it is the nose under
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:50.000]   the tent analogy. And as I've looked and looked and looked over the years to try to figure out
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:54.240]   how can I demonstrate or where can I see, first of all, is this the nose under the tent? Because
[03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:57.840]   what happens is when you see the camel nose come under the tent and you say to the people in the
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:01.200]   tent, "Look, there's a camel nose. The coal camel's coming in. He wants to get into the tent."
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:06.480]   Then people often say, "Are you kidding? Come on, that's a camel nose. It's just a tiny little
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:14.000]   thing." And so in so much of past history, I've struggled to see and understand actually in my
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:21.680]   life. And when I found those documents and that book and the resources on the homosexual movement,
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:27.040]   I for the first time was able to see in my lifetime, my short lifetime, the development
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:31.840]   of an idea and the massive transformation of society. It's incredible, incredible.
[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:37.840]   So now I've taken those lessons that I've learned from studying, how did they do it?
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:45.600]   How did Kirk and Madsen set it out? What was their plan? Now you apply it to banking. You apply it
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:53.440]   to monetary systems. You apply it to government. You apply it to taxes. You apply it to progressivism.
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:58.640]   You apply it to libertarianism. And I can start to see
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:06.000]   the impact. And that for me has been helpful. That's why I took this approach.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:13.680]   So if it seems disconnected, that's just due to my poor lack of skill as a teacher. But I'm trying,
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:21.520]   these are such deeply held beliefs and very few of us have assessed them and worked them out in a
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:28.160]   way that is consistent. And so this is my best effort at it. And I'd love your feedback. If you
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:32.800]   thought this was at least provocative and useful, I'd love your feedback. If you hated it, I'm happy
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:37.920]   to hear from you. I'm learning as we go and trying to learn how to more effectively present and teach
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:43.920]   things. But I try, with this show, I'm trying to address things that I've always hated. I always
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:52.080]   hate when people misrepresent their opponent's philosophy. So that's why I read so extensively
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:58.640]   from those essays and from the manifesto and from the essay by Kirk and Madsen. I don't like people
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:04.480]   to misrepresent me. I'd rather they hear it in totality. And so then you can understand. But
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:08.560]   that's unusual in today's soundbite culture. So I recognize that I'm taking a risk and very few
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:14.080]   people actually listen to this, but at least you have a little bit more accurate information.
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:23.040]   I'm not gonna tell you what to think, but think. That's good. That'll be my new tagline. I don't
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:28.480]   tell you what to think, but think critically and comprehensively, and we'll all learn together.
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:32.160]   That's it for today's show. I thank you very much for listening. Another three hour show,
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:36.240]   but at least this one, I don't feel like I rambled around. I feel like I was just going to accurately
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:45.120]   present my different perspectives and viewpoints. So if this was beneficial for you, I'd be happy to
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:49.840]   hear from you. RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron. And you know what? Today with it being show,
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:52.640]   I'm gonna pull the music out and let's start the disclaimer and I'm out of here. Cheers, y'all.
