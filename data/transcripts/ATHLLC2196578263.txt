[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:09.800]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.920]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here on my
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.200]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.080]   Today's conversation is going to be really fantastic because I'm sitting down,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.160]   virtually at least, with Brian Kelly.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.680]   And if that name isn't familiar, it's probably because you know him better
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.680]   as The Points Guy, which is the name of the site he founded in 2010 during his
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480]   time as a Wall Street road warrior, where he developed his unique ability to maximize
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.280]   his travel experiences while minimizing his spending.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.600]   Since then, he's grown the company into a powerhouse travel and lifestyle
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.800]   media platform through a team of dozens of editors and
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680]   freelancers that span the globe.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.200]   I know I'm an avid reader of the TPG site and appreciate all the work his team
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.040]   puts in to create such great content.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.280]   In our conversation, we'll talk about travel in this post-pandemic world,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   the current state of points and miles, and we'll get Brian's take on his
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.000]   favorite destinations, credit cards, travel hacks, and more.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.880]   I know you'll enjoy this conversation with Brian Kelly, so let's jump in.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   Brian, thanks for being here.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.200]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.640]   Yeah, I am excited.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.440]   This has been a long time coming.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.480]   You've been a top requested guest, people really
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.640]   passionate about points here.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.000]   I know the last 18 months has been a pretty atypical month for travel
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200]   and things are coming back.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   So I'll just kick it off.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.240]   Have you had a chance to take some trips recently?
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.560]   Oh, Chris, I've had some of my best trips over the pandemic.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.040]   You know, when it first hit in March, I took a hundred days off, which was, I
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.960]   think, the longest I'd ever not traveled since maybe I was in high school.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.160]   And then I started small, like Palm Springs.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.000]   Then I went to the island of Antigua.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   When that first opened, that was kind of my first international trip.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.360]   And from that point, I just started to go.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.760]   I think one of my favorite trips of all time, I did French Polynesia.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.960]   So Bora Bora, and I cannot recommend enough.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.480]   Go in September, October.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.720]   You can swim with the humpback whales off the island of Morea.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.960]   Have you ever been to Morea?
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.840]   We went to the Conrad in Bora Bora and, you know, everyone says, oh, well,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.600]   that doesn't face the caldera in the middle.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   And I was like, yeah, but it's a pretty nice hotel.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.160]   Yeah, I stayed at the Conrad as well.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.800]   I've stayed at the St.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.400]   Regis and I loved the Conrad.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280]   It was kind of newer, fresher in my opinion.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.120]   Although I, you know, if you're going to go all out this, you
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.360]   can't go wrong with St. Regis.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.600]   But Morea is so cool.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.080]   There's only a soft Patel and a Hilton, so it's not as high end, but you can
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.520]   kind of go all around the island.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.800]   And I did two days of private boat and snorkels.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.000]   And I came face to face with a humpback and her little calf, 20, 20 feet from my
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.680]   eyes, she was vertical looking at me.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.040]   And it was one of those moments of, oh my God, like, is this real right now?
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.800]   So, so yeah.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.960]   And then I've done, I did Kenya and trek with the gorillas in Rwanda.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   Dubai.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.600]   Wow.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.720]   And this summer I did a bunch of Europe trips and Europe was amazing this
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.680]   summer because there were no Americans, amazing award availability at the lowest
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   levels, pretty much any day of the week.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.880]   I took my family, seven of us, you know, Sabre level seats on Lufthansa.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.040]   You know, so it was like, it's been an amazing time to use points.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.920]   Certainly demand is coming back and it's getting harder and harder, but, you
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.120]   know, I still think for the next couple of years, there's going to be great
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.680]   opportunities to visit places that were over touristed, the Machu Picchus of the
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.040]   world, you know, Thailand, James Bond beach right now, my friend is there and
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   it's completely empty for the first time, like history since the movie came out.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.600]   So I think there's still a lot of opportunities for travelers.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Are there places that, you know, haven't opened up that you're most excited about?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.360]   I mean, I'm craving Asia.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.520]   Thailand just opened up Singapore.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.640]   I am hoping Japan I've heard through the grapevine, maybe Jan one, but for, I
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.440]   think I'll be going for cherry blossoms if it's open, I just, you know, it's
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.960]   been a couple of years of, of no Asia travel.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.840]   So yeah, I think that'll be, I'm hoping by, you know, mid 2022, the
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.560]   world is essentially reopened.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.040]   I found in the couple of trips we've taken that it doesn't feel as unsafe as
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.760]   it might seem.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.400]   I don't know if you found something similar.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.760]   No, I feel 100% safer in any other country besides the United States for a
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.520]   host of reasons, but even just looking at, you know, and I'm vaccinated, I had
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.080]   an asymptomatic case of COVID.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.840]   I, I, I got tested recently.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.560]   My antibodies are through the roof, so I feel personally comfortable even if I get
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280]   a breakthrough infection or whatever, but you know, around the world, people take
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.120]   this very seriously.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.600]   Whereas I think 40% of the country doesn't at all in the U S so that makes, you know,
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   no matter where you are, you know, very widely varying protocols, uncertainty.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.040]   Whereas when you go to most countries, you kind of understand what you're going to
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.600]   get and there are pretty strict protocols.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   So, so yeah, it was funny when people were like, travel's dangerous, stay home, stay
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.480]   in the U S I'm like, that was at a time when like my friend broke his leg and
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   couldn't even get an ER room in Florida, in Miami beach, you know, on vacation.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.920]   He didn't even have COVID.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.280]   He couldn't even, you know, he was in a waiting room for 20 hours.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.040]   So, you know, I think the U S has gotten much better, but you know, I, I don't, I
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.560]   hate when people just think, oh, traveling is dangerous abroad is where you get this
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.280]   scary virus when it's like literally the exact opposite when it's rampant in the
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.760]   U S yeah, yeah.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.400]   It's, uh, we had a chance to go to Greece.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.160]   It felt great.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.280]   It was just good to be out, good to be around other people from other
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.880]   countries and eat other food.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.000]   And it was amazing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So I know the pandemic's changed the landscape of some of the rules and stuff.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.400]   How have points and, and everything really evolved since you started
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.600]   and what are you doing differently?
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.240]   So points, I think have gotten more valuable because while most airlines
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.440]   now, well, U S airlines will let you change a flight and get a voucher.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.080]   A crappy voucher that you may not be able to use for the full
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.320]   amount that might expire.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   You probably can't use for someone else.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.760]   It's a pretty restricted currency.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.520]   I think they've marketed it as, oh, book and do whatever you want.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.960]   But, oh, and by the way, not with basic economy or other tickets.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   So on the flip side with points, it's gotten much more flexible.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.680]   You know, almost every loyalty program now will let you change.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.480]   Even if you're not an elite member change, cancel free of
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.960]   charge, get all your points back.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.280]   So I think points have gotten more flexible.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.640]   And if there's one thing travelers need these days, it's flexibility.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.480]   Now it's interesting dynamics because airfares have come down as well.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.520]   So the relative value of points, uh, you would think that, well, you're
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.880]   not getting as much bang for your buck.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.040]   Cause these flights are cheap.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.920]   Let me just book them.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.080]   So, you know, it just depends.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.840]   I mean, it certainly depends on routes.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.520]   I mean, I've flown Emirates first class numerous times, tons of
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.440]   availability, like I've never seen before.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.640]   And, and not all flights are cheap these days, you know, especially
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.360]   since travels bounce back, you know, airfares in the U S are up 30% in 2021.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.520]   And, you know, rising going to be above the 2019 level.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   So bottom line, I think points are valuable because they're
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.160]   more flexible than ever.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.800]   Cause you can, it's basically like buying a refundable ticket and getting
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.000]   all of your, your currency back, you know, credit cards, if there's still
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   a war out there with huge signup bonuses.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.680]   Across the board.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.640]   So it's an amazing time for consumers to get cards.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.520]   I even helped launch the built credit card, which is the first ever credit card.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.440]   No annual fee.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.200]   It's a master card and you earn points on rent with no fees to any
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.720]   landlord, which was huge.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.640]   There's a wait list for it.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.080]   It'll be fully launching to the public in early 2022.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.960]   But now, I mean, when you look at your spend, whether it's groceries
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.600]   or online advertising, there's so many category bonuses on credit
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.160]   cards and new credit cards.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.120]   And there's some new cards coming that I know about and can't give
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.520]   details on, but there's some exciting stuff in the pipeline.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.080]   So for points, people, you know, some people are just naysayers and
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.200]   saying the points game's over.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.360]   It's not what it used to be.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   It's just false.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.000]   There's more opportunities than ever to earn.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And yeah, on the burn side, you might be spending more miles
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.760]   than you did 10 years ago, but your earn rate should be three X what it was.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.960]   So as long as you're earning a lot more than the rate at which you're burning,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.080]   I think you're coming out pretty good.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.520]   So one of the, when it comes to earning, a common thing I hear is people
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   say, well, you have to be rich and spend tons of money, or you have to have a
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.400]   job where you have all these expenses.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.880]   And if I'm not one of those people, this game doesn't work for me.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.760]   I'm curious what you would say to that person.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.080]   I mean, I would just firmly push back.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.360]   If you have a good credit score, if you're not going to be tempted to
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.440]   spend out of your means and mire yourself in debt, you can absolutely
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   play this game and win, you know, there's probably 10 major banks that
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.480]   offer credit cards and there's probably five solid cards, which each of those
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.120]   banks, probably 50 decent cards out there that offer hundreds, if not
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.680]   thousands in values per signup.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.440]   And, you know, I've got 26 credit cards right now.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.960]   I've got an 800 FICO.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.160]   And as long as you manage them, you can get new cards every year and new
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.400]   issuers, you know, even my Chase Sapphire reserve, which I got in 2016, a hundred
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.520]   thousand points, you know, Sapphire preferred had a hundred thousand point
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   offer as well this year.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.720]   So I downgraded my Sapphire reserve to a freedom flex card.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.200]   And then a couple of weeks later applied as a new member for Chase Sapphire
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.280]   preferred banking a hundred thousand points, because you just can't have had
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.560]   a Sapphire bonus within the last four years.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.680]   So I was over that.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.840]   So there's ways to keep trading down, you know, advanced people in this game.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.360]   No, the signup bonuses are huge.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.160]   You maximize category bonuses.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.440]   And even if you're an average person spending, you know, a couple thousand
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.000]   dollars a month, if you're maximizing, if you're getting your rent points, if
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.880]   you're making sure you use as little cash as possible shopping through shopping
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.240]   portals, there are many ways to travel and get free trips every year without
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.880]   being a road warrior or, you know, small business owner with millions
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.080]   in, in credit card spend.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.440]   I mean, obviously if you have those things, it's even better, but.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.960]   I I'm curious.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.080]   So you 26 cards, I play the same game and have a lot.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.400]   How do you keep track of everything?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.840]   And, and beyond just the cards, I imagine you have at least 20 different mileage
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   accounts and you know, that's a lot.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.760]   Well, you know, I had always used a word wallet, which had its limitations
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.280]   that not every program was tracked.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.520]   One of my goals at the points guy was always creating an app that really
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.080]   attract all loyalty points, every major airline hotel, which we just launched.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.160]   Uh, this September, uh, it's out in the Apple store.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.320]   Just search for the points guy.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.040]   Andrew's coming shortly, but you basically, you get your net worth in
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.520]   points at our current TPG valuations.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.560]   We also track your credit card spend.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.400]   We'll tell you missed opportunities.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.120]   You know, I'm the points guy, but I still will use the wrong
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.720]   card for certain purchases.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.080]   You know, there's just so many.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.320]   No one person can compute instantly all the different
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.920]   variables and opportunities.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.000]   So that's why I wanted to create an app that, that tracked it all.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.680]   But you know, I've got a similar to you.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.920]   I've got a, uh, eight figure points balance because we run millions a month
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.120]   in online ads through my personal credit cards at the points guy.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.600]   And then we use those points for our company travel.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   And, you know, we don't take previews from airlines in general.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.000]   We use points for everything.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.440]   So I will say I have so many Amex and chase points that I have lately been
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.240]   going and using like capital one, which allows you to basically wipe off any
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.280]   sort of travel charge, including helicopters or Ubers, or even taxes on
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.360]   award tickets, because, you know, I think a lot of people have hoarded so many
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.760]   points, you can only use so many Amex points, right?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.880]   Like there's only so much time in a year and, and travel you can
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.760]   do in first class to actually.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.920]   You know, and I know this sounds like such a privileged thing to say,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.480]   but it really is like, just like finance, like diversifying your
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.760]   points balances so they don't just sit there and grow.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.640]   I think I'm guilty of sometimes hoarding points.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.840]   And, you know, I'm like, Oh, I haven't used those points.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.520]   And all of a sudden it's like, well, this, this airline's getting devalued
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   and you're like, I should, I should be using these points, but yeah, it's,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   it's a problem I think a lot of us face when you think about having
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.320]   points in lots of different places.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.960]   I know that when you started the points guy, you started doing an
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.520]   award booking service for people, helping people book flights.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.840]   Do you, do you book all of your award flights yourself now?
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.720]   Or how does that work?
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.320]   Yeah, I don't use a service.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.520]   So yeah, the points guy before it was even a blog.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.480]   So it was like April, 2010, I started it and it was just a form.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.600]   And I wanted to create a business because I was working at Morgan Stanley.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.640]   That was, I could make a couple extra a hundred bucks a week being in my
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.160]   twenties and broke as hell living in New York.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.960]   Um, and I loved award booking.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.320]   Cause it's like solving a puzzle.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.280]   And it was like using the knowledge I had in my head, expert flyer.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.200]   I could do for most people like what they couldn't do themselves.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.720]   You know, once we got in the credit card affiliate game, it
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.680]   just changed the entire dynamics.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.120]   And I realized writing content to millions of people is much, much
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.600]   better than doing one-on-one consultations, you know, things
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.320]   would change it was so time consuming.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.840]   Um, there are good, you know, booking services out there.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.360]   I know juicy miles points pros.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   I do recommend it.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.040]   If you don't have the time to do it yourself.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.600]   I also have a assistant who is a points wizard that I'm very fortunate.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.040]   We'll, we'll do the things like, you know, call and change
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.160]   my, my travel changes by the minute.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.640]   I mean, I'll change, you know, if I see what times of first class
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   availability open up last minute, I'll switch to that.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.360]   I almost always extend or come home early.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.120]   So that's why I always book one way awards.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.680]   And then I'm always just looking for what is the absolute most
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.440]   comfortable way I can fly, you know, elite status.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.000]   I do have United one K, but in general, at least that is, you know, when
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.200]   you have so many points, I don't even bother with hoping for an upgrade.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.920]   Cause that to me is too stressful.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.480]   So, so yeah, it's all about just like maximizing points,
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   but I still do it myself.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.000]   I love, you know, sitting down with a cup of coffee and looking
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.320]   at like, okay, I've got my friend's 50th birthday in Barcelona next month.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.720]   What should I do?
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.880]   Should I stop and see friends in London on the way?
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.760]   Should I try the new JetBlue mints?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.160]   Is the studio open?
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   You know, like it's still enjoyable for me to, to piece it all together.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.480]   And do you have that all in your head?
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.800]   I know one time my process was okay.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.720]   Well, I had a Google spreadsheet that had all the trans Pacific flights,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.320]   and then I would like group them by Alliance.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.280]   And I would start, you know, searching, searching.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.400]   I remember there was a time where I started using KVS tool.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.720]   I don't know if you ever had to use that.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.800]   It's like the, it's like this windows program.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.360]   So I'd have to run around.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.600]   It's still around.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.360]   And if you have a Mac, you have to run windows on your Mac.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.640]   So you can use this tool.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.840]   You know, what do you, what do you do?
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.120]   Just know it all now at this point, or how do you kind
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.240]   of keep track of everything?
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.280]   Yeah, I have a running list in my head.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.120]   I, you know, I like to fly different carriers.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.560]   I think it, you know, and I, I generally a lot of time I'll read
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.880]   our points guy reviews of the airline.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.160]   I think we've got most major ones carry, but especially now post pandemic,
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.240]   it's a whole new ball game.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.440]   So yeah.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.840]   And a lot of times I'll just let the availability dictate which, which, you
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.320]   know, if I want to fly ANA and JL, but you know, JL has got the availability.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.440]   That's the route I'll go.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.560]   I generally avoid us carriers when flying internationally.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.840]   I fly them enough domestically and the experience is essentially the same on,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.680]   you know, so yeah, it's usually just in my head.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.840]   But I, there, you have a group, a bunch of great, if you, if anyone's
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.520]   listening to this and is thinking, gosh, how do I use my Amex points?
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.480]   I can tell you, there's probably a dozen articles that'll, that'll
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.120]   walk you through the best redemptions on Amex, the best ways to transfer.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.000]   You know, I think everyone listening here, hopefully already knows that
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.200]   transferring your points is, is going to be a much bigger win than the portal.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.520]   Is there any time that you actually use your points in a portal or
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.000]   for anything other than transferring?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.640]   I gave up my apartment in New York during the pandemic, and I
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.200]   would come in and stay at hotels.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.880]   And I have so many points and I don't want to stay in a book and award, you
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.760]   know, normal room, you know, especially I have dogs.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.840]   So for example, the only real hotel that you can take to rescues is Soho Grand.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.560]   They're so dog friendly, amazing.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.120]   They're not a part of any points program.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.960]   And you know, their penthouse is like a thousand bucks a night.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.560]   So I was using 70,000 chase points a night to pay for the thousand bucks
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   so I could stay for free in a penthouse.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:56.840]   You know?
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.120]   So it's like, you do generally get value by transferring to United
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.560]   and flying Lufthansa first class for 110,000 points one way, but I didn't
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.360]   need to go Lufthansa first class anywhere.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.840]   And I still have zillions of other points to do that, you know?
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.720]   So, um, yeah, I do like fancy non points hotels.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.400]   So using cap one points to wipe off the state.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.600]   So house, you can't even book that through most portals, but you can
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.400]   just wipe that charge off as a purchase eraser and speaking of hotels.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.520]   So I tend to think that if you want to use points for hotels, it's
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.880]   chase transfer to Hyatt, stay at high end Hyatt, 30,000 points a night,
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.160]   or even sometimes 25 things like we recently, fortunately, right before
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.240]   the pandemic, we went to Japan and we got to do the new park Hyatt Kyoto.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.480]   It was fantastic.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.520]   I, is there another angle for transferring points to hotels
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.920]   that you've ever found make sense?
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.240]   You know, I recently MX had big bonuses to Hilton and Marriott.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.160]   Uh, I did the math.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.200]   So I go to Miami quite a bit and I was staying at the W which was
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.800]   like 80,000 Marriott points a night.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.200]   And there was a 50% bonus from Amex.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.480]   So basically, and it was a $2,000 a night hotel during peak weeks.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.680]   So I was doing the math and like 50,000 Amex points was getting me a $2,000.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.400]   A night hotel during these super crazy weeks.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.960]   And I would get upgraded and elite status.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.680]   So I did transfer Amex to Marriott.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.200]   I have also for the Waldorf Astoria Maldives, when you can find it for 90,000
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.160]   Hilton, when there's an Amex to Hilton, it's already one and a half, uh, one to
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.920]   one and a half, but when it's one to two, 45,000 Amex points for $1,500 room.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.520]   It's a pretty good value.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.800]   You know, you're getting over 3 cents per point.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.880]   So yeah, there are in general though, Amex is best to airlines and Hyatt
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.160]   points are extremely valuable.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.520]   And now Chase and also now built the credit card that you earn points on rent.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.440]   You can transfer actually to Hyatt one-to-one or American as well.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.560]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.800]   You all know, I love credit card points.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.440]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.400]   my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.560]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.200]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.240]   purchase, you can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.840]   know the best cards to use.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.960]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.640]   credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.720]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America, or
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.080]   Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.320]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.960]   Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.440]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.280]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.720]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.760]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.640]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:02.040]   will, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.280]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.920]   I get it.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.200]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.520]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.560]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.440]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.960]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.880]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.920]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.760]   you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.640]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.040]   your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.360]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.880]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.520]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.520]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.640]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.560]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.920]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.360]   Yeah, I feel like we always talk in the points world about Chase and
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.000]   Amex are like the core tenants.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.520]   And I know, I don't remember how many years ago it was, but, you know,
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.840]   Cap One, Citi, they weren't really transfer points and now they are.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.920]   How do you think Citi, Capital One, and I guess Built fit in this ecosystem
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.280]   with most of the conversation focusing on Chase and Amex?
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.440]   I mean, Capital One is really stepping up their game.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.000]   I went to their first new lounge that they're opening up at
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.800]   Dallas Fort Worth, gorgeous.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.400]   Like Peloton bikes, relaxation rooms, really high-end food and beverage.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.000]   In venture, yes, you can use your points for purchase eraser, or you
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.360]   can transfer one-to-one to Aeroplan, even Turkish now, there's
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.680]   a bunch of one-to-one partners.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.240]   When Capital One launched, they were funky.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.400]   It wasn't one-to-one.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.080]   It was very complicated math.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.640]   And now they've listened to our feedback and they have
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.840]   a lot of one-to-one partners.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.520]   So I think Capital One is somewhat of the underdog.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.800]   They've always been huge with that mid-market and sub, not subprime,
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.600]   but the lower market cards, and they've really made huge
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.120]   strides in the up-market space.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.200]   Citi, I love my Citi points.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.480]   I use my Prestige for 5X on dining most of the time.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.560]   The transfer partners aren't as prestigious.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.440]   For a while, you could transfer to American, which was kind of cool.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.400]   Their partners are second tier, and even Citi's kind of backing
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.120]   away from the premium, you can't even get the Prestige card anymore.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.920]   I don't think Citi knows exactly what it wants to be
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.240]   totally in the marketplace.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   They've launched more cash back cards lately, but, you know, and
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.960]   they've kind of, the Citi Prestige and the Fortnite Free used to be so amazing.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.040]   They've rolled that back.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.560]   So I think Capital One is rising in the up-market reward space and
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.000]   Citi's kind of in a holding pattern.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.600]   I mean, I recommend the Citi Double Cash when people don't
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.280]   want to play the points game, but I haven't had a Citi card since, I
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.200]   remember there was a 75,000 point American signup bonus on all three
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.960]   cards, and I remember getting all three in one day, and those
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.120]   were the last Citi cards I had.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.080]   Well, and it's interesting with the American Airlines new, did you
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.400]   see their new elite program where they're revamping how you earn elite status?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.640]   So instead, they're getting away with EQDs and Ms and whatever, they're
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.480]   now just have AA loyalty points that, so you need 200,000 points
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.680]   in a year to get exec plat, but you could spend 200 grand on a co-branded
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.160]   card and without stepping on a plane, earn a exec plat, so all these
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.240]   programs are really becoming frequent spender programs, we've seen that
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.280]   slowly over time as they're adding in these revenue requirements and there's
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.720]   winners and losers with every change.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.840]   If you are buying expensive tickets and spending a lot on credit cards, there's
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.480]   never been a better time to be in this space.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.840]   If you're on a shoestring budget, trying to buy mistake fares and get
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.080]   top tier status, it's a lot harder to do that nowadays.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.360]   I got to be careful with America and I have some bad relationships there from,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.880]   I don't know if you remember, maybe, I don't know, 10 years ago, it seemed
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.320]   there, there was a promo with this card called Founders Card and Founders Card
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.840]   gave everyone that signed up for it free AA gold and so the card was a hundred
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:37.040]   bucks a year and you can't buy AA gold at the time, the lower tier statuses
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.600]   have kind of gotten worse over the years, but back then, AA gold for 100
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.320]   bucks was a no-brainer and so I went on Flyer Talk, I posted my referral link
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.920]   and probably four or five hundred people signed up and it turns out the American
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.000]   team that did this deal with Founders Card was just like a guy that kind of
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.800]   did it on the side and it was fine, but AA HQ sent a cease and desist to Founders
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.280]   Card, they asked me to get removed from the program, all the referral points
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.400]   I'd gotten got removed, everyone thought I was scamming everyone and so...
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.960]   I remember Founders Card's interesting, over the years, it's like, we have
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.080]   benefits, but they can't really say what they are, you know?
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.840]   Yeah, though this is a reason because they're not allowed to market the
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.640]   benefits because they want people to sign up for other reasons.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.320]   Right.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.360]   Yeah, so 26 cards, when do you think about canceling cards?
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.880]   Do you have a rule of thumb that you use when you get a new one for a bonus?
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.360]   Absolutely, I generally don't cancel cards, I'll usually downgrade them to
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.240]   like a no-fee version, that even the no-fee cards usually have some perks
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.880]   that are valuable, you know, I look at every card in my wallet, I mean, I'm a
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.320]   little bit different, I'm in the cards business, so it's like, having cards,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.480]   getting the marketing materials, it's like, it's good for business and also I
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.680]   get reimbursed on annual fees as part of being a TPG employee, we have a cool
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.640]   program, but in general, if I'm not using the card, I don't want the account to
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.520]   just be dormant, because they'll close it automatically with no activity, so if
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.720]   I can't downgrade it, I will cancel a card if there's just absolutely no
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.280]   real benefit to it, but most cards these days have perks that easily have the
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.880]   annual fees on them, but you know, I recommend to people do an audit twice a
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.800]   year, three times a year and get rid of the ones that aren't holding their weight.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.520]   Yeah, a reader wrote in and asked, you know, should I keep my Marriott Bonvoy
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.840]   card and you know, the annual benefit, it's like, I think it's 95 bucks and you
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.960]   get a hotel in a category four and my answer is, if you're going to use the
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.000]   category four, it's a no-brainer, if you're not going to use the category
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.920]   four, depends how much you spend at Marriott, right? The multipliers on a
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.040]   Marriott card, if you're spending money at a Marriott are great, pretty good,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.920]   yeah, but if you're not, you know, so I still have my Southwest card, which is
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.760]   a bummer, because I think Southwest has a huge bonus right now, 100,000, yeah,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.840]   get that companion pass, yeah, so if you're listening, but don't do it, do you
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.680]   think it'll still be around Jan 1? Well, you can apply, just don't hit your
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.280]   minimum spend until the new year, so the points drop, you know, the statement
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.840]   after you hit your spend, so you can get it, yeah. I made that mistake once and I
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.680]   had to transfer some Marriott points to try to close the gap, because you need
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.560]   it, you used to need two Southwest cards to hit the companion pass, yeah. Yeah,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.520]   yeah, the companion pass on Southwest is one of the best perks out there, you can
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.480]   read more about it, just Google Southwest companion pass ins and outs, but
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.520]   essentially, if you qualify for it in January of any given year, for two years
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:34.000]   through the end of December the next year, a passenger applies free with you,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.160]   whether you're paying with points or cash on Southwest, so think about if you
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.600]   travel with someone else, you can change a companion over time, but it's an
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.040]   insanely valuable, kind of one of those insider things that people, if you fly
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.400]   Southwest, you should know about the companion pass, and you can qualify, you
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.840]   don't have to fly 100 flights, you can qualify via credit card sign-up bonus
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.960]   and spend, and when the sign-up bonuses are like 100,000, you only need to spend
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:03.040]   like 10,000 or less to get this amazing benefit. Just make sure if you're going
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.960]   to go for this next year, which means buy one, get one free 2022 and 2023, and by
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.520]   the way, that works with points, so when you use those 100,000 points to book
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.160]   flights, you still get a free companion. You just pay the $5 TSA fee, it's
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.400]   amazing. Exactly, so if you're doing that, don't hit that minimum spend any
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.760]   earlier than Jan 1, or you'll lose a whole year of it. Any other big sign-up
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.280]   bonuses or cool deals right now? Yeah, I mean, I think there's a ton, I mean,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.800]   there's just so many perks over the pandemic, you know, credit card companies
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.520]   have added tons of perks to cards, trying to think if there's any one in
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.560]   particular. Or any new perks you're excited about? Well, I mean, definitely
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.800]   these Capital One lounges, they haven't announced who will get access to them,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.880]   but just seeing the lounge, there's going to be one in Denver and DC in 2022,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.760]   the Dallas one opens November 2021, that I'm excited about. What about some of
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.600]   these crazy aspirational cards? Everyone in this game always is like, "Ah, that
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.960]   Amex Black, that Amex Black," and then I had a friend who got it, he's like, "You
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.080]   know what, like the way I spend, I don't know if it's worth it." What do you
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.640]   think of the high-end cards? Yeah, so I've had the Centurion card for five
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.160]   years now, but the key is get the business Centurion. The personal
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.080]   Centurion is horrible. It's literally worse than a platinum card, unless you
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.400]   really value Equinox membership. The reason the business Centurion is so
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.840]   valuable, they don't advertise it, well, they don't advertise the cards at all,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.760]   is that you get a 50% rebate on pay with points, which means your Amex points
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.560]   are worth two cents each towards buying flights through the Amex
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.280]   portal. And Amex travel also has discounted business class fares that
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.640]   are fully more flexible. So with an Amex Platinum, your points are
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.000]   worth one cent. Business Platinum, they're worth 1.35 cents per point. And
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.240]   with the Centurion, you're getting two cents per point in value. So really, if
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.280]   you have tons of Amex points and you like the flexibility to buy whatever
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.600]   flight you want, you earn elite miles on those flights, that's the no-brainer.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.640]   Centurion, it's $5,000 a year now, you get top-tier access to Equinox. So if
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   you don't live in a city where there's an Equinox, that's a $0 benefit.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.960]   So there's a bunch of other perks. I mean, in general, my Amex concierge,
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.520]   Ray, the way I value it is that he's our booker for all TPG high-end travel.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.960]   And during the pandemic, when shit hit the fan and you couldn't even get
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.400]   through to an airline for credits and things like that, I just email Ray and
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.520]   say, "Cancel these four tickets. We get full refunds." You have the backing of
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.920]   Amex at you, and there's a value to that. The purchase protection is insane.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.280]   Anything I break, even if it's my fault, they'll pretty much just wipe off my
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.360]   charge. So yes, points are one side of the equation, but when you look at these
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.720]   super premium cards, you really have to look at the perks and your personal...
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.240]   Centurion lounges are super crowded and you'll get turned away a lot of times
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.600]   due to overcrowding, but never if you're a Centurion. They'll even clear a table
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.720]   for you and give you VUV. So that's kind of cool.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.360]   So business Centurion, I think, is a winner. And if you do want to, you can
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.600]   call Amex and raise your hand and say you're interested in the card. There's
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   no official way to apply for it though. Amex Platinum just raised their annual
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.440]   fee. They added a bunch of other perks. If you can get value out of the soul
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.400]   cycle benefit or... People do say, "Oh, it's a little bit like a coupon book."
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.160]   And it's not exactly that. I think it's a little bit more valuable, but you
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.280]   should go through and say, "Well, I actually get that value from this card."
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   We've seen huge interest... Even after Amex raised the annual fee on the
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.120]   Platinum, there's still huge interest in the card. They just reported in their
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.440]   quarterly results. Huge uptick in interest. So there is a market. People
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.280]   want to pay for premium experiences. So I bet Amex will continue to double down
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.040]   on the premium space, whereas Chase and Citi and Cap One are a little bit of a
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.240]   step down in terms of the annual fees and the perks that they're offering.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.200]   Have you ever gone too far with all the points and miles game? Is there a
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.360]   particular reward or experience where you're like, "You know what? You can go
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.680]   too deep down the rabbit hole at some points?"
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.400]   Well, I think in general, pre-pandemic, I was just traveling nonstop. And too
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:22.400]   much of a good thing is a bad thing. I was constantly jet lagged. I had a lot
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   of work travel, plus I do a lot of charity work, and then plus personal
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.680]   travel. And it was all blending together. So I think in general, I overdosed on
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.920]   travel. And so the pandemic for me was a really nice way and once-in-a-lifetime
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.160]   opportunity to hit that reset and rebuild my travel into a place where it
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.680]   actually serves me. Just because I can doesn't mean I should. I say that to
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.480]   myself all the time now. I'm learning how to say no to things, even though
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.240]   it's, "Oh, Paris is reopening, and Air France has business class
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.280]   availability. I have to go to Paris this weekend, even though I have four other
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.880]   plans next week, and I know I'll be exhausted." So I think in general, I've
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.280]   never been a crazy miles and points person in terms of the gray areas, even
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.920]   mileage running. I've only really ever done one or two mileage runs in my life.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.680]   I'm not the type to fly to Australia and turn around and fly back. To me, that
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.360]   just, it really is crazy. And luckily, I fly enough where I don't have to do
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.240]   that. I understand why people do, and I'm not judging it, but I try to keep the
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:26.880]   points and miles addiction to a minimum and realize my personal physical health
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.800]   is far more valuable than any point or mile.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.160]   Absolutely. Yeah. And I think I'm similar to you in that over the time, as you
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.880]   learn the points game and you maximize points, elite status just matters less.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:44.400]   And so I think I have my Silver United through Marriott, which is basically, I
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   get a free checked bag, which we have a kid now. So I never thought checked bags
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.800]   mattered. And then you had a child and I'm like, "Can I check six bags? How do I
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.200]   set this?" I got a crib and a car seat and all this stuff. Do you ever check
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.880]   bags? I do. It annoys me. I was in Europe for two weeks this summer. I just
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:09.040]   couldn't. They were different climates, beach. And so I will check a bag. It is
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.360]   so annoying though. I hate myself when I do it because I was flying from Ibiza to
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.800]   Milan on EasyJet. And I'm like, "Whatever. I'll just pay to check the bag."
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.600]   Well, of course there's a strike in Italy, an air traffic strike. Flights
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.440]   delayed nine hours. I'm like, "No way in hell am I going to sit at this crowded,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.200]   horrible airport for nine hours." So great. I'm just going to rebook myself.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.440]   "Oh, crap. My bag is on the plane." I go and EasyJet has no employees anywhere.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.280]   So I'm like, "Okay, well, I'll just go back to the check-in counter and someone
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.720]   there will have to figure it out." Well, EasyJet has two flights a day out of
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:50.160]   Ibiza. And the same employee that works at was working the 100-person long line
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.040]   that I've refused to wait in. But now I'm past security.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.600]   So I ended up getting it. I had to get like a cop in the airport to help get an
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.480]   airport manager that they pulled the bag off the plane. But especially nowadays,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:08.560]   travel goes wrong so often. Delays, cancellations. You really limit yourself
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.000]   when you check a bag because you can't just pop off a plane. "Oh, there's another
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.160]   flight to Chicago across the hall. I'm going to hop on that," which is the joy of
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.040]   miles and points, especially. You can be sitting on a plane and rebook yourself.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.760]   But long story short, if I'm going on a long trip, I like to have different looks
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.640]   every day on vacation. And when you're in the social media eye, people will call
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.680]   you out for wearing the same thing over and over. So maybe I should probably
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.400]   stop caring about that. Yeah. I mean, we just went on a flight
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   this past weekend to Austin and everything was delayed. We get to the airport and
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.520]   they're like, "Hey, you're going to miss your connection." And we're like, "But
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.960]   there's a nonstop. Can we just get on the nonstop?" They're like, "Well, it's
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.120]   oversold, but 28 people haven't checked in." And I was feeling good. And they're
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.200]   like, "There's 2 people ahead of you." And they called them up first. And they
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.920]   were like, "Did you check bags?" They're like, "Yes." And they're like, "Sorry."
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   And then they called us. So that was the one where I was feeling pretty good we
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.320]   didn't check bags because we managed to get out.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.960]   I was just spending time with the senior airline exec. And we're talking about
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.480]   this topic. And he's like, "Honestly, when I interview people, I ask them, 'Do
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.280]   you check a bag?' And if they say yes, they don't get the job."
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.560]   Oh, man. It's cold. Of course.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.920]   You mentioned earlier using the Amex Concierge. When you travel, how do you
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.200]   collect information? I know TPG has a ton of great content on airlines, hotels,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.880]   but what about when you're figuring out what to do somewhere, where to eat, are
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.000]   there sources or concierges or anything you use?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.120]   It's awesome. Instagram for me is so amazing. Last week, I went to Dallas for
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.520]   the first time in a couple of years. And I know Dallas has a pretty good food
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.840]   scene. So as I was boarding at Newark, I said, "All right, off to Dallas. What
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:54.640]   do you got?" And hundreds and hundreds of messages come in. And I just source.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.120]   You see the patterns. And my readers have really good taste. So I've never
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.840]   gotten bad recommendations.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.000]   Now, what we want to do at TPG. So we just bought Lonely Planet about a year
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.800]   or so ago. So we envision the points guy being getting you there. Lonely Planet
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   really diving deep into cool experiences. So Lonely Planet is about to relaunch
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.720]   really cool new branding and lots of investment into what to do when you're
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:26.560]   there. But I think we can do more at TPG as well. I'd love to have user-generated
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.120]   forums. So just like our readers can share. It's almost like TripAdvisor, but
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.240]   for smart travelers. I think there's a big need for that. Because when you go
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.800]   to TripAdvisor, it's a shit show. Two reviews, one one-star, one five-star,
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.240]   you're like, "Clearly this person has never traveled before and their
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.560]   expectations are out of control." So on our product roadmap is how do we
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.120]   leverage this amazing community of really smart travelers and get their
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.280]   recommendation surface so people can share. Usually just through friends. I
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.200]   love Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure. But going through Instagram or
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.120]   asking my friends who I know have been places, that's the best way to get the
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.640]   real intel. Yeah, TripAdvisor reviews. The only thing I find myself using them
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.560]   for is I search them if I have a question like, "Now I have a kid. Does
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.040]   this hotel have cribs? I'll go search the review for cribs." But man, when you
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.520]   read these reviews, you're like, "I don't know if I could trust anything
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.920]   here." You know, so many of them are fake. There's so many lawsuits lately
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.080]   of rival hoteliers trashing each other. Because it really does. To get the
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.880]   number one hotel or number top 10, it's valuable. So yeah, it's valuable, but
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.520]   you really just need to learn how to leverage it.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.160]   Yeah. When you're traveling outside of points and miles, do you have favorite
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.520]   travel hacks, travel tips that you use at any point along the way?
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.240]   Well, my 2 famous ones are that number 1, when you're wearing a mask now on a
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.400]   plane, putting your mask around your headphones so that it does not go around
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.440]   your sensitive ear, especially on long flights. You can get like rashes. So
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.800]   people like that. I will just say I've broken several masks by stretching it
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.320]   too far, especially with these big Apple headphones that I have, but it is nice.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.040]   People like that one. My old school is the TPG stab. It's taking a fork.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.680]   Whenever you're eating a salad or opening up a compressed, you stab it,
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.920]   depressurize it so that when you open it, it doesn't splurt all over you. Those
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.960]   are my 2 hacks for travel.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.120]   so much more. But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   situation, which actually gets harder as you build your wealth. So I want to
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.680]   introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle. Long Angle is a community of high
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.600]   net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything from technology, finance,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.240]   medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more. I'm a member of
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.920]   Long Angle. I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.000]   the founders, Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.600]   alternative investments. Now, the majority of Long Angle members are
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.840]   first-generation wealth, young, highly successful individuals who join the
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   community to share knowledge and learn from each other in a confidential,
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.560]   unbiased setting. On top of that, members also get access to some unique
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.640]   private market investment opportunities. Like I said, I'm a member, and I've
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.920]   gotten so much value from the community because you're getting advice and
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.080]   feedback from people in a similar situation to you on everything from your
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.560]   investment portfolio to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.040]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online, so if
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.880]   you have more than $2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle, and it's
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.160]   totally free to join. Just go to longangle.com to learn more, and if you

[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.520]   Anything you do, you know, in a first day in a city that you haven't been to
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:24.720]   before? I mean, I love to just walk around. I mean, I always will eat, you
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.920]   know, find a good... Like, I'm not a good person when hangry, but yeah,
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.400]   usually just get a good meal, walk around, you know, on Instagram, see what
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.000]   people are recommending. And the cool thing is people who follow me run
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.280]   restaurants or, you know, when I went to Dallas, the coolest restaurant is
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.520]   Monarch Room. It's on the 50th floor, booked up, but like the owners of the
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.080]   restaurant were like, "Hey, come tonight." I'm like, "Okay." So I'm a little bit
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.960]   of a lazy traveler, and I'll be like, "Let me see what opportunity lands in
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.920]   the lap," and just meeting up with interesting people. I mean, some people
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.840]   think I'm crazy for meeting people off of Instagram, but I've got a cool
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.600]   follower, so I've never, to this day, haven't had a bad meetup yet. And, you
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.160]   know, meeting a local, it changes the experience completely.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.560]   Yeah, and you don't have to be a celebrity, right? My wife and I went to,
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.320]   we'd backpacked for seven months, and we were using couch surfing. And every
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.600]   night, you know, before we had points, before we were doing anything, and it
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.080]   was amazing to just hang out with locals. And you can do that by couch
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.280]   surfing. You could do that with sites like, I think it's With Locals is one.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.640]   There's a bunch of sites where you can book a local tour guide all the way up
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.840]   until, you know, where you are, where you could just say who's around and,
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.800]   you know, filter the list. Any advice as someone who's gone from writing
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.880]   about points to notoriety in the space for me, as this podcast has been taking
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.360]   off like crazy, what do I need to think about as I kind of move up in the world
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.600]   of points and miles towards the direction you're at? I'll never be the
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.400]   points guy, but...
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.000]   Well, I mean, I would just say, I still read comments, emails. I know it can
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.600]   get, you know, especially when you have a lot on your plate, I just never lose
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.920]   touch of, like, the pulse of what your original audience wants. Also know that
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.360]   you have to evolve, and people will probably not be happy when you evolve
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.600]   from what you started originally. I had to learn a long time ago, people, oh,
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.080]   you're a sellout. You're just doing this to make money. And I'm like, that's not
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.640]   the only reason I'm doing it, but what's wrong with making money? What's wrong
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.160]   with having a vision to have bigger impact? We actually turned the comments
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.200]   off on the points guide throughout the pandemic because there was just so much
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.840]   hate and vitriol. Come up with your own policy and stance for that. Like, I
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.120]   think in general, the community, the points and miles and travelers are good
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.400]   people, but there's just freaks out there that are, you know, the trolls that
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.160]   just want to be nasty. And I, you know, I have a policy on my personal
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.520]   Instagram. Like, if you say anything nasty, if you just start being a
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.800]   negative person, and a lot of times I'll go through, like, DMs, and I'll just
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.080]   see that person just constantly says negative things. Like, this is a bad
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:57.280]   person. You have no right to be in my sphere. You know, I don't owe anyone
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.560]   anything. I give a lot, I'll share and help people, but I block instantly with
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.480]   zero regrets if someone's being a jerk. So, I don't know. I mean, it's fun to
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.080]   grow a business. You've done it before. You've sold a business. But just have
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.640]   fun with it. Never lose sight of, like, why you started it in the first place.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.360]   Yeah, I think that's great advice. The one thing I'm jealous about is when you
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.560]   run a website, you know, obviously, if you turn comments off during the
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.040]   pandemic, it's different. But when you have a newsletter, when you have a
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.200]   website, it's easy to have a two-way channel. And podcasts are very difficult,
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.600]   right? Every episode, I give our listeners an email address and lots of
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.280]   people write in. And I love it. I read every message. I try to make sure if I
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.400]   haven't answered a question you've sent, it's probably because I'm saving it for
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.640]   a Q&A episode. And so, I'm trying to build that two-way channel so we can
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.320]   have a dialogue and I could really get to understand the audience. And, you
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.240]   know, I'm sure we're going to turn ads on because it turns out this is a lot of
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   work and finding guests, prepping for interviews. And if I'm one day going to
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.040]   do that full-time, you know, I have to live too. I'm going to just like...
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.320]   And I think your real fans, though, will respect that. And truly, the minute I
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.000]   started making more money on The Point Sky, I expanded the business. I hired
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.080]   people and it benefited everyone versus just having the Brian blog, right? I
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.160]   think we all overthink as creators. We overthink those decisions like turning
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.840]   on monetization and I'm going to cannibalize what I built and break... It's
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.560]   like so much of that is in our heads, you know? Like, people... If you're
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.080]   creating good content, you should get paid for that and you should not feel
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.280]   bad about it. Period.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:36.000]   Yep. So expect... It might even be... This episode might even be the first one
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   with an ad. Who knows? A few kind of rapid-fire questions towards the end.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.240]   Travel insurance. What do you think?
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:47.200]   I personally don't do travel insurance unless, you know, nowadays like Bahamas
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   will make you pay for it. I'll gladly pay. But in general, I book all my travel
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.120]   with Amex. I highly recommend using a card with travel protections. You know,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   years ago, I was in Bali when the volcano was about to explode and I was like,
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.200]   "Okay, I got to get out of here." I actually booked a private jet in the
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.760]   city because it had accident, you know, crazy insurance on it. I got reimbursed
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.840]   the 20 grand for the private jet that got me to Jakarta, which was pretty
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.440]   awesome. So I don't know. And I have so many miles and points. I redirect
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.600]   myself. I think if you're going on a cruise with 20 family members and
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   spending 100 grand and you want that extra protection. But in general, the type
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.560]   of coverage that cancel for any reason is super expensive. You know, you're not
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.280]   going to get back at most 75% of the cost of the trip. So look at what do you
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.680]   think the odds are of this trip going haywire. So I think there are good
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.320]   policies, but short answer is I don't really purchase it.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.800]   Yeah. For someone who's learning the points game, ready to start using some
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.520]   points, let's assume the world's fully open. What are your top kind of two to
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.800]   three award redemption slash destinations?
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.800]   So one of the things I'll say if you're new to the game is learn how to search
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.960]   for availability. You know, we have expert flyer, which we own, which will
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.040]   help set alerts if certain availability opens up, but also last minute airlines
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.640]   open up tons of space. So if you have flexibility, keep checking last minute
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.840]   and then go on a trip when space opens up. I mean, I'm a scuba diver and who
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.720]   doesn't love an amazing beach. And I think in the points and miles world,
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.680]   it's like Tahiti and Maldives are like the two kind of, I think Maldives are
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.000]   number one in terms of like the dream redemption. There's so many good points
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.560]   hotels. I love Waldorf Astoria, St. Regis, Ritz-Carlton Maldives, Park Heights,
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.720]   a little bit older, but charming, but not, not up to the caliber of the
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.600]   others, all pretty good uses of points. And yes, it takes forever to get there,
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.120]   but fly Emirates, Qatar using miles and the journey becomes fun. If you've
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   never flown in a Middle Eastern carrier like Emirates or Qatar, they're amazing.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.520]   And don't think of it as like, it's going to take me 24 hours to get there.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.760]   Like enjoy the actual flight. You know, Q suites are amazing. Emirates first
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.720]   class on the A380 is iconic. Take your shower in the sky, drink Dom. I actually
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.880]   once brought the Dom bottle in the shower with me. So, but Tahiti is also
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.560]   amazing. It's eight hours from the West coast and lots of good points hotels
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.400]   and just so freaking beautiful, but you know, Europe's been on sale this year,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.040]   you know, Air France, 57,500 miles using flying blue. They transfer for most
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   programs to fly Air France business class. And there's been availability at
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.960]   that saver level pretty much any day that may change in November. Now that
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.720]   Europeans will be coming to the U S and filling those planes more. And I,
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.720]   South Africa, I mean, if you want to take a trip of a lifetime, you know,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   United flies are nonstop, pretty good award availability or through the
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.400]   middle East, but South Africa is my favorite just to beauty, natural beauty,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.480]   Cape town, stunning the wine country's outstanding. And then safari is like my
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.800]   favorite. So those are my like favorite destinations to use points. Yeah.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.720]   South Africa is, is amazing. And you know, if you haven't traveled a lot,
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.400]   it's surprisingly easy to travel, right? You know, you, you've heard that
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.520]   travel around Africa can be tough, but South Africa is kind of a different
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.280]   beast and it's, it's amazing. And have you got a chance to go up to Namibia
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.960]   when you're there? You know, I've traveled to a lot of African countries.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.520]   I love, I have not done Namibia yet, but I've done, you know, Botswana,
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:22.400]   Rwanda is absolutely breathtaking. I've done the gorillas twice now in Rwanda.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.920]   I cannot recommend enough, you know, Masai Mara in Kenya, I've done a safari
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.880]   on the great migration in Tanzania. I also love West Africa, Ghana. I've been
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.120]   probably 15 times. We do a lot of peace work with, with a Nobel peace prize
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.320]   winners there in Liberia, really fascinating, culturally rich, very safe
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.040]   places to go, even though, you know, in the media we'll say it's so safe, you
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.720]   know, but you stay in the right places. You listen to locals, you don't go to
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.320]   areas you're not familiar with, just like, you know, in cities like New York
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.880]   or Chicago. Yeah. I think what, what helped me, it's kind of an interesting
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.360]   thing to do before we went on this trip around the world, I went and I bought
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.680]   the Lonely Planet for New York, because I lived in New York at the time. In the
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.080]   Lonely Planet, they're like, Hey, when you're in New York, make sure to put
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.440]   your money in a, one of those belt wallet things that you hide in your
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.880]   pants. And I was like, wait a second, they're saying New York is dangerous. I
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.080]   walk in New York every single day. And so it kind of gave me this realization
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.080]   that basically there's a blogger or a book that will tell you that everywhere
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.200]   is unsafe. And so reading the travel guides for your own city will help you
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.840]   understand a little bit about what anyone can say. Yeah. And so, yeah, so I
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.000]   think all those places, fantastic. Have you been to Cape Verde? For some reason,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.480]   I want to go and I've never been. I haven't, but I want to go to Sao Tome and
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.200]   Príncipe and like all those little funky, I really want to go do Azores and
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.280]   actually United's now going to be flying nonstop to the Azores. I actually
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.440]   throughout the pandemic, I got, I did the Portugal golden visa and now I'm an
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.960]   EU resident. I got it after about a year, I invested like 350,000 in a
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.360]   Renaissance Marriott hotel in Porto. And it qualified me for their investment
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.160]   visa. I have a whole blog post about it and a ton of TPG readers have since done
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.240]   it as well. But after five years, I have to spend one week a year in Portugal.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.920]   And after five years, I can apply, take a proficiency test in the language,
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.760]   which I actually took Portuguese in college. And you become a full citizen
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.040]   and passport holder. So I think it's kind of cool. Who knows where the world's
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.200]   going. Portugal is the third safest country in the world and pretty
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.600]   affordable to live. So who knows, maybe in retirement, I'll end up in Portugal.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.200]   And great weather.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.880]   Awesome weather, amazing food, centrally located to get around places. So that's
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.120]   been a fun, fun little journey for me.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.760]   That's great. Awesome. Well, this has been so helpful. Before we go, anything
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.160]   coming down the road for TPG or anywhere you want people to check out?
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.800]   Yeah. I mean, just if you have an Apple phone, check out the Point Sky app.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.280]   Today, it was a beast to get this app out. We tracked most major airline hotel
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.800]   programs, credit cards. We're going to be rolling out a bunch of new features to
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.560]   make it run smoother, also allowing multiple tracking of accounts. So if you
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.840]   manage your spouse's or kid's accounts, you'll be able to have that. But I think
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.240]   long term, we're going to be adding more and more tools. I want the TPG app to be
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.680]   able to reverse engineer a trip. So if you say, "I want to take my wife and two
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.400]   kids this week of March somewhere warm in the Caribbean, and I've got Hyatt and
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.880]   Amex points. How do I go there from Austin?" And we can reverse engineer and
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.480]   say, "Hey, these are the flights. What about this place in Mexico you might not
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.080]   have thought about or Turks and Caicos?" Because the points and miles world is
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.360]   tough and it's constantly changing. So we want to build tools that actually help
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.920]   you maximize and travel more. At the end of the day, we want people traveling
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.960]   more, experiencing the world. And I'm excited for that.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:57.280]   Hey, everybody. I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.160]   my favorite award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:08.320]   first month of their standard plan if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and use
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:16.400]   the promo code "hacks." Again, allthehacks.com/p-o-i-n-t-m-e or find the link
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.760]   in the show notes. So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning to
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.520]   trip with Points. I know that all of these --AwardWallet and other companies--
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.960]   have struggled to be able to collect this information because they have bad
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.520]   relationships with airlines. Have you guys actually built all those
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.320]   relationships directly so that you're not going to get shut down trying to
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.720]   find award availability or sync balances?
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:43.600]   Yeah, we've created our own platform. I think the difference between us and
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.640]   AwardWallet and smaller startups is that they don't have as many resources. The
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.040]   Points guy, we're part of Red Ventures, which is a private but a multi-billion
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:58.480]   dollar... We've got top-tier security. We've got a huge tech team. So we work
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.800]   with all the airlines and hotels in different capacities. And I just firmly
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.120]   believe the consumer, just like you do with your banking information, you
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.720]   should be able to look at your loyalty information in one place and use tools
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.320]   that help you get the most value. That's our fundamental belief at the Points
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.480]   guy. We want to work with every airline and we'd love to add even more
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   functionality into it. And we've had really good conversations. So stay
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.760]   tuned. But I think a lot of good things are coming in that space.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.440]   That's fantastic. I have it up. I've got my Points net worth, which is a pretty
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.200]   cool number to track. And I can't wait to be able to add everything for my
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.800]   wife's accounts all in one place. Last thing, where can people find you
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.960]   online other than thepointsguy.com?
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.040]   Yeah. So I'm @briankelly on Instagram. That's where I share almost all of my
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.720]   travels, even the trips I've talked about today, whether it's Rwanda or
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.400]   Antigua. I pin them all on my Instagram stories. You can actually see... I'll
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.920]   always tag the tour guides that I use, restaurants that I go to. I know it's a
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.560]   little bit of a wonky format. One day we'll have that into a premium version
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.880]   of the site where you can even do TPG itineraries and restaurant recs, etc.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.040]   But yeah, follow me on Insta.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.360]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.200]   Thanks, Chris. Safe travels.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:17.360]   I love a good Points and Miles conversation, and this one was fantastic.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.040]   So I hope you all enjoyed it too. I'll make sure to put links to everything we
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.080]   discussed in the show notes and to everyone who's been writing in the past
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.320]   few weeks and really since the beginning. Thank you so much. I'm reading every
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   email and I promise if I haven't gotten back to you, I will as soon as I can get
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   caught up. In the meantime, keep those emails coming. We'll have another Q&A
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.200]   episode soon. And until then, I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com. And if you want to
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.800]   help out the show, please leave us a 5-star rating and review. Thank you so
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.280]   much for all your support. See you guys next week.
