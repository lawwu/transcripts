[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.280]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.400]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.880]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here on my journey to find
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.680]   All The Hacks.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.520]   Today's conversation is going to be really fantastic because I'm sitting down,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.680]   virtually at least, with Brian Kelly.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.520]   And if that name isn't familiar, it's probably because you know him better as
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   The Points Guy, which is the name of the site he founded in 2010 during his time
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   as a Wall Street road warrior, where he developed his unique ability to maximize
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.760]   his travel experiences while minimizing his spending.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.400]   Since then, he's grown the company into a powerhouse travel and lifestyle media
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   platform through a team of dozens of editors and freelancers that span the globe.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.680]   I know I'm an avid reader of the TPG site and appreciate all the work his team
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.520]   puts in to create such great content.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.160]   In our conversation, we'll talk about travel in this post-pandemic world, the
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.280]   current state of points and miles, and we'll get Brian's take on his favorite
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.480]   destinations, credit cards, travel hacks, and more.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.360]   I know you'll enjoy this conversation with Brian Kelly, so let's jump in.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.320]   Brian, thanks for being here.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.120]   Yeah, I am excited.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.920]   This has been a long time coming.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.120]   You've been a top requested guest, people really passionate about points here.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.440]   I know the last 18 months has been a pretty atypical month for, for travel
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   and things are coming back, so I'll just kick it off.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.720]   Have you had a chance to take some trips recently?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.040]   Oh, Chris, I've had some of my best trips over the pandemic.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.520]   You know, when it first hit in March, I took a hundred days off, which was, I
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.400]   think, the longest I'd ever not traveled since maybe I was in high school.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.640]   And then I started small, like Palm Springs.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.480]   Then I went to the Island of Antigua.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   When that first opened, that was kind of my first international trip.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.840]   And from that point, I just started to go.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.600]   I think one of my favorite trips of all time, I did French
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.320]   Polynesia, so Bora Bora.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   And I cannot recommend enough.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.960]   Go in September, October.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.200]   You can swim with the humpback whales off the Island of Moraya.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.400]   Have you ever been to Moraya?
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.320]   We went to the Conrad in Bora Bora and you know, everyone says, "Oh, well,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.040]   that doesn't face the caldera in the middle."
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.840]   And I was like, "Yeah, but it's a pretty nice hotel."
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.600]   Yeah, I stayed at the Conrad as well.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.280]   I've stayed at the St.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.880]   Regis and I loved the Conrad.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.760]   It was kind of newer, fresher, in my opinion.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.360]   Although if you're going to go all out, you can't go wrong with St.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.080]   Regis, but Moraya is so cool.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.520]   There's only a soft hotel and a Hilton, so it's not as high end, but you can
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.960]   kind of go all around the Island.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.240]   And I did two days of private boat and snorkels.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.440]   And I came face to face with a humpback and her little calf, 20 feet from my
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.120]   eyes, she was vertical looking at me.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.480]   And it was one of those moments of, "Oh my God, like, is this real right now?"
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   So, yeah, and then I did Kenya and trek with the gorillas in Rwanda, Dubai.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.040]   Wow.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.120]   And this summer I did a bunch of Europe trips and Europe was amazing this
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.680]   summer because there were no Americans.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.760]   Amazing award availability at the lowest levels pretty much any day of the week.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.320]   I took my family, seven of us, you know, Sabre level seats on Lufthansa.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.480]   You know, so it was like, it's been an amazing time to use points.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.440]   Certainly demand is coming back and it's getting harder and harder, but, you know,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.520]   I still think for the next couple of years, there's going to be great
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080]   opportunities to visit places that were over touristed, the Machu Picchus of the
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.440]   world, you know, Thailand, James Bond beach right now, my friend is there and
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.400]   it's completely empty for the first time in like history since the movie came out.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.040]   So I think there's still a lot of opportunities for travelers.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.480]   Are there places that, you know, haven't opened up that
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.560]   you're most excited about?
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.760]   I mean, I'm craving Asia.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   Thailand just opened up, Singapore.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.080]   I am hoping Japan, I've heard through the grapevine, maybe Jan one, but for, I
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.040]   think I'll be going for cherry blossoms if it's open, I just, you know, it's been a
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.360]   couple of years of, of no Asia travel.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.280]   So yeah, I think that'll be, I'm hoping by, you know, mid 2022, the
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.000]   world is essentially reopened.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.680]   I found in the couple of trips we've taken that it doesn't feel as
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.200]   unsafe as it might seem.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.800]   I don't know if you found something similar.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.600]   I feel 100% safer in any other country besides the United States for a host of
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.040]   reasons, but even just looking at, you know, and I'm vaccinated, I had an
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.520]   asymptomatic case of COVID.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.240]   I, I got tested recently.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.560]   My antibodies are through the roof.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   So I feel personally comfortable, even if I get a breakthrough
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.040]   infection or whatever, but you know, around the world, people take this very
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.200]   seriously, whereas I think 40% of the country doesn't at all in the U S so that
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.640]   makes, you know, no matter where you are, you know, very widely varying protocols,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.160]   uncertainty, whereas when you go to most countries, you kind of understand what
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.040]   you're going to get and there are pretty strict protocols.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.360]   So, so yeah, it was funny when people were like, travel's dangerous, stay
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.520]   home, stay in the U S I'm like, that was at a time when like my friend broke his
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.000]   leg and couldn't even get an ER room in Florida, in Miami beach, you know, on
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.360]   vacation, he didn't even have COVID.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.720]   He couldn't even, you know, he was in a waiting room for 20 hours.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.480]   So, you know, I think the U S has gotten much better, but you know, I, I don't, I
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.000]   hate when people just think, oh, traveling is dangerous abroad is where you get this
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.720]   scary virus when it's like literally the exact opposite when it's rampant in the
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.800]   U S yeah.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.880]   It's a, we had a chance to go to Greece.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.640]   It felt great.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.760]   It was just good to be out, good to be around other people from other
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.360]   countries and eat other food.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.480]   And it was amazing.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   So I know the pandemic's changed the landscape of some of the rules and stuff.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.880]   How have points and, and everything really evolved since you started
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.080]   and what are you doing differently?
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.160]   So points, I think have gotten more valuable because while most airlines now,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.680]   well, U S airlines will let you change a flight and get a voucher, a crappy
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.760]   voucher that you may not be able to use for the full amount that might expire.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.160]   You probably can't use for someone else.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.240]   It's a pretty restricted currency.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.800]   I think they've marketed it as, oh, book and do whatever you want, but, oh,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.440]   and by the way, not with basic economy or other tickets.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.400]   So on the flip side with points, it's gotten much more flexible.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.560]   You know, almost every loyalty program now will let you change, even if you're
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.440]   not an elite member change, cancel free of charge, get all your points back.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.760]   So I think points have gotten more flexible.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.120]   And if there's one thing travelers need these days, it's flexibility.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.960]   Now it's interesting dynamics because airfares have come down as well.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.000]   So the relative value of points, uh, you would think that, well, you're
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.520]   not getting as much bang for your buck because these flights are cheap.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.360]   Let me just book them.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.560]   So, you know, it just depends.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   I mean, it certainly depends on routes.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   I mean, I've flown Emirates first-class numerous times, tons of availability,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.400]   like I've never seen before and, and not all flights are cheap these days, you
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.080]   know, especially since travels bounce back, you know, airfares in the U S are
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.960]   up 30% in 2021 and, you know, rising going to be above the 2019 level.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.560]   So bottom line, I think points are valuable because they're
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.600]   more flexible than ever.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.280]   Cause you can, it's basically like buying a refundable ticket and getting
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.040]   all of your, your currency back, you know, credit cards, there's still a war
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.440]   out there with huge signup bonuses.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.120]   Across the board.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.080]   So it's an amazing time for consumers to get cards.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.000]   I even helped launch the built credit card, which is the first ever credit card.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.880]   No annual fee.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.640]   It's a master card and you earn points on rent with no fees to any
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.200]   landlord, which was huge.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.120]   There's a wait list for it.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.520]   It'll be fully launching to the public in early 2022.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.920]   But now, I mean, when you look at your spend, whether it's groceries or
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.960]   online advertising, there's so many category bonuses on credit cards and new
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.560]   credit cards, and there's some new cards coming that I know about and can't give
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   details on, but there's some exciting stuff in the pipeline.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.800]   So for points, people, you know, some people are just naysayers and saying the
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.680]   points game's over.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.800]   It's not what it used to be.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.600]   It's just false.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.480]   There's more opportunities than ever to earn.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.320]   And yeah, on the burn side, you might be spending more miles than you did 10 years
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.200]   ago, but your earn rate should be three X what it was.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.480]   So as long as you're earning a lot more than the rate at which you're burning, I
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.560]   think you're coming out pretty good.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.440]   So one of the, when it comes to earning a common thing I hear is people say, wow,
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.560]   you have to be rich and spend tons of money, or you have to have a job where you
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.880]   have all these expenses.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.360]   And if I'm not one of those people, this game doesn't work for me.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.240]   I'm curious what you would say to that person.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.280]   I mean, I would just firmly push back if you have a good credit score, if you're
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:56.320]   not going to be tempted to spend out of your means and mire yourself in debt, you
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.920]   can absolutely play this game and win.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.280]   You know, there's probably 10 major banks that offer credit cards and there's
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.960]   probably five solid cards, which each of those banks, probably 50 decent cards out
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.120]   there that offer hundreds, if not thousands in values per signup.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.880]   And, you know, I've got 26 credit cards right now.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.400]   I've got an 800 FICO.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.280]   And as long as you manage them, you can get new cards every year, new issuers.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.640]   You know, even my Sapphire reserve, which I got in 2016, a hundred thousand points,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.000]   you know, Sapphire preferred had a hundred thousand point offer as well this year.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.160]   So I downgraded my Sapphire reserve to a freedom flex card.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.680]   And then a couple of weeks later applied as a new member for Chase Sapphire
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.840]   preferred banking a hundred thousand points because you just can't have had a
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.040]   Sapphire bonus within the last four years.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.160]   So I was over that.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.320]   So there's ways to keep trading down, you know, advanced people in this game.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.840]   No, the signup bonuses are huge.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.640]   You maximize category bonuses.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.920]   And even if you're an average person spending, you know, a couple thousand
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.480]   dollars a month, if you're maximizing, if you're getting your rent points, if
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.400]   you're making sure you use as little cash as possible shopping through shopping
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.720]   portals, there are many ways to travel and get free trips every year without
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.160]   being a road warrior or, you know, small business owner with millions in credit
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.600]   card spend.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.120]   I mean, obviously if you have those things, it's even better, but yeah, I'm
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.480]   curious.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.600]   So you 26 cards, I play the same game and have a lot.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.920]   How do you keep track of everything?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.360]   And, and beyond just the cards, I imagine you have at least 20 different mileage
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   accounts and you know, that's a lot.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.400]   Well, you know, I had always used a word wallet, which had its limitations that
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.800]   not every program was tracked.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.000]   One of my goals at the points guy was always creating an app that really
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.440]   attract all loyalty points.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.800]   Every major airline hotel, which we just launched, uh, this September, uh, it's
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.840]   out in the Apple store, just search for the points guy.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.520]   Andrew's coming shortly, but you basically, you get your net worth in
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.040]   points at our current TPG valuations.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   We also track your credit card spend.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.760]   We'll tell you missed opportunities, you know, I'm the points guy, but I still
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.200]   will use the wrong card for certain purchases.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.480]   You know, there's just so many, no one person can compute instantly all the
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.400]   different variables and opportunities.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.200]   So that's why I wanted to create an app that.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.160]   That tracked it all, but you know, I've got a similar to you.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.400]   I've got a, uh, eight figure points balance because we run millions a month
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.600]   in online ads through my personal credit cards at the points guide.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.080]   And then we use those points for our company travel.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   And, you know, we don't take freebies from airlines in general.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.440]   We use points for everything.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.920]   So I will say I have so many Amex and chase points that I have lately been
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.720]   going and using like capital one, which allows you to basically wipe off any
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.760]   sort of travel charge, including helicopters or Ubers, or even taxes on
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.840]   award tickets, because, you know, I think a lot of people have hoarded so many
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.240]   points, you can only use so many Amex points, right?
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.720]   Like there's only so much time in a year and.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.520]   And travel you can do in first class to actually, you know, and I know this
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.000]   sounds like such a privileged thing to say, but it really is like, just like
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.720]   finance, like diversifying your points balances.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.280]   So they don't just sit there and grow.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.160]   I think I'm guilty of sometimes hoarding points and, you know, I'm
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.360]   like, ah, I haven't used those points.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.040]   And all of a sudden it's like, well, this, this airline's getting devalued
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.560]   and you're like, I should, I should be using these points, but yeah, it's a
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.000]   problem I think a lot of us face when you think about having points in lots of
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.840]   different places.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.120]   I know that when you started the points guy, you started doing an award booking
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.000]   service for people, helping people book flights.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.280]   Do you, do you book all of your award flights yourself now?
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.240]   Or how does that work?
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.760]   Yeah, I don't use a service.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.960]   So yeah, the points guy before it was even a blog.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.920]   So it was like April, 2010, I started it and it was just a form.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.040]   And I wanted to create a business because I was working at Morgan Stanley.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.080]   That was, I could make a couple extra a hundred bucks a week being in my
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.600]   twenties and broke as hell living in New York.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.760]   Um, and I loved award booking cause it's like solving a puzzle.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.720]   And it was like using the knowledge I had in my head, expert flyer.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.640]   I could do for most people, like what they couldn't do themselves.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.080]   You know, once we got in the credit card affiliate game, it just changed the
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.120]   entire dynamics.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.800]   And I realized writing content to millions of people is much, much better
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.640]   than doing one-on-one consultations.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.600]   You know, things would change.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.760]   It was so time consuming.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.280]   Um, There are good, you know, booking services out there.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.760]   I know juicy miles points pros.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   I do recommend it.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.480]   If you don't have the time to do it yourself.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.000]   I also have a assistant who is a points wizard that I'm very fortunate.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.960]   We'll, we'll do the things like, you know, call and change my, my
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.560]   travel changes by the minute.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.040]   I mean, I'll change, you know, if I see what times of first class
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.720]   availability open up last minute, I'll switch to that.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.760]   I almost always extend or come home early.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.520]   So that's why I always book one way awards.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.080]   And then I'm always just looking for what is the absolute most
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   comfortable way I can fly.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.800]   You know, elite status.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.200]   I do have United one K, but in general, at least that is, you
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.040]   know, when you have so many points, I don't even bother with hoping for an
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.320]   upgrade because that to me is too stressful.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.880]   So, so yeah, it's all about just like maximizing points, but I still do it myself.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.400]   I love, you know, sitting down with a cup of coffee and looking at like, okay, I've
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.720]   got my friend's 50th birthday in Barcelona next month.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.120]   What should I do?
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.320]   Should I stop and see friends in London on the way?
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.200]   Should I try the new JetBlue Mint?
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.560]   Is the studio open?
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.800]   You know, like it's still enjoyable for me to, to piece it all together.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.880]   And do you have that all in your head?
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.200]   I know one time my process was okay.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.800]   Well, I had a Google spreadsheet that had all the trans-Pacific flights, and then I
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.760]   would like group them by Alliance.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.720]   And I would start, you know, searching, searching.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.840]   I remember there was a time where I started using KBS tool.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.160]   I don't know if you've ever had to use that.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.280]   It's like the, it's like this Windows program.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.040]   So I'd have to run Windows.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.800]   Is that still around?
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.040]   It's still around.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.800]   And if you have a Mac, you have to run Windows on your Mac.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.560]   So you can use this tool.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.120]   I remember that.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.800]   You know, what do you, what do you, do you just know it all now at this point?
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.680]   Or how do you kind of keep track of everything?
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   Yeah, I have a running list in my head.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.520]   I, you know, I like to fly different carriers.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.240]   I think it, you know, and I, I generally, a lot of time I'll read our
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   points guy reviews of the airline.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.080]   I think we've got most major ones carried, but especially now post
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.640]   pandemic, it's a whole new ballgame.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.840]   So yeah.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.240]   And a lot of times I'll just let the availability dictate, which, which, you
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   know, if I want to fly ANA and JAL, but you know, JL has got the availability.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.840]   That's the route I'll go.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.960]   I generally avoid us carriers when flying internationally.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.240]   I fly them enough domestically and the experience is essentially the same on,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.080]   you know, so yeah, it's usually just in my head.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.800]   But I, there, you have a bunch of great, if you, if anyone's listening to this
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.880]   and is thinking, gosh, how do I use my Amex points, I can tell you there's
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.000]   probably a dozen articles that'll, that'll walk you through the best
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.520]   redemptions on Amex, the best ways to transfer, you know, I think everyone
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.440]   listening here, hopefully already knows that transferring your points is, is going
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.600]   to be a much bigger win than the portal.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.080]   Is there any time that you actually use your points in a portal or for
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.400]   anything other than transferring?
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.200]   Yeah, I gave up my apartment in New York during the pandemic and I would
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.960]   come in and stay at hotels and I have so many points and I don't want to stay in
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.160]   a booking a war, you know, normal room, you know, especially I have dogs.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.240]   So for example, the only real hotel that you can take to rescues is Soho grand.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.960]   They're so dog friendly, amazing.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.520]   They're not a part of any points program.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.360]   And you know, their penthouse is like a thousand bucks a night.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:28.200]   So I was using 70,000 chase points a night to pay for the thousand bucks so
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.640]   I could stay for free in a penthouse, you know, so it's like, you do generally
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.040]   get value by transferring to United and flying Lufthansa first class for
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   110,000 points one way, but I didn't need to go Lufthansa first class anywhere.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.240]   And I still have zillions of other points to do that, you know?
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.080]   So, um, yeah, I do like fancy non points hotels.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.800]   So using cap one points to wipe off the state.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.160]   So house, you can't even book that through most portals, but you can just
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   wipe that charge off as a purchase eraser.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.600]   And speaking of hotels, so I tend to think that if you want to use points for
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.960]   hotels, it's chase transfer to Hyatt, stay at high end Hyatt, 30,000 points a
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.560]   night, or even sometimes 25 things like we recently, fortunately, right before
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.640]   the pandemic, we went to Japan and we got to do the new park Hyatt, Kyoto.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.880]   It was fantastic.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.960]   I, is there another angle for transferring points to hotels
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.720]   that you've ever found?
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.320]   Makes sense.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.680]   You know, I recently MX had big bonuses to Hilton and Marriott.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.600]   Uh, I did the math.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.640]   So I go to Miami quite a bit and I was staying at the W which was
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.240]   like 80,000 Marriott points a night.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.680]   And there was a 50% bonus from MX.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.920]   So basically, and it was a $2,000 a night hotel during peak weeks.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.840]   So I was doing the math and like 50,000 MX points was getting me a $2,000 a night
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   hotel during these super crazy weeks.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.440]   And I would get upgraded in elite status.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.160]   So I did transfer MX to Marriott.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.680]   I have also for the Waldorf Astoria Maldives, when you can find it for 90,000
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.640]   Hilton, when there's an MX to Hilton, it's already one and a half, uh, one to
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.440]   one and a half, but when it's one to two, 45,000 MX points for $1,500 room.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.000]   Is a pretty good value.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.280]   You know, you're getting over 3 cents per point.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.080]   So yeah, there are in general though, MX is best to airlines and a
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.640]   Hyatt points are extremely valuable.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:21.000]   And now chase and also now built the credit card that you earn points on rent.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.920]   You can transfer actually to Hyatt one-to-one or American as well.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.000]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.600]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.560]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.680]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.640]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:46.280]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one 37,000.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.800]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.200]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.720]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.280]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more 25.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.400]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.240]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.960]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.560]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.280]   You all know, I love credit card points.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.000]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.960]   my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.000]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.080]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.400]   category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.800]   You can also load it on your partner's phone.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.400]   So they always know the best cards to use.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.560]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.240]   credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:28.360]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America, or
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.640]   Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.920]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.520]   Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.040]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.880]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.240]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.120]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.000]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.400]   will, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.560]   I feel like we always talk in the points world about Chase and
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.200]   Amex are like the core tenants.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.600]   And I know, I don't remember how many years ago it was, but, you know,
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.920]   Cap One, Citi, they weren't really transfer points and now they are.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.640]   How do you think Citi, Capital One, and I guess Bilt fit in this ecosystem with
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.400]   most of the conversation focusing on Chase and Amex?
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.600]   I mean, Capital One is really stepping up their game.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.200]   I went to their first new lounge that they're opening up at Dallas Fort Worth.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.960]   Gorgeous.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.600]   Like Peloton bikes, relaxation rooms, really high-end food and beverage.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.040]   In venture, yes, you can use your points for purchase a race or, or
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.280]   you can transfer one-to-one to AeroPlan, even Turkish now.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.880]   There's a bunch of one-to-one partners.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.440]   When, when Capital One launched, they were funky.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.600]   It wasn't one-to-one.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.280]   It was very complicated math.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.880]   And now they've listened to our feedback and they have a
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.040]   lot of one-to-one partners.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.880]   So I think Capital One is somewhat of the underdog, but they've always been huge
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.400]   with that mid-market and sub, not subprime, but the lower market cards.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.320]   And they've really made huge strides in the up-market space.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.480]   Citi, I love my Citi points.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.760]   I use my Prestige for 5X on dining most of the time.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.800]   The transfer partners aren't as prestigious.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.680]   For a while, you could transfer to American, which was kind of cool.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   Their partners are, are, are second tier and even Citi's kind of backing
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.400]   away from the premium, you can't even get the Prestige card anymore.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.520]   I don't think Citi knows exactly what it wants to be totally in the marketplace.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.960]   They've launched more cash back cards lately, but you know, and they've kind
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.160]   of, the Citi Prestige and the Fourth Night Free used to be so amazing.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.240]   They've rolled that back.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.760]   So I think Capital One is rising in the up-market reward space and
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.200]   Citi's kind of in a holding pattern.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.800]   I mean, I, I recommend the Citi Double Cash when people don't
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.000]   want to play the points game, but I, I, I haven't had a Citi card since.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.800]   I remember there was a 75,000 point American signup bonus on all three cards.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   And I remember getting all three in one day.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.360]   And, and that was the last Citi cards I had.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.480]   Well, and it's interesting with the American Airlines new, did you see
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.680]   their new elite program where they're revamping how you earn elite status?
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.880]   So instead of getting away with EQDs and Ms and whatever, they're
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.720]   now just have AA loyalty points that, so you need 200,000 points
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.920]   in a year to get exec plat.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.960]   But you could spend 200 grand on a co-branded card and without
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.120]   stepping on a plane, earn a exec plat.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.840]   So all these programs are really becoming frequent spender programs.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.920]   We've seen that slowly over time as they're adding in these revenue
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   requirements and there's winners and losers with every change.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.040]   If you are buying expensive tickets and spending a lot on credit cards, there's
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.680]   never been a better time to be in this space.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.040]   If you're on a shoestring budget, trying to buy mistake fares and get
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.280]   tucked to your status, it's a lot harder to do that nowadays.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.000]   I gotta be careful with American.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.840]   I have some bad relationships there from, I don't know if you remember,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.600]   maybe, I don't know, 10 years ago.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.280]   It seemed there was a promo with this card called Founders Card and Founders
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.360]   Card gave everyone that signed up for it free AA gold.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.560]   And so the card was a hundred bucks a year.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.520]   And you can't buy AA gold at the time.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.920]   The lower tier statuses have gotten worse over the years.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.840]   But back then, AA gold for a hundred bucks was a no brainer.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.240]   And so I went on Flyer Talk.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.360]   I posted my referral link and probably 400 or 500 people signed up.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.000]   And it turns out the American team that did this deal with Founders Card was
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.400]   just like a guy that kind of did it on the side and it was fine.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.840]   But AA HQ sent a cease and desist to Founders Card.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.200]   They asked me to get removed from the program.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.240]   All the referral points I'd gotten got removed.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.320]   Everyone thought I was scamming everyone.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.840]   And so...
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.760]   I remember Founders Card's interesting.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.800]   Over the years, it's like, we have benefits, but they can't
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.600]   really say what they are, you know?
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.840]   Though this is a reason because they're not allowed to market the
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.600]   benefits because they want people to sign up for other reasons.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.320]   Right.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.520]   So 26 cards.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.320]   When do you think about canceling cards?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.880]   Do you have a rule of thumb that you use when you get a new one for a bonus?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.320]   Absolutely.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   I generally don't cancel cards.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.560]   I'll usually downgrade them to like a no fee version.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.200]   Even the no fee cards usually have some perks that are valuable.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.240]   You know, I look at every card in my wallet.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.560]   I mean, I'm a little bit different.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.640]   I'm in the cards business.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.920]   So it's like having cards, getting the marketing materials, it's
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.120]   like, it's good for business.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.920]   And also I get reimbursed on annual fees as part of being a TPG employee.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:45.120]   We have a cool program, but in general, like if I'm not using the card, I don't
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.600]   want the account to just be dormant though, because they'll close it
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.000]   automatically with no activity.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.160]   So if I can't downgrade it, I will cancel a card if there's just
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.000]   absolutely no real benefit to it.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.640]   But most cards these days have perks that easily out the annual fees on them.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.920]   But, you know, I recommend to people do an audit twice a year, three times a
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.000]   year, and get rid of the ones that aren't holding their weight.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.280]   A reader wrote in and asked, you know, should I keep my Marriott Bonvoy card?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.000]   And, you know, the annual benefit, it's like, I think it's 95 bucks and
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.440]   you get a hotel in a category four.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.880]   And my answer is if you're going to use the category four, it's a no-brainer.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.560]   If you're not going to use the category four, depends how much
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.840]   you spend at Marriott, right?
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.640]   The multipliers on a Marriott card, if you're spending money
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.680]   at a Marriott, are great.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.280]   Pretty good.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.280]   But if you're not, you know.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.240]   So I still have my Southwest card, which is a bummer because I think
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.080]   Southwest has a huge bonus right now.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.720]   A hundred thousand.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.200]   Get that companion pass.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.320]   So if you're listening, but don't do it.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.520]   Do you think it'll still be around Jan one?
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.000]   Well, you can apply.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.440]   Just don't hit your minimum spend until the new year.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.600]   So the points drop, you know, the statement after you hit your spend.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.720]   So you can get it.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.600]   I made that mistake once and I had to transfer some Marriott
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.320]   points to try to close the gap.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.880]   Cause you need it.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.480]   You used to need two Southwest cards to hit the companion pass.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.640]   The companion pass on Southwest is one of the best perks out there.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.160]   Uh, you can read more about it.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   Just Google Southwest companion pass ins and outs, but essentially
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   if you qualify for it in January of any given year for two years, through
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.400]   the end of December, the next year, a passenger applies free with you,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.240]   whether you're paying with points or cash on Southwest, so think about
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.280]   if you travel with someone else, you can change a companion over time,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.160]   but it's an insanely valuable kind of one of those insider things that.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.280]   People, if you fly Southwest, you should know about the companion
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.520]   pass and you can qualify.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.840]   You don't have to fly a hundred flights.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.760]   You can qualify via credit card, sign up bonus and spend.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.120]   And when the signup bonuses are like a hundred thousand, you only need to
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.840]   spend like 10,000 or less to get this amazing benefit, just make sure if
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.200]   you're, if you're going to go for this next year, which means buy one,
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.040]   get one free 2022 and 2023.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.240]   And by the way, that works with points.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.280]   So when you use those a hundred thousand points to book flights,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.680]   you still get a free companion.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.400]   Uh, just pay the $5 TSA fee.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:05.800]   It's amazing.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.280]   Exactly.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.240]   So if you're doing that, don't hit that minimum spend any earlier than
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.560]   Jan one or you'll lose a whole year of it.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.760]   Any other big, uh, signup bonuses or cool deals right now?
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.440]   I mean, I think there's, there are a ton.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.840]   I mean, there's just so many perks over the pandemic, you know, credit card
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.080]   companies have added tons of perks to cards, trying to think if there's any
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.920]   one in particular or any new perks you're excited about, well, I mean,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.240]   definitely these capital one lounges.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.000]   They haven't announced who will get access to them, but just seeing the
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.680]   lounge, there's going to be one in Denver and DC in 2022, the Dallas
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.640]   one opens November, 2021.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.120]   That I'm excited about.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   What about some of these crazy aspirational cards?
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.440]   Everyone in this game always is like, ah, that Amex black, that Amex black.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.800]   And then I had a friend who got it and he's like, you know what?
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.080]   Like the way I spend, I don't know if it's worth it.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.640]   What do you think of the high end cards?
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.560]   So I've had the Centurion card for five years now, but the key is
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.960]   get the business Centurion.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.600]   The personal Centurion is horrible.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.680]   It's literally worse than a platinum card.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.160]   Unless you really value Equinox membership.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.080]   The reason the business Centurion is so valuable, they don't advertise it.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.520]   Well, they don't advertise the cards at all.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.800]   Is that you get a 50% rebate on pay with points, which means your Amex
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:28.240]   points are worth 2 cents each towards buying flights through the Amex portal.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.600]   And Amex travel has also has discounted business class fares that
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.680]   are fully more reflect, more flexible.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.520]   So, you know, with an Amex platinum, your points are worth 1 cent business
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.960]   platinum, they're worth 1.35 cents per point.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.200]   And with this Centurion, you're getting 2 cents per point in value.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.840]   So it really, if you have tons of Amex points and you'd like the flexibility
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.920]   to buy whatever the flight you want, you earn elite miles on those flights.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.040]   That's the no brainer, you know, Centurion it's $5,000 a year.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.840]   Now you get top tier access to Equinox.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.200]   Well, if you don't live in a city where there's an Equinox or, you
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.040]   know, that's a $0 benefit.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   So there's a bunch of other perks.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.840]   I mean, in general, my Amex concierge, Ray, the way I value it is that he's our
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.880]   booker for all TPG kind of high-end travel.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.320]   And during the pandemic, when shit hit the fan and you couldn't even get
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.800]   through to a airline for credits and things like that, I just email Ray and
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.400]   say, cancel these four tickets.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.520]   We get full refunds, you know, you have the backing of Amex at you.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.760]   And there's a value to that.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.240]   The purchase protection is insane.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.600]   Anything I break, even if it's my fault, they'll pretty
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.000]   much just wipe off my charge.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.600]   So there's yes, points are one side of the equation, but when you look at
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   these super premium cards, you really have to look at the perks and your
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.200]   personal, you know, Centurion lounges are super crowded and, you know, you'll
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.360]   get turned away a lot of times due to overcrowding, but never, if you're
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.040]   Centurion, they'll even clear a table for you and give you vogue.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.800]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.120]   So business Centurion, I think is a winner.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.040]   And if you do want to, you can call Amex and kind of raise your hand and
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.240]   say, you're interested in the card.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.440]   If there's no official way to apply for it though, you know, Amex
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.320]   platinum just raised their annual fee.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.120]   They added a bunch of other perks.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.040]   If you can get value out of the soul cycle benefit, or, you know, people do
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.520]   say, oh, it's a little bit like a coupon book and it's, it's not exactly that.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.360]   I think it's a little bit more valuable, but you should go through it and say,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.600]   well, I actually get that value from this card.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.720]   We've seen huge entry, even after Amex raised the annual fee on the platinum,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.240]   there's still a huge interest in the card.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.360]   They just reported in their quarterly results, huge uptick in interest.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.760]   So there is a market people want to pay for premium experiences.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.560]   So I bet Amex will continue to double down on the premium space.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.520]   Whereas Chase and City and Cap One are a little bit of a step down in terms
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.560]   of the annual fees and the perks that they're offering.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.000]   Have you ever gone too far with all the points and miles game?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.400]   Is there a particular reward or experience where you're like, you know
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.120]   what, you can go too deep down the rabbit hole at some points?
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.520]   Well, I think in general, pre pandemic, I was just traveling nonstop, you know,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.200]   and too much of a good thing is a bad thing.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.280]   Like I was constantly jet lagged.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.040]   You know, I had a lot of work travel, plus we do a lot, I do a lot of charity
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.520]   work and then plus personal travel and it was all blending together.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.560]   And I think, so I think in general, I like overdosed on travel.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.240]   And so the pandemic for me was a really nice way and once in a lifetime
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.800]   opportunity to hit that reset and rebuild my travel into a place where it actually
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.040]   serves me, like, just because I can, doesn't mean I should, I say that to
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.080]   myself all the time now and learning how to say no to things, even though it's,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.040]   Oh, it's Paris is reopening and Air France has business class availability.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.240]   I have to go to Paris this weekend, even though I have four other plans next
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.760]   week and I know I'll be exhausted.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.080]   So I think in general, I've never been a crazy miles and points, uh,
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.240]   person in terms of the gray areas, even mileage running.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.000]   I've only really ever done one or two mileage runs in my life.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.840]   I'm not the type to fly to Australia and turn around and fly back to me.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.800]   That just, it really is crazy.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.960]   And luckily I find enough where I don't have to do that.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.120]   I understand why people do, and I'm not judging it, but I try to keep the,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   the points and miles addiction, uh, to a minimum and realize my personal
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.160]   physical health is far more valuable than any point or mile.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.280]   Absolutely.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.280]   And I think I'm similar to you in that over the time, as you learn the points
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.120]   game and you maximize points, elite status just matters less.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.680]   And so I think I have my silver United through Marriott, which is basically
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.720]   I get a free check bag, which we have a kid now, so I never thought check bags
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.880]   mattered, and then you had a child and I'm like, uh, can I check six bags?
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.560]   How do I set the, you know, I got a crib and a car seat and all this stuff.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.960]   Do you, do you ever check bags?
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.160]   I do, you know, it annoys me.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.840]   I was in Europe for like two weeks this summer.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.080]   I just couldn't, they were like different climates beach.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.880]   And so I will check it back.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.280]   It is so annoying though.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.680]   I hate myself when I do it.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.280]   Cause you know, I was flying from Ibiza to Milan on easy jet and I'm
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.920]   like, whatever, I'll just pay to check the bag.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.600]   Well, of course there's like a strike in Italy, an air traffic,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.120]   strike flights delayed nine hours.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.160]   I'm like, no way in hell.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.640]   Am I going to sit at this crowded, horrible airport for nine hours?
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.280]   So great.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.640]   I'm just going to rebook myself.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.480]   Oh crap.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.600]   My bag is on the plane.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.880]   I go and easy jet has no employees anywhere.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.640]   So I'm like, okay, well I'll just go back to the checking counter and someone
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.400]   there will have to figure it out.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.880]   Well, easy jet has like two flights a day out of Ibiza and the same employee
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.280]   that works at was working the a hundred person long line that I've refused to
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.360]   wait in, but now I'm like past security.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.560]   So I ended up getting it.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.840]   I had to get like a cop in the airport to help get an airport manager that
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.120]   they pulled the bag off the plane.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.840]   But you know, especially nowadays travel goes wrong so often, you
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.920]   know, delays cancellations, you really limit yourself when you check a bag
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.520]   because you can't just pop off a plane.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.040]   Oh, there's another flight to Chicago across the hall.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.520]   I'm going to hop on that, which is the joy of miles and points, especially
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.280]   you can be sitting on a plane and rebook yourself, but long story short,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.040]   like if I'm going on a long trip, you know, I like to have different looks
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.680]   every day on vacation and you know, when you're in the social media, I, people
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.720]   will call you out for wearing the same thing over and over, so maybe I should
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.800]   probably stop caring about that.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.800]   I mean, we just went on a flight this past weekend to Austin and
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.760]   everything was delayed.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.280]   We get to the airport and they're like, Hey, you're going to miss your
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.720]   connection and we were like, Oh, but there's a nonstop.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.000]   Can we just get on the nonstop?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.360]   They're like, well, you know, it's oversold, but 28 people haven't checked
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.000]   in and I was feeling good and they're like, there there's two people ahead of
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.520]   you and they called them up first and they were like, did you check bags?
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.160]   They're like, yes.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.920]   And they're like, sorry.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.320]   And then they called us.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.080]   So, you know, that was the one where I was feeling pretty good.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.680]   We didn't check bags because we were managed to get out.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.840]   I just, I was just spending time with the senior airline exec and we're
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.200]   talking about this topic and he's like, honestly, when I interview people,
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.640]   I ask them, do you check a bag?
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.680]   And if they say yes, they don't get the job.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.360]   It's cold.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.520]   Of course you mentioned earlier using the MX concierge.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.320]   When you travel, how do you collect information?
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.120]   I know TBG has a ton of great content on airlines, hotels, but what about
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.440]   when you're figuring out what to do somewhere, where to eat, are there
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.320]   sources or concierges or anything you use?
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.080]   It's awesome.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.680]   I mean, I Instagram for me is so amazing.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.600]   Last week I went to Dallas for the first time in a couple of years.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.280]   And I know Dallas has a pretty good food scene.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.880]   So as I was boarding at Newark, I said, all right, off to Dallas,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.840]   like, what do you got?
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.120]   And like hundreds and hundreds of messages come in.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.160]   And I just kind of sourced, like you see the patterns and my
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.440]   readers have really good taste.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.360]   So like, I've never gotten bad recommendations.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.960]   Now what we want to do at TPG.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.120]   So we just bought lonely planet during the, uh, about a year or so ago.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.160]   So we envisioned the points guy being getting you there, lonely planet,
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.320]   really diving deep into cool experiences.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.080]   So lonely planet's about to relaunch really cool new branding and lots of
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:11.200]   investment into what to do when you're there, but I think we can do more at TPG
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:11.680]   as well.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.360]   I'd love to have like user generated forums.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.800]   So just like, you know, our readers can share and it's almost like trip
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.040]   advisor, but for like smart travelers, I think there's a big need for that.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.960]   Cause like when you go to trip advisor, it's a shit show, you know, two reviews,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.200]   one, one star, one five star.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.600]   You're like, clearly this person has never traveled before and their
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.000]   expectations are out of control.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.840]   So on our product roadmap is how do we leverage this amazing community of
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.240]   really smart travelers and get their recommendation surface so people can
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.400]   share usually just through friends.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.440]   I love Conde Nast traveler, travel and leisure, but going through Instagram
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.360]   or asking my friends who I know have been places, that's like the best way
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.320]   to get, get the real Intel.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.520]   Trip advisor reviews.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.520]   The only thing I find myself using them for is I search them.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.080]   If I have a question, like now we have a kid, does this hotel have cribs?
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.800]   I'll go search the review for cribs.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.080]   But man, when you read these reviews, you're like, I don't know if I
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.160]   could trust anything here.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.240]   And when you know, so many of them are fake, you know, so many lawsuits lately
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.040]   of rival hotel is trashing each other.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.160]   Cause it really does to get the number one hotel or number of top 10.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.560]   It's valuable.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.680]   So yeah, it's valuable, but you really just need to learn how to.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.760]   To leverage it.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:23.600]   Yep.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.840]   When you're traveling outside of points and miles, do you have favorite travel
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.880]   hacks, travel tips that you use at any point along the way?
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.160]   Well, my two famous ones are the, uh, number one, when you're wearing a mask
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.440]   now on a plane, putting your mask around your headphones so that it does not go
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.120]   around your sensitive ear, you know, especially on long flights, you can get
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.400]   like rashes, so people like that.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.920]   I will just say I've broken several masks by stretching it too far, especially
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.200]   with these big Apple headphones that I have, but it is nice and people like that
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.080]   one, my old school is the TPG stab.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.400]   It's taking a fork.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.000]   Whenever you're eating a salad or opening up a compressed, you stab it.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.800]   Depressurize it so that when you open it, it doesn't splurge all over you.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.320]   Those are, those are my two hacks for travel.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.640]   actually so good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.520]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.520]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:29.600]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:35.040]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:40.280]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.160]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.320]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.640]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.880]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.600]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.760]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.400]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.000]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.280]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.720]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.560]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.520]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.160]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee, and for a limited
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.600]   time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples at my

[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.400]   great addition to your New Year routine, and I am so excited to be partnering

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.640]   Anything you do, you know, in a first day in a city that you haven't been to before?
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.360]   I mean, I love to just walk around.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:32.040]   I mean, I always will eat, you know, find a good, like I'm not a good person when
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.320]   hangry, but yeah, usually just get a good meal, walk around, you know, on Instagram,
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.280]   see what, what people are recommending.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.880]   And the cool thing is people who follow me run restaurants or, you know, when I
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.760]   went to Dallas, the coolest restaurant is Monarch Room.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.600]   It's on the 50th floor, booked up, but like the owners of the restaurant were
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.400]   like, Hey, come tonight.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:50.960]   I'm like, okay.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.160]   So I'm a little bit of a lazy traveler and I'll be like, let me see what opportunity
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.880]   lands in the lap and just meeting up with interesting people.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.680]   I mean, some people think I'm crazy for meeting people off of Instagram, but
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.000]   I've, there's a, I've got a cool follower.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.520]   So I've never, to this day, I haven't had a bad meetup yet.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.920]   And you know, meeting a local, it changes the experience completely.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.760]   Yeah, and you don't have to be a celebrity, right?
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.960]   My wife and I went to, we'd backpack for seven months and we were using couch
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.560]   surfing and every night, you know, before we had points before we're doing anything.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.680]   And it was amazing to just hang out with locals.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.200]   And you can do that by couch surfing.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.320]   You could do that with sites.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.000]   Like, I think it's with locals is one, there's a bunch of sites where you can
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.800]   book a local tour guide all the way up until, you know, where you are, where you
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.200]   could just say who who's around and, you know, filter the list, any advice as
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.000]   someone who's gone from writing about points to notoriety in the space for me,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.920]   as this podcast has been taking off like crazy, what do I need to think about as
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.680]   I kind of move up in, in the world of, of points and miles towards the direction
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.160]   you're at, maybe never, I'll never be the points guy, but.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.320]   Well, I mean, I would just say, I still read comments, emails.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.600]   I know it can get, you know, especially when you have a lot on your plate.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.920]   I just never lose touch of like the pulse of what your original audience wants.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.680]   Also know that you have to evolve and people will probably not be happy when you
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   evolve from what you started originally.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.320]   I had to learn a long time ago, people, Oh, you're a sellout.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.160]   You're just doing this to make money.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.880]   And I'm like, that's not the only reason I'm doing it, but
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.000]   what's wrong with making money?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.720]   What's wrong with having a vision to have bigger impact.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.600]   We actually turned the comments off on the points guide throughout the pandemic
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.720]   because there was just so much hate and vitriol come up with your
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.320]   own policy and stands for that.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.720]   Like, I think in general, the community, the points and miles
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.320]   and travelers are good people.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.960]   But there's just freaks out there that are, you know, the trolls
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.880]   that just want to be nasty.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.440]   And I, you know, I have a policy on my personal Instagram.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.600]   Like if you say anything nasty, if you just are being a negative
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.680]   person and a lot of times I'll go through like DMS and I'll just see
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.200]   that person just constantly says negative things like this is a bad person.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.440]   You have no right to be in my sphere.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.640]   You know, I don't owe anyone anything.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.720]   I give a lot.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.640]   I'll share and help people, but I block instantly with zero
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.160]   regrets if someone's being a jerk.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.680]   So I don't know.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.000]   I mean, it's been, uh, it's fun to grow a business.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.320]   You've done it before you've sold a business and, but just have fun with it.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.400]   Never, never lose sight of like why you started it in the first place.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.880]   Yeah, I think that's great advice.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.120]   The one thing I'm jealous about is when you run a website, you know, obviously
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.880]   if you turn comments off during the pandemic, it's different, but when you
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.800]   have a newsletter, when you have a website, it's, it's easy to have a two
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.120]   way channel and podcasts are very difficult, right?
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.040]   I, every episode I give our listeners an email address and lots of people write in.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.800]   And I love it.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.000]   I read every message.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.920]   I try to make sure if I haven't answered a question you've sent, it's probably
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.120]   because I'm saving it for a Q and a episode.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.520]   And so I'm trying to build that two way channel so we can have a dialogue and I
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.840]   could really get to understand the audience and, you know, I'm sure we're
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.320]   going to turn ads on because it turns out this is a lot of work and finding guests,
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.440]   prepping for interviews.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   And if I'm one day going to do that full time, you know, I have to live too.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.280]   Your real fans though, we'll respect that.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.840]   And truly the minute I started making more money on the points guy, I expanded the
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.160]   business.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.400]   I hired people and it benefited everyone versus just having the Brian blog.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:17.720]   Right.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.880]   I think we all overthink as creators.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.160]   We overthink those decisions like turning on monetization and I'm going to cannibalize
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.280]   what I've built and break.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.600]   It's like so much of that is in our heads, you know, like.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.400]   People, if you're creating good content, you should get paid for that and you should
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.960]   not feel bad about it, period.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.840]   Yep.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.160]   So expect it might even be this episode might even be the first one with an ad.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:40.720]   Who knows?
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.760]   A few kind of rapid fire questions towards the end.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.360]   Travel insurance.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.000]   What do you think?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.960]   I personally don't do travel insurance unless, you know, nowadays like Bahamas will
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.760]   make you pay for it.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.960]   I'll gladly pay.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.640]   But in general, I book all my travel with Amex.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.560]   I highly recommend use a card with travel protections.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.200]   You know, I years ago I was in Bali when the volcano was about to explode and I was
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.000]   like, OK, I got to get out of here.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.720]   I actually booked a private jet in city because I had it had accident, you know, crazy
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.640]   insurance on it.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.200]   I got reimbursed the 20 grand for the private jet that got me to to Jakarta, which was
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:15.960]   pretty awesome.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.080]   So I don't know.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.480]   I and I have so many miles and points.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.600]   I redirect myself.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.640]   I think if you're going on a cruise with 20 family members and spending 100 grand and
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.120]   you want that extra protection.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.920]   But in general, the type of coverage that cancel for any reason is super expensive.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.400]   You know, you're not going to get that you get back at most 75 percent of the cost of
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.320]   the trip. So look at what do you think the odds are of this trip going haywire?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.000]   So I think there are good policies, but short answer is I don't really purchase it.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.960]   Yeah. For someone who's learning the points game, ready to start using some points.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.400]   Let's assume the world's fully open.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.560]   What are your top kind of two to three award redemption slash destinations?
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.480]   So one of the things I'll say if you're new to the game is learn how to search for
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:06.440]   availability. You know, we have expert flyer, which we own, which will help set alerts
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.040]   if certain availability opens up.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.760]   But also last minute airlines open up tons of space.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:17.000]   So if you have flexibility, keep checking last minute and then go on a trip when space
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.040]   opens up. I mean, I'm a scuba diver.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.640]   And who doesn't love an amazing beach?
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.960]   And I think in the points and miles world, it's like Tahiti and Maldives are like the
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:31.280]   two kind of I think Maldives are number one in terms of like the dream redemption.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.240]   There's so many good points hotels.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.400]   I love Waldorf Astoria, St.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:42.240]   Regis, Ritz Carlton, Maldives, Park Heights, a little bit older, but charming, but not
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.760]   not up to the caliber of the others.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   All pretty good uses of points.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:52.320]   And yes, it takes forever to get there, but fly Emirates, Qatar using miles and the
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.520]   journey becomes fun.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.920]   If you've never flown in a Middle Eastern carrier like Emirates or Qatar, they're
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.320]   amazing. And don't think of it as like it's going to take me 24 hours to get there.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.800]   Like, enjoy the actual flight.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.440]   You know, Q suites are amazing.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.480]   Emirates first class on the A380 is iconic.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.080]   Take your shower in the sky, drink Dom.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.840]   I actually once brought the Dom bottle in the shower with me.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.080]   So but Tahiti is also amazing.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.680]   It's eight hours from the West Coast and lots of good points.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.960]   Hotels are just so freaking beautiful.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.000]   But, you know, Europe's been on sale this year.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.800]   You know, Air France, 57,500 miles using flying blue.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.160]   They transfer for most programs to fly Air France business class.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.400]   And there's been availability at that saver level pretty much any day that may change
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.200]   in November now that Europeans will be coming to the US and filling those planes more.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.720]   And South Africa, I mean, if you want to take a trip of a lifetime, you know, United
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.880]   Flies are nonstop, pretty good award availability or through the Middle East.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:52.120]   But South Africa is my favorite just to beauty, natural beauty, Cape Town, stunning.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.880]   The wine country is outstanding.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.560]   And then safari is like my favorite.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   So those are my like favorite destinations to use points.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.680]   South Africa is, is amazing.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.600]   And, you know, if you haven't traveled a lot, it's surprisingly easy to travel, right?
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.960]   You know, you, you've heard that travel around Africa can be tough, but South
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.560]   Africa is kind of a different beast and it's, it's amazing.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.480]   And have you got a chance to go up to Namibia when you're there?
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.600]   You know, I've traveled to a lot of African countries.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.960]   I love, I have not done Namibia yet, but I've done, you know, Botswana, Rwanda's
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.120]   absolutely breathtaking.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.960]   I've done the gorillas twice now in Rwanda.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.560]   Cannot recommend enough, you know, Masai Mara in Kenya.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.360]   I've done a safari on the great migration in Tanzania.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.240]   I also love West Africa, Ghana.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.720]   I've been probably 15 times.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.000]   We do a lot of peace work with, with, uh, Nobel peace prize winners there in Liberia.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:49.040]   Really fascinating, culturally rich, very safe places to go, even though, you know,
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.840]   in the media we'll say it's so safe, you know, but you stay in the right places.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.680]   You listen to locals.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.040]   You don't go to areas you're not familiar with, just like, you know, in
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.480]   cities like New York or Chicago.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.800]   I think what, what helped me when it's kind of an interesting thing to do before
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:09.560]   we went on this trip around the world, I went and I bought the Lonely Planet for
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.600]   New York because I lived in New York at the time in the Lonely Planet, they're
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.840]   like, Hey, when you're in New York, make sure to put your money in a, one of those
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.080]   belt wallet things that you hide in your pants.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.080]   And I was like, wait a second.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.920]   They're saying New York is dangerous.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.960]   I walk through New York every single day.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:28.920]   And so it kind of gave me this realization that basically there's a blogger or a book
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.960]   that will tell you that everywhere is unsafe.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:36.280]   And so reading the travel guides for your own city will help you understand a little
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.320]   bit about what anyone can say.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.720]   And so, yeah.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.920]   So I think all those places, fantastic.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.200]   Have you been to Cape Verde?
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.680]   For some reason I want to go and I've never been.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.400]   I haven't, but I want to go to São Tomé and Príncipe and like all those little
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   funky, I really want to go do Azores and actually United's now going to
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.680]   be flying nonstop to the Azores.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:00.840]   I actually, throughout the pandemic, I got, uh, I did the Portugal golden visa
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.440]   and now I'm an EU resident.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:08.200]   I got it after about a year, I invested like 350,000 in a Renaissance Marriott
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.800]   hotel in Porto, and it qualified me for their investment visa.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.040]   I have a whole blog post about it.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.760]   And a ton of TPG readers have since done it as well.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.840]   But after five years, I have to spend one week a year in Portugal.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.360]   And after five years, I can apply, take a proficiency test in the language, which I
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.840]   actually took Portuguese in college.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.000]   And you become a full citizen and passport holder, which I think is kind of cool.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.400]   Who knows where the world's going?
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:36.120]   Portugal is the third safest country in the world and pretty affordable to live.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.920]   So who knows, maybe in retirement, I'll end up in Portugal.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:43.800]   And great weather, awesome weather, amazing food, centrally
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.640]   located to get around places.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.360]   So that's been a fun, fun little journey for me.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.440]   That's great.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.200]   Awesome.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.560]   Well, this has been so helpful before we go, anything coming down the road for
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.960]   TPG or anywhere you want people to check out?
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   Yeah, I mean, just if you have an Apple phone, check out the Point Sky app.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.840]   You know, today it was a beast to get this app out.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.480]   We tracked most major airline, hotel programs, credit cards.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.840]   We're going to be rolling out a bunch of new features to make it run smoother.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.960]   Also allowing multiple tracking of accounts.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:18.400]   So if you manage your spouses or kids' accounts, you'll be able to have that.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.040]   But I think long-term we're going to be adding more and more tools.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:25.560]   I want the TPG app to be able to reverse engineer a trip.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.200]   So if you say, I want to take my wife and two kids this week of March,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.960]   somewhere warm in the Caribbean, and I've got Hyatt and Amex points,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.880]   how do I go there from Austin?
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.840]   And we can reverse engineer and say, Hey, these are the flights.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.800]   What about this place in Mexico?
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.680]   You might not have thought about, or Turks and Caicos, because the
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.200]   points and miles world is tough and it's constantly changing.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.680]   So we want to build tools that actually help you maximize and travel more.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.960]   At the end of the day, we want people traveling more, experiencing the world.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.600]   And I'm excited for that.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.000]   Hey everybody.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.560]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me, my favorite
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.720]   award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.440]   first month of their standard plan.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:13.400]   If you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and use the promo code HACKS.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:20.880]   Again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E, or find the link in the show notes.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.240]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.120]   I know that all of these award wallet and other companies have had struggled
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.120]   to be able to collect this information because they have bad relationships
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.560]   with airlines, have you guys actually built all those relationships directly
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.480]   so that you're not going to get shut down trying to find award
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.000]   availability or sync balances?
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.440]   Yeah, we've created our own platform.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:49.160]   I think the difference between us and award wallet and smaller startups is
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.960]   that they don't have as many resources.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.520]   The points guy, we're part of Red Ventures, which is a private,
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.160]   but a multi-billion dollar.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.560]   You know, we've got top tier security, we've got a huge tech team.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:05.320]   So we work with all the airlines and hotels in different capacities.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:10.040]   And I just firmly believe the consumer, just like you do with your banking
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.200]   information, you should be able to look at your loyalty information in one
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.720]   place and use tools that help you get the most value.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.280]   That's our fundamental belief at the points guy.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.760]   We want to work with every airline.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.760]   We'd love to add even more functionality into it.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.600]   And we've had really good conversations.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.480]   So, you know, stay tuned.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.960]   But I think a lot of good things are coming in that space.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.400]   That's fantastic.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.360]   I have it up.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.160]   I've got my points net worth, which is pretty cool number to track.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.160]   And I can't wait to be able to add everything for my wife's
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.440]   accounts all in one place.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.280]   Last thing, where can people find you online other than the points guy.com?
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.480]   So I'm at Brian Kelly on Instagram.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.240]   That's where I share almost all of my travels.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.200]   Even the trips I talked about today, whether it's Rwanda or Antigua, I
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.880]   pin them all on my Instagram stories.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.960]   You can actually see, I'll always tag the tour guides that I use,
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.000]   restaurants that I go to.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.880]   I know it's a little bit of a wonky format.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.240]   One day we'll have that into a premium version of the site where you can even
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:10.680]   do TPG itineraries and restaurant recs, et cetera, but yeah, follow me on Insta.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.720]   Awesome.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.000]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.280]   Thanks, Chris.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:14.920]   Safe travels.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:21.000]   I love a good points and miles conversation and this one was fantastic.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.560]   So I hope you all enjoyed it too.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:26.240]   I'll make sure to put links to everything we discussed in the show notes and to
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.640]   everyone who's been writing in the past few weeks and really since the beginning.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.080]   Thank you so much.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.560]   I'm reading every email and I promise if I haven't gotten back to you, I
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.360]   will, as soon as I can get caught up.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.000]   In the meantime, keep those emails coming.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.040]   We'll have another Q and A episode soon.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.120]   And until then, I'm Chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.640]   And if you want to help out the show, please leave us a five-star
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.600]   rating and review.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.520]   Thank you so much for all your support.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.640]   See you guys next week.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:58:10.520]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.280]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.480]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.360]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.440]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.720]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.040]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:33.760]   entertaining.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.680]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.400]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.200]   will blow your mind, and it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.000]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.640]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.600]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.400]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.840]   your money and grow your wealth.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.000]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.400]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.840]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
