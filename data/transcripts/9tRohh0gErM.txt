[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.140]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.140]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.940]   Today, we're talking all about fasting.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.220]   And anytime we're talking about fasting,
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020]   we are also talking about eating
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.700]   because we all need to eat sooner or later.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.700]   We're going to talk about how fasting and when we eat
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.540]   influences a large range of aspects of our health
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.560]   and wellbeing, both physical and mental.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.700]   So while nowadays,
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.780]   most people are familiar with the term intermittent fasting,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.940]   also sometimes called time-restricted feeding,
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.380]   I think most people don't really understand
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.100]   how that process works.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.420]   It's sort of obvious that intermittent fasting,
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.680]   AKA time-restricted feeding,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.300]   involves eating at certain periods of each 24-hour cycle,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.160]   or maybe even not eating for entire days in some cases.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.760]   But if you think about it, everybody sleeps eventually,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.180]   and therefore, because people don't eat during their sleep,
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.060]   almost everybody is employing some form
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.900]   of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.380]   What we're going to talk about today
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.900]   is how particular schedules of time-restricted feeding
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.300]   can impact our health in different ways.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.780]   And when I say different ways,
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.300]   I mean, we're going to talk about how intermittent fasting,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.860]   AKA time-restricted feeding, impacts weight loss,
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.740]   fat loss in particular,
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.780]   muscle maintenance and loss and gain,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.080]   organ health, such as gut health and liver health,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   the genome, the epigenome, inflammation, sickness,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.100]   recovery and healing from sickness,
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.860]   exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.380]   So we're going to cover a tremendous amount of information.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.340]   I promise to make it all directly accessible,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.260]   regardless of whether or not you have a background
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.760]   in biology and metabolic science or not.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.040]   I'm also going to talk about a lot of tools.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580]   In fact, I'm going to discuss a number of tools
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.480]   during today's episode that actually make it such
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.660]   that you don't have to follow any feeding schedule
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.860]   or fasting schedule, same thing if you think about it,
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.600]   in any absolutely strict regimented way,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.100]   meaning if you were to only eat
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.820]   during an eight-hour period of each day, most of the time,
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.860]   but then occasionally eat
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.780]   across a 12-hour period of the day.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780]   In theory, that could actually have
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.220]   pretty serious detrimental health effects.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.140]   And yet there are things that you can do
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.260]   to attenuate those negative effects.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.460]   In fact, there are things that you can do and or take
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.540]   that can make it as if you did not eat at all.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.900]   And so we'll discuss what those tools are.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.620]   And in many cases for sake of health, weight loss,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.440]   and performance, making the body think
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.860]   that it did not eat at all can actually be quite beneficial.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.780]   So today we're going to cover mechanism
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.000]   and we're going to cover tools.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.200]   Before we do that, I want to highlight a particular result
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.240]   that was published recently
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.600]   because it serves as a useful backbone
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.880]   as we wade into the conversation about fasting.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   This is a study that was published
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.840]   in the journal Cell Metabolism,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.120]   a cell press journal, excellent journal.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.860]   And the title of the paper is Fasting Blood Glucose
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.940]   as a Predictor of Mortality, Lost in Translation.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.020]   And I'll explain what the lost
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.120]   in translation part means in a moment.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.020]   But the basic takeaway of this study,
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.280]   and I should mention that the first author of the study
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   is Paliyaguru, P-A-L-L-I-Y-A-G-U-R-U, guru.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.140]   Paliyaguru et al, the basic finding of the study
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.900]   is that in humans, higher blood glucose
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.820]   is associated with mortality.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.260]   And in fact, if you look at blood glucose,
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.560]   resting blood glucose across the lifespan,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740]   what you find is as people age,
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.800]   resting blood glucose goes up.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.780]   Now, this is very interesting because for a long time,
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.900]   it was thought that metabolism actually goes down as we age.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.820]   And to some extent that's true,
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.180]   but the reductions in metabolism are not nearly as robust
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.040]   as we once thought that they were across the lifespan.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.940]   However, unless there's something done
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.180]   to mitigate the increase in blood glucose
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.820]   associated with aging,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.540]   almost everybody experiences a gradual
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.220]   but regular increase in resting blood glucose
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.320]   that predicts mortality.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.700]   Now, the title, as I mentioned,
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.660]   is Fasting Blood Glucose as a Predictor of Mortality
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.940]   Lost in Translation.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.580]   And the reason that they included lost in translation
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.260]   in the title is that what I just told you
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.620]   that increases in resting blood glucose predict mortality
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.220]   or are correlated with mortality is true
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.860]   for human beings and for non-human primates, monkeys,
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.700]   but the opposite is true in mice.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.720]   And so I thought it was important to use this study
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.040]   as an example of where studies in mice often,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.180]   but not always translate to humans and to non-human primates.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.260]   So today I'm going to be careful to distinguish
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.980]   when a study was performed in mice versus in humans,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.700]   because it seems that at least when discussing feeding,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.880]   blood glucose, and other aspects of diet
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.140]   as they relate to health and wellbeing,
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.020]   whether or not a study was performed in rodents
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.860]   or in humans can be very important.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.700]   In this case, the results were directly 180 degrees
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.060]   opposite to one another.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.520]   In other words, in mice, resting blood glucose went down
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.560]   and it was associated with mortality.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.600]   So lower blood glucose associated with mortality,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.940]   whereas in humans, higher resting blood glucose
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.220]   was associated with mortality.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.140]   And obviously what we're mostly interested in
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.160]   is health and wellbeing of ourselves, of humans.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.300]   I'm sure there are some people out there
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.060]   that are intensely concerned
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.580]   about the health and wellbeing of mice,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.740]   which you could imagine a few rare contexts
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.580]   where that's important,
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.180]   but obviously most of us are interested in human health.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.100]   So I'll be sure to emphasize when studies were performed
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.180]   in humans versus in mice.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.920]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.060]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.620]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.660]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.680]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.300]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.540]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.420]   and how we see.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.800]   And Roca, which is a company developed
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.760]   by two all American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.820]   has developed eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.440]   that take into account the science of vision
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.320]   and they've produced an absolutely terrific product.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.340]   That product involves glasses that, first of all,
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.540]   are very lightweight.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.140]   Second of all, can be worn when performing any activity.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.780]   There really are performance eyeglasses and sunglasses.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.840]   So whether or not you're sweating or running around,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.740]   whether or not you're working,
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.460]   whether or not you're hiking, cycling, et cetera,
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.900]   you can wear them for essentially any activity.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.720]   The nice thing is they also have a great aesthetic.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.060]   So unlike a lot of other performance sunglasses
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.260]   and eyeglasses out there that can make people
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.900]   look more or less like cyborgs,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.220]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses look great
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.020]   whether or not you're wearing them to dinner or at work
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.500]   or whether or not you're headed out for a run
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.060]   or a cycle or something of that sort.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.720]   As I mentioned before, they're extremely lightweight.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.120]   They don't slip off.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.400]   And that's true regardless of what activity
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.540]   you're engaging in.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.020]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.260]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com

[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.180]   your first order.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.460]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.900]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.160]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.800]   to help you better understand your body
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.740]   and help you meet your health goals.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.620]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.940]   for the simple reason that many of the processes
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.740]   that are occurring in your body that impact your immediate
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.220]   and long-term health can only be assessed
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.460]   from a quality blood test.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.120]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.740]   you can also assess your genome
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.300]   and how that's impacting your immediate
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.800]   and long-term health.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.860]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.480]   is you get information back,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.240]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.520]   And InsideTracker has solved that problem.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.420]   They have a very easy to use dashboard
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.260]   so that when you get your results back,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.780]   it will tell you, for instance,
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.180]   if your levels of a particular metabolic factor
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.140]   or hormone are too high or too low,
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.820]   what you can do, what you can take,
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.080]   how you can change your nutrition
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.540]   in order to adjust those levels
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.740]   and get them where you want them to be.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.160]   This is tremendously useful and takes all the guesswork
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.340]   out of what to do with biomarker information.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.980]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.760]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.560]   to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.940]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.640]   Today's episode is brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.880]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.060]   that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.140]   And in doing so, provide the best sleep possible.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.980]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.740]   about a year or so ago,
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.060]   and it is the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.340]   If you go to the Helix site,
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.220]   you take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.820]   and that quiz asks you questions such as,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.100]   do you tend to sleep on your stomach,
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.160]   your side, or your back?
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.100]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.020]   Maybe you don't know.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.900]   And they match you to a particular mattress
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.380]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.500]   In my case, I matched to the so-called dusk mattress.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.780]   I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress,
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.460]   as I mentioned, it's absolutely terrific.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.240]   Best sleep I've ever had.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.780]   It's really key to get a mattress
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.820]   that's best suited to you.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.460]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.340]   you can go to helixsleep.com, take that two-minute quiz,
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.060]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.660]   And you'll get up to $200 off any of your mattress orders,
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.360]   and you'll get two free pillows.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.580]   If you're interested in Helix Sleep,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.980]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.160]   and you'll get up to $200 off your mattress
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.480]   and two free pillows.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.140]   I'd like to point you toward a valuable resource
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.500]   that's also zero cost and is available now online.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.320]   This is an event that was recorded.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.240]   The event was held by Logitech,
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.780]   and I was fortunate enough to partake in this event.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.860]   And the entire event was centered around
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.000]   how to be a more effective learner and teacher
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.260]   using the modern principles of neuroplasticity.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.200]   So at the link in the caption for this episode,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.860]   you can go to what was called the Rethink Education event.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.380]   And there, I gave a seminar of about 20 or 30 minutes
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.940]   describing the modern neuroscience of neuroplasticity,
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.700]   the nervous system's ability to change
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.500]   in response to experience.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.160]   I focused mainly on human studies
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.520]   and how different structures and different things and tools
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.180]   that one can implement in the classroom
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.060]   and outside of the classroom can lead to faster
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.220]   and more pervasive, longer lasting learning of motor skills,
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.840]   music skills, mathematical skills, language skills, et cetera,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.740]   all based on quality peer-reviewed research.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.260]   So if you'd like to check that out,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.260]   you can head to that link.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.820]   You'll also see an example of some of those tools in action
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.940]   in a music classroom of a phenomenal music teacher,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.100]   Ben Edy, who's a teacher out in Pasadena,
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.640]   who has applied these tools,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.120]   at least to my knowledge for the first time ever.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.680]   Of course, all the tools that are there are listed out
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.960]   in what I call a plasticity super protocol.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.720]   And all those tools can be applied to learning and teaching
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.740]   in any format that you like.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.660]   So check it out.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.340]   It's in the caption to this week's episode
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.440]   and it will remain there.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.120]   It's up on YouTube and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.780]   Okay, so let's talk about feeding, fasting,
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.140]   health, and performance.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.220]   And I want to just establish a few foundational terms
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.100]   so that we're all on the same page.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.940]   First of all,
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.340]   rather than talk about fasting or time-restricted feeding,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.040]   I'm largely going to talk about time-restricted feeding,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   but please understand that time-restricted feeding
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.080]   is just one side of the coin that is a two-sided coin
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.800]   that includes fasting on the one hand, not eating,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.060]   and time-restricted feeding on the other hand.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.140]   I may occasionally say fasting,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.340]   but because fasting and eating establish
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.920]   different biological conditions in the body,
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.840]   time-restricted feeding is the term that I will use
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   to describe the overall plan
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.040]   of restricting one's eating window, as it's called,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.820]   to a particular phase of each 24 hour day,
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.220]   or in some cases to particular days within the week,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.860]   because as you'll soon learn,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.900]   there are aspects of time-restricted feeding, aka fasting,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.300]   that involve eating every other day
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.860]   or eating one way for five days
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.180]   and then fasting for two days and so forth.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.180]   So I'll be very precise about what I mean and why I mean it,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.420]   but for the time being,
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.240]   I'm going to refer to time-restricted feeding
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.800]   as a way to put an umbrella over this conversation.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.900]   Second of all,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.180]   I am going to emphasize a lot of biological mechanism.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.620]   If you've listened to this podcast before,
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.940]   you know that I always begin with biological mechanism.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.260]   I do describe tools of how to implement those mechanisms,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.020]   but I wholeheartedly believe that knowing mechanisms
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.800]   and understanding how these processes work
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.700]   gives you tremendous flexibility and understanding
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.080]   and control over the processes
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.500]   of your mental and physical health.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.300]   Whereas if I were to just list off a menu of things to do
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.280]   and not to do, those will work,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.080]   but those will not give you the kind of understanding
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.380]   that would allow you to navigate through life,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.140]   through travel, through dinners out,
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.760]   through different exercise schedules,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.500]   whether or not you're one age or another age,
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.580]   male, female, et cetera,
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.560]   I'm giving you mechanisms so that you can gain more control
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.320]   over the systems in your brain and body.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.320]   Everything's timestamped,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.980]   so if you want to jump to the to-dos,
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.220]   you can certainly do that,
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.700]   but I encourage you to hang in there for the mechanism bit.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.120]   I will make it all very clear
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.020]   because if you understand mechanism,
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.700]   you are in a true place of power
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.800]   and control over your biology.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.680]   If ever there was a topic that is controversial,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.000]   especially on the internet,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.720]   it is that of diet and nutrition.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.660]   So I'm wading into this with a smile
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.420]   and in eager anticipation of all the,
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.120]   but, but, but this, and but, but that, and wait,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.820]   but this showed that.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.900]   Here's the deal.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.860]   We need to precisely define what it is
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.100]   that we're talking about when we talk about nutrition.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.160]   I'm going to give you an example of a study
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.760]   that was published a few years ago, 2018,
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.540]   by a colleague of mine at Stanford, Chris Gardner.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.900]   So he's a terrific professor of nutrition
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.300]   and has done a lot of important studies
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.320]   on how nutrition impacts different aspects of health.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.980]   This is a large scale study.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.620]   It was published in JAMA,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   the Journal of the American Medical Association,
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.660]   one of the very top tier journals in the area of medicine.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.540]   And certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up there
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.340]   meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.240]   This paper where Chris is the first author,
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.460]   it's Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.780]   looked at weight loss in people following
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.980]   one particular diet versus another particular diet.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.500]   And this was a 12 month weight loss study.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.140]   So it was focused specifically on weight loss,
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.580]   although they looked at some other parameters as well.
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.620]   And the basic conclusion of the study was that
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.300]   there was no significant difference in weight change
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.540]   between people following a healthy low fat diet
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.760]   versus a healthy low carbohydrate diet
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.220]   with significantly more dietary fats in them.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.700]   This caused a lot of ripples in the world of nutrition
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.020]   and nutritional science,
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.380]   and certainly in the general population,
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.020]   because anyone that understands diet and nutrition
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.940]   would immediately say, but wait,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.020]   there are all sorts of different implications
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.980]   of eating one type of diet,
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.100]   say low carbohydrate, higher fats,
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.100]   versus a higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.560]   And indeed there are.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.220]   This study was focused specifically on fat loss
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.980]   and on weight loss.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.340]   So as we discuss time restricted feeding,
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.060]   we need to be very precise about what are the effects
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.500]   of time restricted feeding and of eating
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.580]   in particular ways at particular times,
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.140]   we are going to emphasize again,
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.900]   whether or not the study was done in mice or in humans
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.460]   and athletes and men and women or both.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.740]   But the study from Gardner and colleagues
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.680]   is a beautiful study and really emphasizes that
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.640]   if one's main goal is simply to lose weight,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.940]   then it really does not matter what one eats,
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.340]   provided that the number of calories burned
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.140]   is higher than the number of calories ingested.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.900]   However, anyone out there who understands
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.960]   a little bit of biology or a lot of biology will agree
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.340]   that there are many factors that impact
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.960]   that calories burned part of the equation.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.340]   Some of those are obvious.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.220]   So for instance, amount of exercise,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.860]   type of exercise, basal metabolic rate,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.540]   how much energy one burns just sitting there.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.540]   I've talked before on this podcast about meat,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.740]   non-exercise induced thermogenesis,
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.240]   where if people bounce around a lot and fidget a lot,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.020]   they can burn anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories per day.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.520]   So their quote unquote basal metabolic rate
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.580]   is actually much higher simply because they're fidgeters.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.320]   Whereas people who tend to be more stationary
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.780]   have a lower basal metabolic rate on average.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.780]   There's great science to support this.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:27.160]   Metabolic factors and hormones are also very important.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.360]   Hormones such as thyroid hormone and insulin
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.560]   and growth hormone and the sex story to hormones,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.260]   testosterone and estrogen,
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.000]   those levels will also profoundly influence
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.680]   the calories out the calories of burned component
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.500]   of the calories in calories out equation.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.420]   So if out there on the internet
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.300]   or in listening to a particular podcast or speaker,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.820]   somebody says, this is the ideal diet
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.660]   or calories in calories out does not matter
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.460]   or calories in calories out is the only thing that matters.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.100]   I think it's very important to understand
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.960]   that there are some foundational truths
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.940]   such as calories in calories out,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.960]   but that of course hormone factors
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.660]   and the context in which a given diet regimen
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.180]   is taking place are exceedingly important.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.120]   A good example of this would be puberty.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.100]   At that time in life, sex story hormones
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.680]   are changing profoundly in the body
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.220]   as our growth hormone and other hormones.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.460]   And much of caloric intake is directed
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.220]   towards protein synthesis,
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.860]   towards the production of muscle and bone
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.220]   and other tissues of the body.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.100]   And that's because of changes in hormones
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.460]   that we call puberty.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.560]   So there's no way that we can drill into every aspect
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.480]   of a given feeding plan or feeding schedule
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.880]   that would allow us to tap into every aspect
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.680]   of the list that I read out before weight loss,
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.660]   fat loss, muscle, organ, genome, epigenome,
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.500]   inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.080]   But today we're going to be very precise
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.980]   about how time restricted feeding.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.440]   It's very clear from both animal studies
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.040]   and human studies can have a very powerful
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   and positive impact on everything from weight loss
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.540]   and fat loss to various health parameters.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.820]   This is a beautiful literature that's emerged mostly
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.020]   in the last 10 or 15 years.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.680]   And as we march into this literature,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.160]   what you'll see is that there actually is a perfect diet
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.240]   for you on a given day.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.800]   And that perfect diet for you on a given day is contextual,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.640]   meaning it depends on what you did yesterday
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.920]   and what you're going to do tomorrow.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.960]   So there is a perfect diet for you.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.080]   And today I'm going to arm you with the mechanisms
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.440]   and understanding that will allow you to define
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.160]   what that perfect diet is and will allow you to eat
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.800]   on a schedule and to eat the things
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.200]   that are going to best serve your goals.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.360]   So let's talk about eating and what happens when you eat.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.360]   And let's talk about fasting or not eating
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.880]   and what happens when you fast.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.960]   I did an entire episode on eating and metabolism
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.640]   and hormones and other factors that impact appetite.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   We don't have time to go into all those details now,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.480]   although you're welcome to listen to that episode as well.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   But we can briefly describe the overall conditions
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.560]   that are set in the body when we eat and when we don't eat.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.100]   The key word here is conditions.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.320]   If I can emphasize anything today,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   it's that what you eat and when you eat it,
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.440]   set conditions in your body.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.720]   And those conditions can be very good for you
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.760]   or very bad for you, depending on when you eat.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.760]   In fact, when you eat is as important as what you eat.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.580]   I'll repeat that.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.800]   When you eat is as important as what you eat,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.040]   at least as it relates to health parameters,
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.320]   in particular, liver health and mental health.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.520]   Some simple rules about eating.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   First of all, when you eat, typically your blood glucose,
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.300]   your blood sugar will go up.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.280]   Also insulin levels will go up.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.520]   Insulin is a hormone that's involved in mobilizing glucose
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.320]   from the bloodstream.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.220]   How much your glucose and insulin go up depends
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.840]   on what you eat and how much you eat.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.840]   In general, simple sugars, including fructose from fruit,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.000]   but also sucrose and glucose and simple sugars
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.240]   will raise your insulin and blood glucose
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.280]   more than complex carbohydrates,
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.920]   things like grains and breads and pastas and so forth.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.200]   And grains and breads and pastas and so forth
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.920]   will raise your blood glucose more
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.280]   than fibrous carbohydrates like lettuce and broccoli
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   and things of that sort.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.880]   Protein has a somewhat moderate or modest impact
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.560]   on insulin and glucose and fat has the lowest impact
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.760]   on raising your blood glucose and blood insulin.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.600]   So what you eat will impact how steep arise
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.440]   in blood glucose and insulin takes place.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.980]   And there are a number of factors that are related
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.160]   to your individual health that will also dictate how steep
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.520]   and how high that rise in glucose and insulin will be.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.080]   For the time being, I'm leaving out people
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.360]   who have type one diabetes.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.920]   These are people that don't manufacture their own insulin
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   and type two diabetes is essentially insulin insensitivity,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.520]   lack of sensitivity to insulin,
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.840]   which leads to high blood glucose.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.800]   But when you eat blood glucose goes up
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.660]   and when you don't eat blood glucose and insulin go down.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.840]   The longer it's been since your last meal,
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.600]   the lower typically your blood glucose and insulin will be.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.120]   And the higher things like GLP-1 glucagon,
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.880]   like peptide one glucagon being a hormone
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.560]   that's also secreted when you are in a fasted state
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.260]   or a low blood glucose state.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.160]   It's involved in mobilizing various energy sources
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.120]   from the body, including fat through what we call lipolysis.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.960]   Also using carbohydrates and potentially even using muscle
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.240]   as a source of energy.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   So that's kind of a fire hose of information
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.100]   about what happens when you eat and don't eat.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.640]   But just think of it this way,
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.980]   blood sugar and insulin go up when you eat,
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.300]   they go down when you don't eat
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.180]   and other hormones go up when you don't eat.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.320]   So there are hormones associated with the fasted state
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.040]   and there are hormones associated with the eating
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.000]   and having just eaten state.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.520]   Now, the most important thing to understand
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.480]   is that like everything in biology,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.320]   this is a process that takes time.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.560]   So insulin and glucose go up when we eat
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.980]   and it takes some period of time for them to go down.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.020]   Even if we stop eating,
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.120]   they will remain up for some period of time
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.460]   and then go back down.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.360]   It takes time.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.760]   This is very important because if you look
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.720]   at the scientific literature on fasting,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.940]   on time restricted feeding, it's absolutely clear
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.920]   that the health benefits,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.400]   not just the weight loss benefits,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.940]   occur because certain conditions are met in the brain
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.320]   and body for a certain amount of time.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   And that gives us an anchor from which to view
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.720]   what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.600]   in the body over time.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.160]   And if that sounds overly analytic,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.760]   I promise you this is the simplest and best way
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.500]   to think about any eating schedule or any eating plan.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.740]   So I think it's fair to say that in the field of nutrition,
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.120]   there are a few landmark studies
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.160]   that serve as really strong anchors
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.200]   for building our understanding of what to eat
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.640]   and what not to eat and when to eat,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.320]   depending on our goals.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   The Garner study that I mentioned earlier
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.520]   is one such study in that it says,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.400]   if your goal is weight loss,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.440]   it really does not matter what foods you consume
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.880]   provided that you consume a sub maintenance caloric diet.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.440]   However, I want to emphasize again,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.200]   that sets aside issues of adherence,
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.640]   meaning how easy or hard it is to adhere to a given diet.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.180]   Some people find it much easier to follow a high fat,
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.200]   low carbohydrate diet.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.160]   Some people follow a different diet
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.560]   because it's much easier for them to follow.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.960]   And some people are concerned with mental performance
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   and athletic performance.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.100]   So that study doesn't say there's a best diet.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.420]   What it says is that what you consume is less important
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.600]   than the amount of food that you consume,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.960]   at least for sake of weight loss,
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.640]   not necessarily for sake of health.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.920]   Now, the study that I'm going to refer to next
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.900]   is what I would consider the second major pillar
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.020]   of nutritional studies.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.440]   This is a truly landmark study that was carried out
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.680]   by Sachin Panda, who is a professor
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.500]   at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in San Diego,
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.860]   an absolutely phenomenal institution
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.260]   and an absolutely phenomenal researcher.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.920]   I've known Sachin for a number of years.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.600]   And I want to emphasize that the current literature
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.700]   on intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.040]   can largely be attributed to Sachin
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.180]   and the work that he's done.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.920]   There are others involved too, of course.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.260]   And of course, time restricted feeding and fasting
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.320]   has a rich history that goes back many hundreds,
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   if not thousands of years in different cultures
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.520]   and religions, but the science of time restricted feeding
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.280]   can really mainly be attributed to the incredible work
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.620]   that Sachin has done.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.560]   And I'm grateful to consider him a friend and a colleague.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.520]   And we consulted at length in anticipation of this episode.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.160]   I also hope to have him on as a guest in the future.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.760]   The landmark paper that came from Sachin's lab
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.800]   was published in 2012.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.860]   This was a paper in mice that set the basis
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.920]   for studies in humans that came later.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.960]   And the title of this paper is time restricted feeding
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.040]   without reducing caloric intake prevents metabolic diseases
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.640]   in mice fed a high fat diet.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   So the title tells us a lot.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.320]   It says that what's varied in this study
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.860]   is not what these mice ate.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.940]   It was when they ate it.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.760]   And there were essentially four conditions in this study
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.580]   and the results are absolutely remarkable.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.400]   So I'm going to walk you through the major results.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.540]   What they did is they gave mice access
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.460]   to different types of food.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.840]   There were four groups.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.420]   One group of mice had access to just a normal mouse diet.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.800]   It would not be a diet that you'd be very interested in.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.720]   I confess I've actually tasted mouse chow.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.800]   If you work with mice at all,
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.480]   you just have to do it at least once.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.400]   It doesn't taste very good.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.620]   It tastes like a very bland graham cracker cookie.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.680]   And I confess that I only had the tiniest little bit,
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.400]   but mice like that stuff.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.360]   And if you allow them to eat that stuff,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.540]   what's called ad libitum, whenever they want,
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.980]   you just keep it in their food 24 hours a day,
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.200]   they will eat sometimes
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.940]   and then they won't eat it at other times.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.760]   Or in this case, they also had a condition
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.840]   where they gave them mouse chow in a time restricted way,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.160]   just for a certain number of hours each day,
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.580]   about eight hours.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.280]   Or they gave them a high fat diet that was a separate group,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.820]   got a high fat diet at any time they wanted.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.700]   So this was kind of the carnival for mice
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.640]   because mice really like high fat, highly palatable foods.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.240]   And so they got a lot of goodies and high fat in their food.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.520]   And then there was a fourth group
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.640]   that had access to the high fat diet
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.920]   as much as they wanted to eat,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.900]   but only during a restricted time period
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.400]   of each 24 hour cycle.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.960]   Now mice are nocturnal, humans are what we call diurnal.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.320]   Actually, we're not really diurnal, we're crepuscular,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.460]   which means that we're most active in the morning
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.820]   and in the evening, not so much in the afternoon.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.160]   But nonetheless, everything I'm going to tell you
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.180]   is true also for humans.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.120]   And we know this now from human studies.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.560]   One of the most important things to take away from the study
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.300]   was that mice that ate a highly palatable, high fat diet,
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.600]   a great tasting diet,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.720]   but only during a restricted feeding window
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   of each 24 hour cycle maintained or lost weight over time.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.080]   Whereas mice that ingested the same diet,
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.800]   same amount of calories,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.260]   but had access to those calories around the clock,
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.640]   gained weight, became obese and quite sick.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.860]   And as an additional second point,
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.680]   the mice that restricted their feeding window
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.400]   to a particular portion of eight hours
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.320]   of every 24 hour cycle actually showed some improvement
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.360]   in important health markers.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.880]   And what was even more incredible is that mice
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.300]   that only ate during a particular feeding window
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.920]   also experienced some reversal
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.560]   of some prior negative health effects.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.300]   So this study really lit up the world
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.100]   and got people excited about time restricted eating.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.260]   Again, they used an eight hour feeding window.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.340]   The story around that eight hour feeding window
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.920]   is kind of interesting though.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.900]   Not many people know this
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.880]   because it wasn't included in the paper
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.320]   and there was no reason to include it in the paper.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.980]   Not to out anybody,
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.700]   but it turns out that the reason
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.600]   they used an eight hour feeding window
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.460]   and not a nine hour or a 10 hour feeding window
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.940]   is because studies of this sort are actually quite demanding
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.080]   to perform and require the constant presence
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.700]   of the graduate student or postdoc there
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.140]   to ensure that the food is in the cages at particular times
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.260]   and not in the cages at other times.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.100]   And mice are really good at hiding food.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.060]   They'll even hide food in their jowls.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.420]   And so there's a lot of work that has to be done
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.620]   to prepare for that eight hour feeding window
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.680]   and to make sure after that eight hour feeding window,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.020]   there's all the food has been removed from the cage
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.060]   and from the jowls of the mice and so forth.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.780]   And it turns out that the significant other
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.420]   of the graduate student and or postdoc,
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.220]   I won't reveal who they were running this study,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.940]   forbid their significant other, the scientist,
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.060]   from being in the lab for periods of time
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.240]   that were much longer than the 10 or 12 hours
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.500]   that were required in order to ensure
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.140]   this eight hour feeding window.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.120]   So when we hear the eight hour feeding windows are holy,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.160]   they are not holy.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.540]   And later we are going to talk about how eating for a time
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.620]   that's restricted to eight hours versus 10 hours
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.860]   versus 12 hours, for instance,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.300]   how that impacts various parameters like health parameters
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   and weight loss, et cetera.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.740]   But the eight hour feeding window was actually created
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.060]   because of a real world constraint on the research
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.820]   and the relationship with the researcher
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.940]   performing the research,
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.560]   not because there's anything holy
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.460]   about an eight hour feeding window.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.940]   Now, an important point about when the feeding window falls
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.920]   within the 24 hour cycle,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.900]   it is very important that the feeding window fall
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.920]   during the more active phase of one's day.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.860]   So for humans, that's typically in the early part of the day
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.540]   or the later part of the day, but not at night.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.500]   Put very simply, there are a lot of data now
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.040]   pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.980]   of the 24 hour cycle is very detrimental to one's health.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.360]   In fact, when we eat can either enhance our health
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.840]   or can diminish our health.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.840]   When we see light can enhance our feelings of wellbeing
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.540]   or can diminish our feelings of wellbeing.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.160]   I've talked many times before about this
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.400]   on the Huberman Lab podcast that during the daytime,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.320]   you want to get as much sunlight
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.000]   and other types of bright light in your eyes
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.280]   as is safely possible.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.080]   And then you want to avoid light
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.320]   in the middle of the night.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.960]   It has detrimental dopamine lowering effects,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.840]   can cause depression, cortisol increases, et cetera.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.200]   So when you view light is as important
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.100]   as the light that you view and when you eat
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.980]   is as important as what you eat.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.460]   In this study, they saw something really interesting,
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.780]   which was that not only did restricting food
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.420]   to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.960]   benefit things like lean body mass and fat loss
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.280]   and a number of health parameters
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.840]   that I'll talk about in a moment,
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.880]   but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.720]   and provided a more regular stable so-called circadian rhythm
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.060]   or 24 hour rhythm.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.100]   You may be surprised to learn that 80%,
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.240]   80% of the genes in your body and brain
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.840]   are on a 24 hour schedule.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.980]   That is they change their levels going from high to low
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.840]   and back to high again across the 24 hour cycle.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.740]   And when those genes are high at the appropriate times
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.200]   and low at the appropriate times,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.560]   meaning their expression is high and low
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.080]   at the appropriate times.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.300]   And therefore the proper RNAs and proteins are made
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.760]   because DNA encodes for RNA.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.540]   RNA is translated into proteins.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.840]   When that happens, your health benefits.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.940]   When those genes are not expressed at the right times,
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.380]   when they're high or low at the wrong times
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.700]   of each 24 hour cycle,
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.920]   that's when you get negative health effects.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.240]   This study showed that when mice restrict their eating
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.120]   to an eight hour period within the most active phase
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.600]   of their 24 hour cycle,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.420]   many of the genes that are associated
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.420]   with these so-called circadian and clocks,
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.640]   these genes have names like PER, BMAL, CRY1, et cetera.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.560]   Those so-called clock genes underwent
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.840]   a very regular entrainment,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.240]   a locking in to the proper 24 hour schedule.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.540]   And while this was in mice,
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.740]   we now know that this also occurs in humans.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.240]   I've said before on this podcast, and I'll say it again,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.180]   that light and when we view light is the primary way
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.020]   in which these genes and the clock systems of our body
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.860]   get organized or entrained,
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.280]   meaning matched to the outside light dark cycle.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.740]   So viewing light early in the day and in the afternoon
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.900]   and as much as possible all day, great.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.320]   Ideally that sunlight.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.120]   Avoiding light in the middle of the night is also great.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.620]   It's great because it causes the increases
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.900]   in particular genes and the decreases in particular genes
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.240]   in every cell throughout your body
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.040]   at the appropriate times.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.300]   The second most powerful timekeeper or zeitgeber
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.660]   as it's called is food and when you eat.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.620]   And in this study, the results they saw underscore
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.680]   this point, what they saw is that the peaks
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.800]   in these clock genes became very regular
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.600]   and the dips in these clock genes became very regular.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.560]   And that led to a whole host of really important
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.800]   positive health effects.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.660]   Conversely, when mice ate whenever they wanted
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.500]   across the 24 hour cycle,
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.160]   these clock genes became really out of whack
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.860]   and the negative health consequences
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.220]   were the downstream result of these changes
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.400]   in these clock genes.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.100]   This has now also been shown to be true for humans.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.100]   So if you want to be healthy, you want your organ health,
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.400]   your metabolic health to be entrained properly.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.820]   One of the most important things you can do
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.220]   is to view light at the appropriate times
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.460]   of each 24 hour schedule and to not view light
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.060]   at other times of that schedule
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.720]   and to eat at the appropriate time of each 24 hour day.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.500]   Now, again, there are rare instances that we will discuss
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.460]   when skipping entire days or entire 24 hour cycles
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.940]   of eating can be beneficial.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.320]   But for now we're talking about schedules
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.640]   of time restricted feeding that involve a window of feeding
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.540]   that falls during your more active phase.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.480]   So during the daytime, putting aside people
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.360]   that work shift work during the daytime
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.920]   is when you want to eat.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.220]   And this eight hour feeding window
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.040]   provided a very strong reinforcing signal
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.680]   that combines with light to ensure that these genes
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.120]   are expressed at the appropriate times.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.360]   The short takeaway from this
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.200]   is you probably want to think about
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.240]   and perhaps even engage in time restricted feeding.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.320]   So as I mentioned earlier,
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.360]   when mice can eat around the clock, bad things happen.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.900]   And one of the bad things that happens
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.580]   is that the liver suffers.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.260]   The liver is involved in all sorts of things,
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.840]   production of important hormones and other factors
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.640]   related to metabolism.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.820]   And when mice can eat around the clock,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.520]   their livers got very sick, fatty deposits in the liver,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.920]   other factors in the liver,
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.000]   essentially taking down the pathway of liver disease.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.480]   The time restricted feeding essentially reversed that
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.760]   or led in many cases to even healthier liver conditions.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.800]   And that's based on this study,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.640]   but also additional studies also now in humans.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.180]   So restricting your feeding to a particular window
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.460]   every 24 hour cycle has clearly been shown now in mice
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.880]   and in humans to enhance liver health, which is wonderful.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.240]   How does it do this?
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.540]   Well, it happens because food intake,
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.480]   as I mentioned earlier,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.540]   sets certain conditions in the body
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.760]   that lasts for a period of time.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.140]   Anytime we eat, whether or not we are a mouse or a human,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.340]   there's a period of time
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.820]   that's required for so-called digestion,
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.680]   but also gastric emptying
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.540]   and other processes related to breaking down that food
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.660]   and utilizing it.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.360]   And that is an active process.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.280]   It requires energy.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.780]   And that process of breaking down food
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.980]   involves certain cellular functions
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.620]   that if they're ongoing throughout the 24 hour cycle,
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:04.080]   or even extended too far across the 24 hour cycle,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.740]   meaning you're eating across a 14 or a 16 hour,
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.140]   an 18 hour window that causes serious problems.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.820]   And this has now been established
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.740]   because of the fact that it increases the expression
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.480]   of different proteins and genes in the body,
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.020]   such as TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.260]   What are all those things?
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.500]   They are pro-inflammatory markers.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.420]   So the reason that the liver gets sick
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.180]   when you're eating too often
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.440]   is because inflammatory markers are increased.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.140]   These inflammatory markers are not inherently bad.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.620]   They're there for a reason,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.060]   but they are there in order to respond
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.580]   to certain challenges, immune challenges,
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.900]   or the ingestion of food and the breakdown of food.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   But then in an ideal circumstance,
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.520]   they are reduced in the period
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.340]   in which there's no food present in the digestive tract
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.020]   or in which there's very little food present
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.380]   in the digestive tract.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.860]   So by eating around the clock,
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.300]   you're making yourself sicker.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.060]   By eating at restricted periods of time each 24 hour day,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.900]   you're actually making yourself healthier
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.160]   and you're activating certain processes
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.860]   that can positively impact both weight,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.700]   either maintenance or loss of weight.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.340]   We'll talk about weight gain a little later
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.020]   and positively impacting things like liver health.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.420]   Also the expression of different things
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.020]   related to brown fat,
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.780]   the fat that increases your metabolism.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.180]   We will return to this also a little bit later
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.260]   and blood glucose regulation.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.460]   So the takeaway from this study,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.100]   in fact, there are many takeaways from this study.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.380]   It's so wonderful is that liver health,
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.320]   bile acid metabolism, energy expenditure, inflammation,
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:44.900]   liver metabolites, many, many aspects of our health
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.280]   are impacted by when we eat, not just what we eat.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.260]   As we move forward and we talk about intermittent fasting
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.780]   for eight hour windows, six hour windows, 12 hour windows,
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.660]   for all sorts of different intents and purposes,
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.380]   I want to start to establish a foundational protocol
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.460]   that all of us, any of us can use
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.840]   in order to maximize your particular goals.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.700]   There are some absolutes within this realm
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.740]   of time restricted feeding.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.360]   Here are a couple of absolutes
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.740]   that you would want to consider.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.740]   First of all, it pays off in the metabolic sense
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.620]   and in the health sense
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.960]   and in the weight maintenance or loss sense
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.380]   to not ingest any food in the first hour after waking
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.960]   and potentially for longer.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.920]   So I want to repeat that.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.400]   One of the key pillars of intermittent fasting
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.560]   is that for the first hour after you wake up
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.960]   and potentially for longer to not ingest any food, okay?
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.720]   The second major pillar that's well supported by research
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.360]   is that for the two and ideally three hours
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.860]   prior to bedtime, you also don't ingest any food
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.580]   or liquid calories for that matter.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.740]   And we will talk about what it means to break a fast
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.380]   and whether or not certain liquids,
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.700]   even coffee and tea can break a fast, et cetera,
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.540]   in a few moments.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.540]   But just as a foundation,
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.940]   it's very clear from the research in humans
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.220]   that not eating any food or ingesting any calories,
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.540]   liquid or otherwise,
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.460]   for the first 60 minutes after waking up each day
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:23.840]   and for the two to three hours prior to your bedtime,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.760]   that's ideal for the parameters that we've discussed earlier,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.080]   all the different things like weight and liver health
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.280]   and metabolic health and so forth.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.900]   The two most common questions about intermittent fasting
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.040]   are when is the ideal time for the eating window?
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.560]   Is it early in the day, the middle of the day
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.120]   or late or in the day?
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.900]   And how long should that eating window be?
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.180]   Should it be eight hours?
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.320]   We already heard why the eight hour window
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.700]   was first established.
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.280]   It was because of these lab conditions
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.320]   and the conditions of the particular relationship
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.020]   of the graduate student involved,
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.180]   or should it be seven hours or six hours or 12 hours?
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.920]   Turns out that there's some general frameworks
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.020]   that we can follow in order to answer these questions.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.080]   As we move into this portion of the discussion,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.940]   I want to highlight a very important reference
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.340]   that just came out, literally came out last week
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.020]   in the journal, endocrinology reviews.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.960]   And the title of this review is time restricted eating
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.480]   for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.160]   Although the data in this paper
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.080]   go well beyond metabolic diseases.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.860]   This is a paper from Sachin Panda's lab.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.520]   It's a very lengthy review with an enormous table
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.040]   that's beautifully organized that scripts out
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.540]   all the studies done in humans, well over a hundred studies,
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.840]   looking at time restricted feeding in athletes,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.420]   men, women, children, diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.760]   with detailed references and description of the outcomes.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.440]   Spent a lot of time with this review,
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.880]   even though it just came out recently
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.020]   and is a absolute goldmine resource.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.960]   It is also the major resource for everything
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.000]   I'm about to tell you,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.840]   if you would like to delve deeper into the material.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.940]   So let's deal with this first question
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.500]   of when is the ideal feeding window?
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.960]   And here again, we're thinking about a schedule of eating
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.100]   that involves eating at least once every 24 hours,
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.060]   not two day or three day or every other day fast.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.600]   So it turns out that the answer to the question,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.160]   when is it best to eat is actually best answered
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.240]   by thinking about the other side of the coin,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.120]   which is when is it best to fast?
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.640]   So because we are fasting during sleep,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.680]   it's very clear that it's best to extend
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.240]   the sleep related fast either into the morning
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.080]   or to start it in the evening.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.520]   Now this might seem kind of obvious,
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.240]   but it's actually not so obvious.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.460]   You could place that feeding window early in the day,
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.600]   middle of the day or late in the day.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.000]   Let's think about what happens when we sleep.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.140]   When we sleep, our body undergoes a number
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.680]   of different processes in the brain and body
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   in order to recover the cells and tissues.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.600]   Many of you have probably heard of autophagy,
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.560]   which is essentially cleaning up a gobbling up
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.480]   of dead cells and cells that are injured or sick.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.680]   And this is a natural process that occurs
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.480]   and it occurs mainly during sleep,
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.400]   although not only during sleep.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.380]   Fasting of any kind does tend to enhance autophagy.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.380]   It is not the only way to create autophagic conditions.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.740]   Autophagic conditions can be created simply
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.660]   by following a sub caloric diet.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.540]   And there are other things that one can do
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.800]   in order to trigger autophagy,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   but fasting does trigger autophagy.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.640]   So when we're asleep, the bad cells are getting gobbled up
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.880]   and eaten and the good cells also are undergoing
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.420]   certain repair mechanisms, mainly related to,
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.840]   or at least governed by those circadian genes
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.480]   that we talked about earlier, those clock genes.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.640]   So you're already fasting when you're asleep
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.960]   and how deep you are into that fast depends
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.000]   on how long it was since your last meal.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.220]   So if you fast early in the day
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.380]   and you've been asleep for five, six, seven, eight hours,
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.400]   I would hope somewhere between six and eight hours
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.840]   for most people is going to be beneficial.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.560]   When you wake up, I mentioned earlier
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.580]   that you don't want to eat
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.200]   for at least the first 60 minutes after waking,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   but were you to extend that fasting to say 9 AM, 10 AM,
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.220]   11 AM, or even 12 noon or later,
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.740]   you are taking advantage of the deep fast
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.920]   that you were in during sleep
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.540]   and certainly toward the end of sleep.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.920]   Now, why do I say deep fast?
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   Well, because when we eat the clearance of that food
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.420]   from our gut and the processes in our cells and organs
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.300]   that are related to digestion
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.400]   and the utilization of that food takes
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.460]   about five to six hours.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.680]   So if you eat a meal and that meal lasts 10 minutes,
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.900]   20 minutes, or 30 minutes, or even an hour,
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.520]   and then you stop eating, you've stopped eating,
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.200]   but you are not fasting at that point.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.240]   You can say you're fasting
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.640]   'cause you're no longer putting food
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.480]   into your digestive tract,
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.460]   but you are not in a fasted state.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.400]   You are not under conditions of fasting.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.840]   Later, I'll talk about things that you can do
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.380]   to accelerate the transition into fasting.
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:20.120]   So one thing is certain that you want your eating window
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   to be tacked or attached to your sleep-based fasting
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.260]   in a way that makes it easier for you
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.300]   to get into the fasted state for a period of time.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   So we can view that point from the perspective of best,
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.320]   better, and worst, okay?
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.440]   So if you are like most people and you sleep at night,
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.720]   you're waking up somewhere around 6.37 AM
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.920]   or maybe even 8 AM,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.160]   let's say you were to push your fasting window out
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.640]   such that you started eating at noon
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.560]   and then you stopped eating at 6 PM.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.000]   Well, then you're not eating from 6 PM
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   until let's say your bedtime is 10 PM,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.560]   but from 6 PM to 10 PM,
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.120]   your body is not yet in a fasted state
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.180]   because you just ate.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.440]   However, you're starting to taper into a fasted state
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.000]   before sleep and then all through sleep
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.740]   and until the next morning and late morning,
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.120]   you are actually in a fasted state.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.680]   Now, most people find it very hard to only eat
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.040]   in the middle of the day.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.360]   So while that's best,
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.800]   it's ideal for sake of the fasting related improvements
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   in health, it is not ideal and it's not very applicable
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.240]   to most work and family and social situations.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.460]   Most people eat breakfast with others
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.880]   and or eat dinner with others.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.480]   Some people eat lunch with others,
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.260]   but in general, it's hard to restrict your feeding window
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.340]   to just the absolute middle of the day.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.780]   But from a purely health perspective in a very objective way,
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.040]   that would be the ideal situation.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.260]   Let's imagine a different pattern of eating
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.620]   where the feeding window starts in the afternoon,
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.100]   starts around two or even 3 PM.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.520]   Some people don't have much trouble
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.860]   or they can train themselves to get their feeding window out
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.640]   to two or 3 PM.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.560]   And then they will eat until 10 or 11 PM, right?
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.400]   If you do the math,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.680]   you realize that that feeding window is still pretty short.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.640]   It's still constitutes what we would call
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.320]   intermittent fasting or time restricted feeding.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.200]   But assuming that they go to bed around 11 PM or midnight,
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.960]   they are not actually fasted in sleep
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.360]   because for the first six hours or so of sleep,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.860]   maybe five, but probably more like six hours of sleep,
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.180]   they're still digesting the food
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.720]   that they consumed late in the night.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.320]   It does appear beneficial to grab a hold of
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.980]   that sleep related fast,
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.520]   meaning you don't want your feeding window
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.700]   to be too close to bedtime.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.160]   And that's why we came up with this
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   kind of foundational pillar
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.880]   that I discussed with Sachin earlier,
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.440]   which is at least no eating for the first hour after waking,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.680]   but also no eating within two to three hours prior to bed.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.840]   And because we all need to sleep
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   and sleep is exceedingly important
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.740]   for our health of all kinds, you want to prioritize sleep,
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.520]   but because we also have to eat,
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.460]   then you start to think about this and maybe it's not so good
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.240]   to push that feeding window too late in the day,
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.780]   because when you go to sleep,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.320]   you're not actually capitalizing
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.220]   on the sleep related fasting.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.840]   Now it's not just the case
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.720]   that it's easiest to fast while in sleep.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.560]   Although that's true because when we're asleep,
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.940]   typically we're not hungry or looking for food
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.560]   or foraging for food or wanting food
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.940]   or trying to resist food.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.940]   We're just sleeping.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.440]   There is something special
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.800]   about the fasting that occurs during sleep,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.820]   because it's associated with a number of processes
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.400]   that relate to the so-called glymphatic system.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.880]   The movement of lymph-like fluids
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.320]   and other fluids through the brain
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.580]   are kind of sweeping out garbage disposal, if you will,
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.020]   a clearing out of the metabolic debris
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.240]   and some of the autophagy that's associated
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.640]   with bad processes in the brain.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.300]   So we could do a whole episode on this,
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.720]   but essentially during sleep
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.240]   and in particular during fasted states of sleep,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.660]   we are undergoing a number of automatic cellular processes
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.900]   that clear out debris from our brain,
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.680]   enhance cognition, or at least offset dementia.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.280]   This is now well-established,
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.900]   as well as a number of the same processes
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.860]   occurring in the organs of our body.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.160]   So what we're starting to see here
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.600]   is that there are a number of constraints
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.940]   on when you can eat.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.560]   Now I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.120]   the social constraints and the real life constraints.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.720]   Some of us, because we want to eat with our family
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.700]   and because our family or our significant others
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.120]   eat around eight or 9 p.m.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.320]   and that's the only time we're together,
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.600]   you have to eat late in the day.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.880]   And that's certainly not a sin.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.000]   I'm not saying that's good or bad.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.880]   Here we're trying to establish, if you recall,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.040]   best, better, and worst.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   So from both a practical and a health perspective
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.800]   and a purely objective view
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.200]   of how intermittent fasting works and can benefit us,
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.400]   starting to eat each day,
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.040]   somewhere around 10 a.m. or around noon,
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.240]   and then allowing a feeding window
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.560]   that goes until six or maybe 8 p.m.,
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.780]   that seems to me, at least based on the data
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.080]   and what I understand about typical cultures
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.360]   where people eat in the daytime and in the evening,
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.180]   that seems to me like the kind of schedule
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.240]   that will allow you to get the most
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.880]   out of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.940]   but does not set you up to be really out of sync
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.460]   with the social rhythms in most cultures.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:38.800]   If you think about it from the perspective of, say,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.240]   a noon to eight feeding window,
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.440]   what you'll find is that you're able to eat lunch
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.480]   with others, if you like, or by yourself,
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.400]   you will be able to eat dinner at a reasonable hour,
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.200]   at least in most countries, in most cultures,
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:56.160]   eating dinner somewhere between 6.30 and 7 p.m.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.900]   is typical.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.340]   When you say a feeding window that goes until eight,
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.920]   that doesn't mean sitting down to dinner at eight.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.520]   That means your last bite of food
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.660]   or ingestion of any liquid calories was at 8 p.m.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:12.360]   Assuming that you go to bed somewhere between 10 p.m.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.920]   and 1 a.m., that allows this tapering off
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.400]   or this transition from feeding to a fasted state
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.480]   and still allows you to capitalize
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.520]   on the special period of fasting
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.880]   that is sleep-related fasting.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.700]   And again, I want to emphasize that the fasting
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.480]   that occurs during sleep is vital
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.200]   and eating too close to sleep will disrupt
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.600]   that fasting-related sleep.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.500]   Now, there are a number of caveats
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.440]   and details related to this,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.520]   and there's an important caveat and detail related to people
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.900]   that are specifically interested in increasing
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.880]   or maintaining muscle mass.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.680]   So first let's talk about food volume and food type
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.680]   and how that relates to whether or not you quickly
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.200]   or slowly enter a fasted state.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.760]   Because clearly when we talk about a feeding window,
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.440]   that feeding window could include any number
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.280]   of different foods.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.180]   It could involve cake and ice cream, pizza, hamburgers,
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.720]   plants, fruit, whatever it is,
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.000]   or it could involve just fats or just proteins, et cetera.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.880]   There are at least three factors that are going to govern
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   how quickly you transition from ingesting food
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.720]   to a fasted state.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.920]   Remember, as you ingest your last bite or sip of calories,
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.440]   that's not when the fast begins.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.280]   That might be when the fasting begins on your watch
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.200]   or on one of these apps that I'll refer to later,
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.700]   which can help you track your fasting and eating windows.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.920]   But that's not when it actually begins
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.180]   because your body is still seeing food.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.100]   You're actually carrying around food inside of you.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.160]   Even though you're not putting it into your mouth,
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.960]   you're still eating in some sense.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.240]   So it should be somewhat obvious that very large meals
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.740]   are going to take longer to digest than very small meals.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:58.040]   So that will impact how slowly or quickly you migrate
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.880]   from a fed state to a fasted state.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:05.240]   There's no way I can spell out what exact volume of food
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.240]   you should ingest based on the size of your stomach
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.520]   and et cetera.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   But you're all familiar with being extremely full,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.120]   very full, comfortably full, somewhat full,
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.880]   or not feeling full and feeling hungry.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.640]   So learning to gauge food volume is important.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.840]   Also foods that include some fats or a lot of fats
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.800]   will tend to slow gastric emptying time.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.560]   And depending on the kind of fats,
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.760]   it could mean that a given meal is digested
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.660]   within three hours versus five hours.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.440]   So more fats might be a large meal with a lot of fats
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.920]   has been going to take five or six hours.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.080]   A smaller meal with less fat is going to be digested
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.440]   more quickly.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.880]   Consuming calories in liquid form is going to mean
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.500]   that gastric emptying time is going to be faster.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.340]   And then of course,
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.960]   there's the glucose and the insulin aspect to it,
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.280]   which is that foods that lead to big,
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.580]   steep rises in glucose, like pure sugars,
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.000]   then your glucose will drop.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.840]   However, if they're combined with fats,
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.880]   then it tends to be a more gradual rise in glucose
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.520]   and it's more sustained, et cetera.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.480]   Fibrous foods will also create a more long lasting,
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.420]   sustained release in glucose.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:14.420]   The important thing here is to establish a feeding window
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.300]   that you can comfortably manage, okay?
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.800]   Meaning that on average,
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.840]   you can obey a six hour feeding window
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.780]   or an eight hour feeding window or a 10 hour feeding window.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.540]   And then to place that feeding window in a social
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.440]   and life context that you can manage on a regular basis.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.040]   Now, there are two key points that have been gleaned
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.900]   from the scientific data about this feeding window
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.320]   and when to place it.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.140]   And this is based on a really important experiment
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.080]   that Sachin and his colleagues have been doing.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.660]   There's a website that they have,
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.300]   a zero cost website called My Circadian Clock.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.820]   You can go to this website free of cost.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.660]   There are a number of important resources there,
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:55.280]   but what they've done is they've examined
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.780]   the feeding behavior of thousands of people.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.160]   People will take a picture of the food they're about to eat
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.040]   and it enters into their account,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.920]   maybe your account if you create one on My Circadian Clock.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.700]   And they do this over many days or weeks.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.800]   What's great about this is it establishes
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.080]   what's essentially called a phytogram,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.500]   a time in which people ate.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.400]   And a number of important findings have emerged
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.540]   from these phytograms across large populations
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.060]   of people in different time zones
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:25.460]   with different schedules, et cetera.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.900]   First of all, almost everybody underestimates
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.600]   their feeding window, meaning people who think
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.660]   that they are on an eight hour feeding window
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:40.660]   or six hour feeding window, when their data are analyzed,
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.020]   it almost is always the case that they're actually
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.940]   on a feeding window that's one or even two hours longer
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:46.860]   than they think.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.180]   You think, well, how could that possibly be?
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.380]   If people are taking their first bite at noon
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.380]   and they're taking their last bite at 8 p.m.,
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:57.020]   well, that must mean that they are on that feeding window
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.360]   of eight hours.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.620]   And it turns out that people cheat,
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:03.460]   but they don't cheat in any kind of obvious way.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.420]   They might have, you know, a glass of wine after dinner,
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.660]   or they'll have a cup of tea and a little bite of a cookie.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.780]   And so when people are honest, and they are honest,
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.280]   in most cases, for this experiment,
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.020]   what you find is that most people's eating window
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.160]   is actually quite a bit longer.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.660]   So in discussing this with Satchin
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.940]   and reviewing the literature, it's clear that if you'd like
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.980]   to be on a 10 hour feeding window,
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:29.540]   that you should probably select an eight hour feeding window
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:32.420]   because there's always a little bit of a taper
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.180]   on either side of that eating window.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.640]   Very few people are extremely strict
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.560]   about these eating windows.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.800]   It's just hard to do in the context of life events
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.300]   and social gatherings and family and so forth.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:48.180]   Okay, so as we build forward your ideal fasting/
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.820]   time restricted feeding schedule,
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.980]   we now have several different rules that we can list out.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:57.060]   First, at least no food for the first hour after waking up,
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:59.260]   at least one hour.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:03.300]   Two, no food intake for two,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.200]   and ideally three hours prior to your bedtime.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:12.340]   Three, if you want to select an eight hour feeding window,
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:15.100]   then you should probably focus on a six
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.540]   or seven hour feeding window because in reality,
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.980]   your feeding window is going to be longer.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.060]   Reality meaning real life constraints.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.740]   And if you'd like to be on a 10 hour feeding window,
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.180]   you should probably select an eight
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.740]   or a nine hour feeding window
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.420]   because the way it plays out is that people
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:34.620]   almost always eat outside of their eating window somewhat.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.380]   The other nice thing about selecting
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:40.420]   a slightly shorter eating window than is comfortable for you
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.300]   is that it takes into account that as you take
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.520]   your last bite or your last sip of calories,
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.460]   there's this time or taper before which you are actually
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.120]   in a fasted state.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.780]   And because you're eating different things
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.500]   on different days, presumably,
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.560]   some foods leave your gut more quickly,
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.900]   some things spike your insulin
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.180]   and your glucose more than others.
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.540]   Sometimes you eat more fat, sometimes less fat.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.980]   This allows you to fall well within the margins
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.220]   of the benefits of time restricted feeding
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.900]   that have been demonstrated in humans,
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:16.660]   which generally involve an eight hour window or so.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.840]   So I think this eight hour window or six hour window
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.720]   is a good thing to shoot for, for most people.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.500]   Some people, and we will discuss the exceptions,
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.980]   but some people truly are exceptions to this.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.400]   They just require more food.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.680]   And along those lines,
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.760]   I just now briefly want to touch on some of the studies
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.100]   that have looked at using a very short feeding window
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.780]   of about four hours.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.400]   Nowadays, a number of people are doing
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.340]   the so-called one meal per day or are restricting
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:45.020]   their feeding window to just four hours or six hours.
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.320]   And that turns out to be an interesting strategy.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.320]   And the data around it actually are a little bit surprising.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.720]   One surprising thing to leap out of this massive literature
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.660]   review on time restricted feeding in humans is that
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.140]   relatively short feeding windows of say four to six hours
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.100]   do produce a number of positive health effects,
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.300]   things like increased insulin sensitivity,
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.540]   which we know is good.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.660]   Remember type two diabetes is a reduction
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   in insulin sensitivity,
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.700]   improvements in beta cell function and the pancreas,
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.780]   decreased blood pressure, decreased oxidative stress,
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:24.100]   decreases in things like evening appetite.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.260]   So positive health effects and psychological effects
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.540]   in general.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:33.420]   However, they either produce no change in body weight,
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.680]   or they tend to produce even increases in body weight.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.240]   Now, of course, there's variation between individuals
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.680]   and between studies, but this is somewhat surprising.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.800]   So the eight hour feeding window seems to be very beneficial
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.940]   across almost all the parameters that we've discussed,
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.300]   inflammation, weight loss, fat loss, et cetera,
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.540]   and adherence, I should mention people's ability
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.060]   to stick to the diet seems quite good
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.000]   on this eight hour feeding windows.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.140]   But when people try and undergo very short feeding windows
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.860]   of four to six hours,
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.680]   it seems that they are overeating in that four to six hours,
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.860]   at least overeating with respect to their metabolic needs.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.400]   Now, the contrast to this is the so-called
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.360]   one meal per day schedule.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.820]   Very few studies on one meal per day.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.120]   One meal per day, unless it's a very, very long meal
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.720]   sort of feast, typically would not last four to six hours,
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.820]   because it sort of depends on how you define a meal.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.280]   But when you look at the very few,
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.120]   I should emphasize again,
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.220]   very few studies on one meal per day,
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.740]   people typically maintain or lose weight
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.560]   on the one meal per day schedule.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.400]   So what we can say is that the seven to nine hour
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.740]   feeding window produces all of the major health benefits
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.880]   of time restricted feeding,
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.780]   as well as being pretty straightforward
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.960]   for most people to adhere to on a regular basis
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.120]   and on a regular basis turns out to be very important.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.600]   I'll get back to that point in a moment.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.900]   Whereas the four to six hour eating window
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.280]   doesn't seem to serve people as well as say
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.020]   a seven or eight hour eating window,
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.720]   simply because people are overeating
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.640]   during that eating window and the one meal per day,
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.600]   while perhaps ideal for certain people's schedules
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.360]   may actually cause people to under eat.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360]   And in some cases that might be what people want.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.000]   They actually want to under eat.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.800]   But when we start thinking about performance
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.400]   in work and in sport, and when we start considering
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.840]   hormone health and hormone production, fertility,
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.480]   that's when we can really start to look at the
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.400]   seven to nine hour feeding window
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.260]   versus the four to six hour feeding window
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.400]   versus the one meal per day type feeding window
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.600]   with some different objectivity,
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.400]   we can start to look at it through a different lens
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.540]   because it turns out that when you place the feeding window
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.600]   and how long that feeding window is actually will impact
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.160]   a number of other things in particular hormones
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.680]   that can be very important for a number of things
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.040]   related to sex and reproduction,
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.360]   can be related to performance at work,
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.720]   performance in athleticism.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.660]   And there are excellent studies on this.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.920]   So let's explore those now.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.980]   So let's talk about some conditions where
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.160]   having the feeding window early in the day
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.420]   would actually be very beneficial.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.880]   There was a study that was published recently in cell
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.480]   reports, again, cell press journal, excellent journal,
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.400]   peer reviewed, very stringent from IOMA at all.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.040]   So this is A-O-Y-A-M-A at all.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.740]   This was published just recently in July, 2021
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:36.740]   that looked at the distribution of protein intake
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.860]   in different meals delivered either early in the day
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.080]   or later in the day.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.620]   And I'm summarizing here quite a lot,
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.420]   but I should mention that this study was performed
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.200]   in both mice and humans, same paper, mice and humans,
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.040]   and involved hypertrophy training,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.920]   essentially increasing the weight bearing of given limbs
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.840]   to try and induce hypertrophy,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.240]   which is the growth of muscle tissue.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:08.200]   It does appear that muscle tissue is better able
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.840]   to undergo hypertrophy by virtue of the fact that
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.760]   there's better or enhanced protein synthesis
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.000]   early in the day, because of the expression
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.900]   of one of these particular clock genes called BMAL, B-M-A-L.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:26.400]   BMAL regulates a number of different protein synthesis
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.840]   pathways within muscle cells,
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.280]   such that eating protein early in the day
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.200]   supports muscle tissue maintenance and or growth.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.480]   And in the study, they also looked at the effects
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.860]   of supplementing so-called BCAAs, branch chain amino acids,
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.860]   which is popular in bodybuilding circles
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.380]   and in strength training circles.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.900]   And BCAAs are essential components
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.740]   of a number of different foods,
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.800]   but can also be supplemented.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.100]   The takeaway of the study is pretty straightforward.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.960]   However, the takeaway is if your main interest
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.120]   is maintaining and or building muscle,
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.620]   then it can be beneficial to ingest protein early in the day.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.680]   You would still want to obey this,
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.540]   what we're calling a kind of foundational rule
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:15.680]   of not eating any food for the first hour post waking,
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.560]   or at least the first hour post waking.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.480]   And the cutoff for when you would want to eat protein
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.080]   would be sometime before 10 AM.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.880]   And there I'm averaging across a number
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.280]   of different situations.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.800]   But in general, this BMAL expression is such that,
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.460]   let's say you wake up at 7 AM,
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.500]   your main interest is in hypertrophy
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.760]   or maintenance of muscle.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.600]   Then you would want to ingest some protein
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.960]   sometime before 10 AM.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.420]   But obviously if you're interested in getting
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.400]   the health effects of intermittent fasting,
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.960]   that you wouldn't ingest any food
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.320]   for at least the first 60 minutes upon waking.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.880]   Now it's not as if at 1001 AM,
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.600]   a gate slammed shut and you can't generate hypertrophy.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.760]   Of course, that's not the case.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.120]   However, it's very interesting that it doesn't matter
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.640]   when the resistance training,
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:06.000]   the load bearing exercise occurs in the 24 hour cycle.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.680]   So whether or not, in other words,
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.260]   people are training early in the day
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.060]   or they're training late in the day,
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.820]   it still appears that ingesting protein early in the day
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.500]   favors hypertrophy or that one is better,
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.980]   or I should say more easily able to access hypertrophy
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:26.220]   by way of these clock regulated protein synthesis mechanisms
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.980]   by ingesting protein early in the day.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.420]   In no way, shape or form does this study say
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.200]   that ingesting protein later in the day
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.360]   is somehow bad for you.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.820]   It just emphasizes the positive effects
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.060]   of ingesting protein early in the day
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:42.920]   for sake of muscle maintenance and or hypertrophy.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.680]   So if you're somebody who's mainly concerned
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.780]   with muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.520]   then it may make sense to move that feeding window
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.840]   earlier in the day.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.520]   And certainly there are people out there
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.280]   who are interested in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.020]   who aren't doing intermittent fasting at all.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.240]   And that's also perfectly fine,
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.020]   but this just so happens to be an episode
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.540]   about intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.320]   There are of course modes of eating
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.080]   where one eats small meals spread throughout the day
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.520]   or weights meals differently such that meals early in the day
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.920]   are larger than later in the day or vice versa.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.140]   There are in a near infinite number of ways to organize this.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.100]   But if you are somebody who's interested in deriving
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.960]   the many clearly established health effects
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.160]   of time restricted feeding,
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.020]   and you are somebody who would like to maintain
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.920]   or build muscle,
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:35.040]   then ingesting proteins in the early part of the day
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.580]   would be important to you,
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.840]   at least on the basis of these results.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.400]   And therefore that eight hour window
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.240]   that we've established as more or less ideal
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.360]   shifted to the later part of the day
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.660]   might not be as beneficial for you.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.720]   Now, I can just personally say that for me,
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.760]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.800]   it's very easy for me to not eat
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.560]   until noon or one or 2 p.m.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.920]   Eating early in the day is actually somewhat of a challenge.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.720]   I discussed this point with Sachin
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.200]   because we were talking about
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.220]   how is it that one can move their feeding window
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.920]   or place themselves onto a different schedule
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.480]   of intermittent fasting.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.000]   And it's very clear that one needs to provide
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.700]   a transition period in order for that to happen.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.720]   You should allow yourself a transition period
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.820]   of anywhere from one week to 10 days
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:23.720]   in which you shift your feeding window
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.800]   by about an hour each day or so.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.340]   And then once you establish a feeding window
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.880]   that feels comfortable for you
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.180]   and that you think you can maintain over time,
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.680]   that you simply maintain that feeding schedule
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.920]   for at least 30 days,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.280]   but ideally you would do that indefinitely.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.840]   Now, this turns out to be important
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.600]   based on data that they've gleaned
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.280]   from this my circadian clock,
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.760]   massive experiment that they've been doing
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.920]   where people are entering the times
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.820]   that they're feeding and eating.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.040]   Excuse me, anytime we talk about mice,
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.100]   I always think about feeding
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.780]   because I come from a background
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.420]   and my lab works on both laboratory mice and on humans.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.240]   Anytime I think about humans, I think about eating,
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.140]   but of course they are the same thing.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.000]   The interesting thing to emerge
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.720]   from that very large data set in humans
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.780]   is that when people log their feeding times,
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.700]   as I mentioned before,
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.000]   oftentimes they think they're eating in an eight hour window,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.280]   but they are actually eating in a much broader window.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.080]   However, even for people that are very good
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.940]   about restricting their feeding
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.120]   to a four or six or eight hour window,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.340]   if they're very strict about the start and stop times
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.760]   when they ingest calories,
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.580]   one of the findings that's really been important to note
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.980]   is that almost every individual has a lot of drift
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.180]   in when that eating window resides in their 24 hour period.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.260]   In particular on the weekends,
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:48.140]   people are either extending or shifting their feeding window
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.580]   in a way that makes it seem that they've traveled
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:51.740]   to another time zone
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.940]   and are eating according to another time zone.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.360]   And this is extremely important.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.540]   As I mentioned earlier, based on the 2012 study
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.900]   from Sachin's lab,
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:07.500]   we're eating at a particular phase of each 24 hour cycle
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.360]   can help enhance the expression of these clock genes.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:15.540]   If you are eating within a very strict
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.180]   or semi-strict feeding window,
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.220]   but that feeding window is migrating around from day to day
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.260]   or five days a week,
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.940]   you're really organized about when that falls,
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:27.140]   let's say for sake of example, from noon to 8 PM,
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.680]   noon to 8 PM, Monday, noon to 8 PM, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.480]   noon to 8 PM, Thursday, and so forth.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.360]   But then on a Saturday, it's becoming 11 AM
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.900]   and you're ending it early,
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:43.320]   or perhaps you're starting early in the day on Sunday,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.680]   you're having brunch that starts at 930 or 10,
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.240]   and then it's extending out still just eight hours,
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.840]   but it's shifting around.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.820]   That can cause disruptions
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.880]   in these circadian clock mechanisms
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.680]   that cause disruptions in the downstream effects of eating
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.320]   that are taking at least two to three days to recover from.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.160]   So obviously we don't want to be overly neurotic
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.000]   about this stuff,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.600]   but because this is an episode about the science
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.760]   of intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding,
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.520]   as important as how long your feeding window is,
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.020]   is where that feeding window resides in each 24 hour cycle.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.220]   And perhaps even more important than that
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.180]   is that it be fairly regular
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.060]   where that feeding window resides,
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.060]   because even if you have a very short feeding window,
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.940]   if it's drifting around from day to day,
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.760]   that actually offsets a number
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.880]   of the positive health effects of intermittent fasting.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.360]   So to really just underscore the way
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.920]   that these different pieces
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.980]   of the biological puzzle fit together,
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.280]   if you are very strict or semi-strict
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.660]   about your eight hour feeding window,
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.500]   but on the weekends,
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.580]   that eight hour feeding window is falling later
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.120]   than it normally would during the middle of the week,
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.800]   it is as if you are going to bed later,
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.040]   even if you're going to bed at the same time,
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.080]   at least from the perspective of metabolic health,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.900]   because of the way that eating impacts these clock genes
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.520]   and impacts, or I should say,
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.820]   subtracts the sleep-related fasting
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.400]   that you would normally experience
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.720]   if you were to finish eating
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.460]   a couple hours before bedtime.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.620]   So again, we don't want to create any overly obsessive
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.560]   or neurotic focus on this.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.840]   I think that most all people could benefit
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.260]   from a time-restricted feeding schedule,
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.360]   but they should really think hard
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.040]   about what they can stick to on a regular basis
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.960]   and understand that they tend to underestimate
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.240]   the feeding window that they actually are partaking in,
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.840]   and that they should place that feeding window
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.600]   in a portion of the 24 hour cycle
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.920]   that they can be consistent on most days.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.280]   And I want to emphasize most,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.580]   again, because we are not laboratory mice.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.720]   We don't have a graduate student
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.960]   coming in for eight hours a day
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.320]   because that's what their significant other
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.160]   will allow them to do.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.900]   And then removing the food from our jowls
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.160]   and from our cages.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.860]   We have access to food pretty much 24 hours a day.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:59.860]   Along those lines, however,
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.660]   there are things that we can all do
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:07.320]   that will allow us to offset some of the drift,
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.200]   if you will, that we experience
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.080]   or that we induce in terms of
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.560]   when our feeding window occurs
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.780]   or that the feeding window might push out a little later
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.500]   and then therefore start a little later the next day.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.340]   There are things that we can do
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.560]   and there are things that we can take.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.600]   And so I'd like to discuss those briefly.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.340]   So throughout this episode,
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.360]   I've more or less been alluding to the fact
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.240]   that when you eat,
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.760]   there's some period of time afterwards
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   in which you're actually still eating,
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.740]   at least from the perspective of metabolism,
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.520]   because glucose is up, insulin is up,
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.040]   and you're undergoing different metabolic
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.880]   and digestive processes that don't really speak to you
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.120]   being in a fasted state, right?
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.460]   It's not just about when you take your last bite
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:49.560]   or your last sip.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.960]   However, there are things that we can do
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.800]   to accelerate the transition from a fed state
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.360]   to a fasted state.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.160]   And so I'd like to discuss what those are.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.560]   And I want to emphasize that the term fed state
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.080]   is probably a better way to think about it
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.920]   than eating or not eating,
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.700]   because we think of eating as the verb.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.560]   We're eating, we're eating.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.440]   Okay, we're done eating, I'm fasting now,
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.120]   but you're not actually fasting because you are fed.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.160]   So we should really think about fed and unfed states
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.440]   because from a cellular processes perspective
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.920]   and from a health perspective,
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.400]   that's actually what your body and your system
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.760]   are paying attention to.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.320]   And by now with everything that we've laid out,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.440]   I think that should be intuitive to understand.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.880]   So there's a fun and exciting concept related to this,
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.460]   which is glucose clearing.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.800]   You may have heard the old adage
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.760]   that if you take a 20 or 30 minute walk after dinner,
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.780]   that it accelerates the rate at which you digest that food.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.660]   And indeed it does.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.560]   Clearing out of glucose from your system
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.820]   can be accomplished through a number of different means,
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.220]   but light movement or exercise
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.880]   does increase gastric emptying time.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.400]   So for instance,
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.720]   if you were to eat a meal that ended at 8 PM
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.020]   and then plop to the couch, watch TV,
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.680]   or get on your computer or go to sleep,
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.520]   it would be five or six hours until you have transitioned
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.360]   from a fed state to a fasted state.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.400]   However, you can accelerate that considerably
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.860]   by taking a 20 or 30 minute, just light walk.
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:27.260]   It doesn't have to be speed walking.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.460]   It certainly doesn't have to be jogging,
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.880]   but just walking outside or moving around.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.520]   So glucose clearing is an important aspect of the transition
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.860]   from the fed state to the fasted state.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.300]   And just a light walk can allow you to do that.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.640]   Now, if you can't get outside,
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.600]   some people will go through the gymnastics literally
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.800]   of doing things like air squats and pushups
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.640]   and things like that.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.200]   And indeed those will increase the expression of things
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.480]   like Glut4 and things that mobilize glucose into muscles
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.320]   and things of that sort.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.400]   But, you know, under most conditions,
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.240]   most people aren't doing pushups after dinner,
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.120]   or certainly if you've had a big meal,
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   just taking a light walk can be beneficial.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   In addition, you could consider doing intense exercise.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.980]   Now you wouldn't necessarily want to do that
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.160]   immediately after eating.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.360]   So let's take a look at what high intensity training
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.800]   of any kind does to blood glucose.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.640]   Because in this case,
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.360]   it turns out that when you do high intensity training
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.560]   actually has opposite effects on blood glucose,
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.260]   depending on whether or not you do it early
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:29.840]   or later in the day.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.040]   So a fairly recent study looked at so-called HIIT training,
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.880]   high intensity interval training,
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.000]   which of course can take many different forms.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.580]   It can take the form of circuit training with weights.
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.060]   It can take the form of, you know, burpees and pushups
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.100]   and sprints and all sorts of different things.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.000]   But high intensity interval training is typically training
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.480]   that gets people's heart rates up, you know,
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.820]   well above 70% of maximum,
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.900]   and then brief periods of rest and then repeating.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.700]   And how long the high intensity interval training,
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.420]   of course, will also vary.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.640]   There are very brief, you know,
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.960]   six or 12 or 15 minute workouts.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.540]   Some people can carry on with high intensity interval
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:08.420]   training for up to 45 or maybe even 60 minutes
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.360]   in extreme cases.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.420]   But when you look at the studies that have explored high
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.720]   intensity interval training and its effect on blood glucose,
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.520]   there are a couple of studies that leap out.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.360]   For instance,
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.120]   one that emphasized that blood glucose levels will actually
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.740]   increase if high intensity interval training is performed
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.780]   early in the day and will decrease if high intensity
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.000]   interval training is performed later in the day.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   Now, the purpose for this exploration was not to explore
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.080]   clearance of blood glucose for sake of intermittent
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:39.920]   fasting.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.360]   It was mainly focused on athletic performance and whether
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   or not that was better early in the day or later in the day,
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.560]   et cetera.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.020]   But we can extract some information from these studies that
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.920]   are beneficial for sake of understanding glucose clearing.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.100]   If you have ingested food throughout the afternoon and
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.100]   evening and late in the day,
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.800]   and you're thinking about going to sleep and you'd like to
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.840]   enter sleep in a way that is less fed and more fasted,
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.700]   then engaging in high intensity interval training in the
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.240]   afternoon will lower or evening,
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.040]   I should say will lower blood glucose.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.640]   And in that way will help you accelerate your transition
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.260]   into the fastest state provided you don't ingest something
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.540]   after the high intensity interval training.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:25.300]   Now is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from high
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.560]   intensity interval training early in the day,
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.660]   is that detrimental?
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:32.560]   Not necessarily so that oftentimes is associated with the
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.840]   shuttling of nutrients to the muscles that have just done a
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.940]   lot of hard work.
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.240]   So it's not that high intensity interval training should not
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.380]   be done early in the day.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.320]   In fact, for many people,
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.080]   including myself training early in the day,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.520]   just for the way that my psychology and biology works is
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.040]   always better for me than training later in the day.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.700]   And the other important thing to mention is that high
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.060]   intensity interval training done late in the day can be
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.520]   beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing,
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.920]   lowering blood glucose and helping transition from the fed
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.920]   to the fasted state in preparation for sleep.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.840]   However, if you're ingesting caffeine or anything to engage
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.920]   in that high intensity interval training in a way that
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.800]   prevents you from getting to sleep, well,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.960]   then it's going to be detrimental overall.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.000]   So the reason I mentioned this is of course,
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   because it's nice to know that light walks after dinner or
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.640]   any other meal for that matter or high intensity interval
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.800]   training provided it's done in the second half of the day,
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.880]   can lower blood glucose and speed the transition from fed to
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.280]   fasted states.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.900]   But I also mention it because what we are really trying to
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.200]   achieve when we partake in intermittent fasting,
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.900]   so-called time restricted feeding is what we're really
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:45.900]   trying to do is access unfed states or fasted states.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.480]   It's not really about when you eat and what you do.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.080]   It's about extending the duration of the fasting period,
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.760]   as long as you can,
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.880]   in a way that's still compatible with your eating, right?
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.760]   Not the other way around.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.080]   And this gets back to this key feature of our biology,
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.960]   which is that what we eat, when we eat, when we exercise,
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.880]   when we view light,
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.200]   it's about setting a context or a set of conditions in your
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.460]   brain and body.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.220]   So it's not so much about the activities that you undergo.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.600]   It's about the activities you undergo and their relationship
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.500]   to one another over time.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.420]   And so in this way,
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.340]   it really beautifully highlights the way that your biology is
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.560]   interacting all the time.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.340]   Light is setting when you're going to be awake and when
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.620]   you're going to be asleep,
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.500]   when you eat is going to be determining when you're going to
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.300]   be awake and when you're going to be asleep and when you eat
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:37.140]   is also going to be determining when you are able to clear
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:41.040]   out debris from your brain and body and repair the various
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.720]   cells and mechanisms of your body,
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.700]   when you're able to reduce those inflammatory cytokines
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:46.940]   throughout your body.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.680]   And this is really the beauty of time-restricted feeding,
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.560]   which is it's not really about restricting your feeding.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.000]   It's about accessing the beauty of the fasted state.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.980]   Now, there are other ways to clear out blood glucose that
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.740]   involve supplements or prescription drugs.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:06.400]   These are so-called glucose disposal agents,
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.380]   glucose disposal agents, such as metformin,
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.460]   which is a prescription drug or berberine,
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:15.940]   which is an over the counter substance will lead to very
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.580]   dramatic reductions in blood glucose.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.180]   And so they shift you from a fed to a fasted state.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:25.980]   And I know many people who take berberine before eating
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.940]   meals that include a large number of carbohydrates,
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.100]   for instance, as a way to clear out glucose.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.580]   Now I've tried berberine before.
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.540]   And what I can tell you is that if you take berberine,
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.480]   which by the way is very much like metformin,
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.000]   its effects are almost identical to metformin in fact,
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.820]   but it's much less expensive and it's over the counter.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.180]   If you take berberine and you have not ingested
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:49.500]   carbohydrates, many people, including myself,
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.140]   experience a splitting headache.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:55.540]   You become hypoglycemic because it is a glucose clearing
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.380]   agent.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.220]   So if you're going to experiment with things like
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.100]   metformin and or berberine or similar,
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.260]   you want to be very cautious that you're not clearing out
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.580]   blood glucose, that's already low.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:10.280]   And the dose response for this varies tremendously from one
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.600]   individual to the next.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.020]   And there's a strong circadian component.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:17.200]   So some people react very well to berberine early in the
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.060]   day, but find that later in the day,
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.560]   it provides extreme headaches for some people,
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.660]   it's the opposite.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.180]   So I caution you in exploring things like berberine and
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.720]   metformin that you should expect to experience a number of
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.240]   physical and psychological effects that may work for you,
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.160]   might be great for you, but might also not be great for you.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.000]   Nowadays,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.700]   there are a number of commercially available,
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.660]   continuous glucose monitors.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.500]   I've tried one of these.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.060]   It involves putting what's essentially a patch with a little
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.240]   needle that goes into your skin, which is continuing,
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.260]   continually, excuse me,
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.740]   monitoring your blood glucose.
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.620]   And you can look at it at an app on your phone.
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.020]   And you can learn a lot that way about how different foods
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.660]   impact the increases and decrease in blood glucose.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.020]   If you're doing experiments with berberine or metformin,
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.980]   you can see how those impact your blood glucose.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:07.240]   You can see how exercise hit training or otherwise impact
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.860]   impacts blood glucose.
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.700]   Excuse me again.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:14.360]   It's very hard to assess blood glucose without a continuous
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.420]   blood glucose monitor.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.800]   And if you're not using one,
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.560]   you're mainly going to be relying on subjective things like,
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.780]   oh, I feel like I have low blood sugar.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:23.180]   I feel shaky.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.580]   Like I have high blood sugar or shaky.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.580]   Cause you have low blood sugar.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:30.580]   So I have to say that glucose clearing agents that involve a
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:35.500]   walk or exercise moderate or intense are going to be a lot
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.780]   easier to titrate and adjust the levels of,
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.140]   then things that you're going to take,
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.520]   where you have to ingest the dosage.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.740]   And then once you ingest a certain dosage,
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.820]   you're along for the ride,
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:47.260]   at least until the effects of that particular compound wear
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.460]   off, it doesn't mean those things don't have utility.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.420]   It doesn't mean people aren't using them because many
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:56.420]   people are, but they are potentially a very sharp blade.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:58.900]   That is a double sided blade.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.020]   So I encourage you to approach those with caution.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:03.060]   If you decide to at all,
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.540]   it's worth thinking about what the low blood glucose state
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.820]   is and why it's beneficial,
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.100]   as well as why it might produce headaches.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.700]   And in some cases can also adjust the effects of other
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.020]   hormones in the fasted state.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:20.180]   A number of different proteins that are expressed in cells
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.820]   undergo changes in their expression.
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.380]   We talked about this earlier.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.980]   When we are fasted,
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.540]   we tend to reduce the activity of a particular protein
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.220]   called mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR is very
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.420]   active in cells while they are growing.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:37.100]   So throughout development,
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.320]   it's also very active in cancers of various kinds.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.340]   mTOR needs to be what's called phosphorylated.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.900]   If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:49.620]   But phosphorylation is a manner in which certain proteins
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.300]   are altered so that they can actually be functional within
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.460]   cells. mTOR is associated with cell growth of all kinds,
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.820]   healthy and unhealthy.
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:02.460]   When mTOR is phosphorylated, there's a marker called PS6.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:05.540]   So phospho mTOR expresses PS6.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:08.320]   If this is all escaping you, don't worry about it.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.460]   Phospho mTOR and PS6 are reduced by fasting.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.180]   Now this makes sense if you think about it,
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:17.300]   because eating and growth are associated with each other.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.960]   Fasting is not necessarily anti-growth,
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.500]   but it is not pro-growth.
[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.900]   And when we fast, we see increases in cells of things like
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.160]   AMPK, the sirtuins, things like transcription factors,
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.720]   like FOXO, ATF and ketones or ketone bodies.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.620]   You may have heard of the ketogenic diet.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.160]   What's the point of all this biochemistry.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.440]   It's not to just blitz you with a bunch of cellular biology
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.660]   and biochemistry.
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:45.140]   It's to say that we have cell growth pathways involving
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.580]   mTOR and PS6.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:52.580]   And we have cell repair and cell shrinkage processes
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.060]   that are associated with AMPK, the so-called sirtuins,
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.180]   which Dr. David Sinclair from Harvard and others are famous
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:04.100]   for discovering and understanding things like AMPK.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.060]   These two different divergent pathways of cell growth
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:10.180]   and cell breakdown and repair.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.260]   And by breakdown, I mean actual clearance,
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.980]   autophagy and repair.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.680]   Those can be triggered by being in either the fed
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.980]   or the fasted state.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.680]   So one way I'd like you to think about the fed state,
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.540]   not just eating, but having recently eaten
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:27.940]   or the fasted state, meaning high blood glucose
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:31.980]   and or you've recently eaten or are currently eating
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:34.780]   or drinking calories is that when you eat
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.100]   or when you don't eat, when you're fed, when you're fasted,
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:40.180]   you are either promoting cellular growth of all kinds
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:43.460]   or you're promoting cellular repair and clearance
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.460]   of all kinds.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.860]   And so, again, this is about setting conditions
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.300]   in the brain and body.
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:52.440]   It's not so much about when you eat food A or B,
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.980]   it leads to increases in mTOR.
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.860]   Anytime you eat any food,
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.940]   doesn't matter if it's plant-based, animal-based, fat,
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.840]   protein, carbohydrate, doesn't matter.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.960]   You are biasing your system towards a biochemical state
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.840]   of cell growth.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.300]   And anytime you haven't eaten for a while
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.500]   or blood glucose is low, you're biasing your system
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.900]   toward a state of cellular repair.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.480]   And this is why people who do not suffer
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:20.300]   from any blood glucose regulation issues,
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.080]   take things like berberine as glucose disposal agents
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:23.920]   or take metformin.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.380]   I'm not necessarily suggesting that you do that,
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.180]   but it's because those things mimic fasting.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:32.060]   They create situations in the body that promote things
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.540]   like AMPK and the sirtuins and others to push your body
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.820]   and your system down a route of repair,
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.660]   even though you might've just eaten a meal an hour ago.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:42.540]   Along the lines of the health benefits
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.300]   of intermittent fasting,
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.820]   there are nice data showing improvements
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:51.000]   in the gut microbiome and in particular,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.420]   in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.620]   and other forms of colitis in time-restricted feeding,
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.020]   meaning time-restricted feeding seems to be able
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.980]   to assist people with those conditions,
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:05.420]   following the general parameters that I discussed before,
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.700]   eight hours and so forth.
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.700]   Why and how?
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.700]   Well, by way of intermittent fasting,
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:14.100]   impacting the expression of these various clock genes
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:17.280]   and because the clock genes impact the mucosal lining,
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.540]   the mucus lining of the gut,
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:24.540]   it appears that intermittent fasting can reduce the amount
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:28.000]   of so-called lactobacillus that's present in the gut
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.840]   and lactobacillus is when in high levels is correlated
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.300]   with a number of different metabolic disorders.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.440]   At the same time, time-restricted feeding seems
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:41.060]   to enhance the proliferation of some of the gut microbiota
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:43.900]   like oscillobacter and some of the other ones
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.420]   that promote healthy mucosal lining
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:50.480]   and that promote better overall intestinal function.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.400]   So these are pathways that have now been established
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.060]   and it appears that intermittent fasting
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:57.340]   isn't just modulating these processes,
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:58.940]   but is actually having a direct effect
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.180]   on the mucosal lining in a way
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.740]   that favors a healthier gut microbiome.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.140]   So it should come as no surprise that many people
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.040]   who experience gut issues benefit
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.780]   from restricting their feeding window to eight hours or so
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:11.700]   per every 24 hour period.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.420]   The other very exciting finding about intermittent fasting
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:17.260]   is one of the major health issues these days
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:20.500]   is the proliferation of so-called
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:23.440]   non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.300]   30 years or so non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.260]   was exceedingly rare to see in the clinic
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.580]   except in alcoholics.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.580]   Fatty deposits in the liver are bad.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.900]   It is essentially liver disease.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.140]   Nowadays, children and adults are showing up
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:40.180]   with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:42.940]   Some of these people are obese, others are not,
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.700]   but it's a serious health concern
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.040]   and it's growing in numbers all the time.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:51.700]   A recent study that was published in Cell Reports Medicine
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:54.860]   just a couple of weeks ago tested the hypothesis
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.340]   whether or not the gut microbiome
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:01.780]   or so-called brown fat tissue is impacting the liver health
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:06.020]   and in particular non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.340]   The short takeaway from the study
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.260]   is that contrary to what was previously thought,
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.660]   the gut microbiome, while very important
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:15.420]   for a number of other processes in the body,
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.920]   doesn't seem to be related
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.900]   to this non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:20.960]   This is surprising to people or should be
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.360]   to those of you that have been following
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.660]   the gut microbiome literature.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.860]   However, brown fat, which is a healthy fat
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:30.740]   that we have between our two scapulae and in our upper neck,
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.860]   it doesn't tend to be blubbery type fat pads,
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.560]   but it sits deep to the skin,
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.660]   but creates a thermogenic effect in the body that is helpful
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.480]   for reducing the amount of other fat,
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.520]   the type of fat that we're more typically used
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.680]   to thinking about and talking about,
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.040]   white fat and pink fat that's subcutaneous fat
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.640]   around the abdomen and so forth.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.980]   Brown fat seems to have a direct correlation
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:55.580]   with the lack of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:58.280]   What this study showed was that in people
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:02.060]   that have diminished concentrations of brown fat,
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.780]   there is a higher probability
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.820]   of having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:10.680]   Now, the good news is brown fat stores can be increased.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.260]   And again, this isn't going to create blubber of brown fat.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.060]   This is going to create increased thermogenesis
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.220]   and actually make people leaner.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.200]   And brown fat has a number
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.500]   of other important positive effects.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.420]   Now, this is interesting because cold exposure
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:25.660]   of anywhere from one to three minutes,
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.660]   two or four times per week, or maybe even 10 minutes,
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:31.140]   two to four times per week can increase brown fat stores.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:34.540]   Also, time restricted feeding has now been tied
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:37.620]   to the density of brown fat stores.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.480]   So time restricted feeding also seems
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.100]   to positively increase brown fat stores,
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.300]   probably because of the way that brown fat stores relate
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.820]   to epinephrine and adrenaline,
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:48.220]   which tend to go up when we're fasted.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.140]   What does this all mean?
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.640]   This means for sake of liver health
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.500]   and for sake of reducing or maybe preventing,
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.320]   or even potentially, I want to underline potentially,
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.940]   reversing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:03.380]   time restricted feeding also appears to be beneficial.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.060]   Many people out there are interested
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:07.540]   in optimizing their hormones.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.820]   And as we mentioned earlier, insulin is a hormone
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.620]   and time restricted feeding seems
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:12.920]   to have very positive effects
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.980]   on overall insulin profiles and so forth.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:18.620]   But anytime you mention hormones,
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.980]   people immediately seem to leap
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:23.220]   to the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:24.900]   because indeed they have powerful effects,
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.540]   both in the short term and the long term,
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.700]   in terms of our mental and physical health
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.120]   and performance.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.660]   There's at least one study that's explored the effects
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:36.780]   of time restricted eating on performance,
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:40.620]   athletic performance, immune function and body composition.
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.060]   This was a study by Morrow et al
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.060]   that was performed on elite cyclists.
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.660]   So I want to point that out.
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:49.420]   It was a randomized control trial,
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.740]   but what's really nice about this study is
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:56.340]   that it explored a number of different hormonal parameters
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.640]   in people that were using time restricted eating
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.160]   or that had a more extended eating window.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.560]   And they tracked everything very carefully.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.980]   And the amount of food they were eating
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:10.260]   was actually pretty considerable, 4,800 calories.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:11.820]   So that's a lot of calories,
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.960]   but then again, they were very active.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.900]   And they've measured a number
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.940]   of different things related to VO2 max, et cetera.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:23.580]   Performance and overall performance at what they did,
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:26.860]   cycling, is not the point that I want to emphasize here.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.900]   Although there were some positive effects
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:32.040]   on their performance related to time restricted eating.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.280]   The point I want to talk about relates
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.320]   to things that presumably relate to most everybody,
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.960]   which are the effects on things like glucose,
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.880]   thyroid hormone, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:48.200]   which can bind up testosterone
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.960]   and prevent the so-called free form of testosterone,
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.340]   which is the one that has most of the actions
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:55.120]   in the brain and body.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.680]   And the major takeaway from this study was
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.260]   that time restricted feeding of the same amount of calories
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.720]   as the so-called control condition, okay?
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.740]   Same calories, but either compact
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:10.020]   throughout the 24 hour cycle to an eight hour feeding window
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:13.760]   or allowing them to eat over a larger feeding window
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:18.060]   did lead to significant decreases in free testosterone.
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.160]   And I think a number of people
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.240]   will raise their eyebrows to that and think,
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.080]   oh, well then maybe time restricted feeding is not for me.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.680]   There are a number of important considerations.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.080]   Of course, one is while the decrease
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.680]   in free testosterone was significant,
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.960]   it's also going to depend on where people start out.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.000]   So if somebody has already low or modest levels
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.880]   of testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.840]   that could lead them into a state
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.720]   of poor performance and wellbeing.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.000]   Whereas if somebody has higher testosterone,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.880]   a decrease won't necessarily do that.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.080]   So it's important to take that into consideration.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.280]   This is why I'm always such a fan
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.480]   of people doing their blood work
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.520]   and knowing what's going on under the hood for them.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.520]   A very interesting change in hormonal profile
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.240]   was cortisol, so-called stress hormone.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.560]   Cortisol of course is also naturally released
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.880]   early in the day in a healthy way
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.280]   to wake you up and promote alertness,
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.820]   but you don't want its levels to be too high
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:13.600]   or to have peaks in cortisol late in the day.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.040]   It's actually correlated with depression
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.780]   and a number of other untoward things.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:22.120]   I would have thought that by restricting a feeding window
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.400]   to a particular time each day,
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.160]   that these hard training cyclists
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:29.360]   would have undergone increases in serum cortisol.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.000]   And in fact, the opposite was true.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.680]   They had significant reductions in serum cortisol
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.680]   as a consequence of time restricted feeding.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.600]   I should mention there were significant reductions
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.680]   in serum cortisol also in the control group,
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.640]   but not to the same extent.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.640]   And the two groups did differ significantly
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.040]   from one another.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.680]   Now, this is important because if you just look
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.800]   at one hormone, testosterone, you'd say,
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.880]   okay, based on these data, time restricted feeding
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.520]   is reducing testosterone levels significantly,
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.540]   even though the number of calories is quite high
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.520]   and is held constant across the study.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.680]   But in fact, because cortisol is lower,
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.120]   it may mean that the effects of testosterone
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.260]   or the reduction in testosterone is offset.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.500]   And that's because cortisol and testosterone
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.920]   are always in this somewhat of a dance
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.460]   in terms of cortisol,
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.920]   inhibiting the effects of testosterone largely
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.160]   and vice versa.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.380]   So it is interesting and important to look
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:24.400]   at the total gallery of hormones.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.700]   And they did look at a number of hormones.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.480]   They looked at other inflammatory markers.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.720]   Those were not increased.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.740]   That's not surprising.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.740]   If you remember back to the 2012 Sachin Panda study,
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:36.980]   this early pioneering study on time restricted feeding,
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.600]   they saw reductions in stress hormones
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.400]   and in inflammatory markers in time restricted feeding mice.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.200]   And here, this also seems to be the case in humans.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.440]   So the takeaway is for sake of hormone health,
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:53.900]   time restricted feeding is compatible
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.520]   with quality hormone health,
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.920]   even in high-performing athletes.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.900]   Based on everything we know and that we've discussed,
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.200]   I would not suggest that people restrict their feeding
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.720]   window to less than eight hours,
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.500]   especially if they're training hard on a regular basis.
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:10.820]   And it's not just athletes that should pay attention to this
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:12.240]   when we are working very hard,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.280]   when we are psychologically stressed,
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.960]   when we are studying for exams,
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.980]   or we are in conflict with somebody on a regular basis,
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.880]   that creates a stress in the body
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.420]   that's very similar to that of physical training.
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:26.840]   The body and brain don't distinguish
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.580]   between physical stress and mental stress.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.720]   It's all nervous system.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.020]   Remember that it's just cortisol and adrenaline.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:35.400]   There's no special hormone just for physical stress
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.220]   versus psychological stress.
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:39.960]   So again, in thinking about what sort of feeding window
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.780]   will be right for you,
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:43.960]   we arrive back at this eight hour time bin
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.680]   that seems more or less flexible for most conditions,
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.680]   even high-performing elite athletes.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.720]   And I would say just by logical extension,
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.080]   even for people that have a lot of stress in their life.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.080]   And I personally wouldn't suggest that people
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.320]   who have a lot of stress in their life
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.240]   or the potential for stress in their life
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.540]   shorten their feeding window much shorter than eight hours,
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.080]   because then you would expect that you would start
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.400]   to increase some of the inflammatory markers.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.200]   You would increase the stress hormones
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.800]   and you would be decreasing things like testosterone
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.720]   and estrogen and some of the sex steroid hormones.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.500]   So again, it's all about context and the eight hour window.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:23.200]   It isn't holy, but seems to be a really useful guide
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.800]   to extract the great health benefits of which,
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.680]   there are many in of which we've discussed
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.760]   from intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.900]   and yet that it could still be compatible
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:37.620]   with decent social schedules
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:40.080]   and for maintaining hormone health.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.420]   In keeping with this, for women that are trying
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.080]   to maintain ovulatory cycles,
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.760]   or for couples that are trying to get pregnant,
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.260]   I think it's also important to not create a feeding window
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:52.520]   that's too short.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:56.760]   The relationship between feeding and body fat stores
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.600]   and glucose and leptin and hormones
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.680]   is a well-established one.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.280]   And we can summarize it very easily here,
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.200]   although I've done several episodes related to this
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.560]   previously on optimizing hormone health.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.560]   But basically we undergo puberty when there's enough food
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.560]   and there's enough body fat,
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.320]   that the body fat sends a signal to the brain called leptin.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.840]   That's a hormone that comes from body fat,
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.960]   signals to the brain to turn on puberty.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:23.520]   That's puberty, but even as adults,
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.140]   for women that are menstruating,
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.940]   there needs to be sufficient leptin signaling to the brain
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:29.340]   in order to maintain ovulation
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.000]   because of the way that the brain communicates
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.800]   with the pituitary and the ovaries.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   Similarly for men, fasting or extreme exercise plus fasting,
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.260]   we now know reduces testosterone.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:45.700]   Its impacts are not exactly clear.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:48.480]   However, if you reduce food intake,
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.080]   either in total calories or in duration too much,
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.720]   you will suffer a drop in sperm counts, fertility will drop.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.560]   And this makes sense.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.140]   The body is communicating to the brain
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:01.360]   whether or not conditions are sufficient in the body
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.360]   to reproduce and to presumably and hopefully
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.040]   support the health and wellbeing of those offspring.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.960]   So there's a logical link between body fat and eating
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.400]   and how much food is available to you
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.200]   and how long it's available to you
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   and the signals in the brain
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.440]   that allow for reproductive success.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.960]   There are some data that pointed differences
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:22.840]   in the effects of intermittent fasting
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:25.480]   for males versus females.
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:28.020]   Those data right now only come from mice.
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.440]   That study was published by Sachin Panda recently.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.560]   We still await the studies in humans.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.360]   Some people do not do well on intermittent fasting,
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.840]   either in terms of mood or hormone health.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.720]   And so everyone needs to determine for themselves
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.560]   whether or not having a time restricted feeding window
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.640]   is good for them,
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.080]   how long that time restricted feeding window should be.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.280]   I think eight hours is kind of a nice minimum to adhere to
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.220]   based on everything that we've covered today.
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.800]   And for some people,
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.020]   time restricted feeding is not going to be compatible
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:58.140]   with hormone health for them.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:01.720]   For them eating more meals spread throughout the day,
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.560]   presumably smaller meals, same caloric intake
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.740]   is going to be more beneficial for their hormones.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.600]   This is something that is going to be individual
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.760]   and is going to have to be determined
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.940]   on an individual basis.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.220]   However, if you're going to try time restricted feeding,
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.980]   I do want to remind you that taking a period of three to seven
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:20.060]   or ideally 10 days to transition into it,
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:23.300]   not just going flipping from eating to three meals a day
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.160]   that span from 6 AM to 10 PM
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.140]   and suddenly going to an eight hour feeding window,
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:30.440]   but rather winnowing down that feeding window
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.360]   about an hour or so per day
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.640]   is going to allow the hormone systems of your body,
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.400]   including leptin, the hypocretinorexin system,
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.520]   which are systems within the body that signal to the brain
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.400]   that food is about to come,
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.240]   allowing those systems to adjust
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.200]   so that you're not overwhelmingly hungry, irritable,
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.400]   and you're not throwing your whole hormone system
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.720]   out of whack.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.000]   I keep coming back to this eight hour feeding window
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.200]   and I want to provide a little more basis for it
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.400]   and just to encourage that it's not completely arbitrary.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.120]   The lengthy review that I mentioned earlier
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.380]   features a number of studies
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.220]   that have used this eight hour feeding window,
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:08.240]   but there's a particular study that I'd like to highlight,
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.820]   mainly because I don't expect people to delve
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.900]   into the full reference list of the other review.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.020]   And this is a study that was carried out
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:18.300]   between Sachin Panda's lab and Christopher Verity's lab.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.740]   So this is a collaboration.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.420]   The study was carried out in humans
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:24.580]   and is entitled effects of eight hour time restricted feeding
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:27.400]   on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.260]   in obese adults, excuse me.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.660]   And this study essentially showed,
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.780]   I'll just read the conclusions,
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:37.740]   that an eight hour time restricted feeding
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.140]   produces a mild caloric restriction and weight loss
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.700]   without calorie counting.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.020]   So that's key, right?
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:46.340]   These people aren't calorie counting.
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.360]   Somehow just by adhering to an eight hour window,
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:54.360]   they are taking in fewer calories than they're burning off
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.860]   and clinically it reduced blood pressure.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.840]   So I mentioned the study,
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.360]   not because there aren't many others
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:03.240]   involving the eight hour feeding window, also in humans,
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.880]   but because the eight hour feeding window
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.800]   has been tested in obese adults and non-obese adults.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:10.440]   And there are even a few studies in children.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.200]   So this eight hour window seems to be
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.160]   a really good rule of thumb and a kind of anchor
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.000]   around which we can each think about
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.900]   incorporating time restricted feeding.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:22.180]   There are of course, other patterns of feeding.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.520]   And while some people have engaged in longer fasts
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.060]   of 24 hours, 36 hours or more,
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.200]   alternate day fasting, meaning eating one day,
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.040]   not eating the next day, or in some cases,
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.320]   eating one day and eating very few calories,
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.420]   500 or 600 calories the next day has been tested.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:46.140]   A few studies have also looked at eating
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:48.380]   a sort of maintenance level of calories for five days
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:52.080]   and then taking two days and fasting clear through
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:55.860]   or eating very few calories, 300 or 500 calories.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.400]   In fact, there's a sort of a community online
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.260]   of people that are exploring longer fasts
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:03.200]   for sake of trying to offset dementia
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.500]   or reverse effects of dementia.
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:08.580]   Thus far, at least in my awareness,
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:12.220]   there isn't any quality clinical peer reviewed study
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.820]   on that yet for sake of dementia.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.020]   Although I await those studies
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.540]   and if anyone's aware of them,
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:19.740]   please send me a link in the comments.
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:22.740]   But alternate day fasting has gotten
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:24.540]   the so-called safe bill of health.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.680]   This has been written up,
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.460]   meaning that people didn't suffer bone loss.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:31.260]   They didn't suffer any major detrimental effects.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:35.940]   It does seem that it can create significant weight loss
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:38.600]   and can help with obese individuals,
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.820]   that it can reduce resting blood glucose.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:43.300]   And every other day fasting in many cases
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:46.200]   can produce more rapid effects on weight loss
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:49.380]   and reductions in blood glucose than time restricted feeding.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:53.940]   However, every other day type fasting for most people
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:56.120]   is not going to be feasible.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.540]   They're just not going to be able to do that
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.480]   for a long period of time.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.720]   And what hasn't really been done is the followup
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.340]   to see whether or not people who do every other day fasting
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:06.120]   or five days of eating followed by two days of fasting,
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.740]   whether or not that leads to a rebound in weight gain,
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.140]   whether or not that leads to a rebound
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.740]   in blood glucose, et cetera.
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.980]   So for now, the eight hour feeding window
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:18.580]   and time restricted feeding seems to be the most tested,
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:22.420]   supported in animal studies and in human studies,
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:25.660]   and the one around which I think most people should orient
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:28.240]   if they're considering getting into time restricted feeding.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.860]   It's also sort of hard to imagine how one could include
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:35.760]   a significant exercise schedule or work schedule
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.100]   on every other day fasting.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:40.300]   Remember, in any study, people are often being compensated
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.960]   or at least are incentivized in some way
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.820]   to adhere to the study.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:47.260]   This is one of the major issues that I have with any study
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:49.500]   that says that three or four different diets
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.560]   are essentially equal in terms of their ability
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.040]   to produce weight loss.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:57.160]   Adherence is very different in the outside world
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.260]   where you don't have a researcher monitoring you,
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.080]   where you're not logging all your food.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:03.240]   Most people don't do that consistently.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.380]   And we can take a little bit of a neuroscience perspective
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:07.560]   on this to try and arrive at what the best kind
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.960]   of organization of an eating plan, or if we wanted
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.300]   to call it a diet, we could, would be for you.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.360]   Many people find it easier to just not eat
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.060]   for certain periods of each 24 hour cycle
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.600]   than to eat smaller portions.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.520]   Portion control is very hard for some people.
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.980]   For other people, it's manageable.
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:30.640]   But people like me, I don't eat half the croissant.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.280]   I don't think it's a real thing.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.320]   It's not available to me, I should say.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.080]   Now, of course I could eat just half a croissant,
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.740]   but I noticed that when I eat the croissant,
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:41.280]   because they're so delicious,
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:43.680]   that it creates a rise in blood glucose,
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.480]   a rise in the other hormones and chemicals
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.420]   that are associated with ingesting delicious,
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.120]   highly palatable food.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.220]   And it's actually a lot of work for me
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:54.480]   to just eat half the croissant.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.840]   There's something that's much more thoroughly satisfying
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.680]   about eating the entire croissant.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.360]   And actually there's something that's somewhat satisfying
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.120]   about not eating the croissant at all.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.400]   And just knowing that later I can eat the whole croissant.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.360]   Now that's me.
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.560]   Other people find that they don't have any trouble
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.000]   with portion control.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.820]   That for them, just eating small bits of food
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.340]   throughout the day is what sets them
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.600]   in the right psychological and physical state
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.040]   for sake of work, et cetera.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.000]   And I mentioned work and mental focus
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.320]   because one of the aspects of fasting
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.040]   that have drawn a lot of people
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:28.320]   to time restricted feeding and fasting
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.480]   is the clarity of mind that people get.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:34.000]   When first of all, they don't have to think about
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:34.840]   when they're going to eat,
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:37.320]   because they know when their eating window begins.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.680]   They also don't have to think about
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.760]   regulating their behavior
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.160]   because they already know when they're going to eat
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.200]   and when they're not going to eat.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.320]   Whereas when you're restricting portions,
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.960]   you actually have to make decisions all the while.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.280]   You know, and I think I, like many people decide,
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:53.360]   well, you know, is that exactly half?
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.600]   Or could I have like another rung on the croissant?
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.420]   This kind of thing.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:57.680]   I don't negotiate with food.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.440]   That's why I like a time restricted feeding window.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.920]   I know I'm going to eat for, in my case,
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.400]   I use a 10 hour feeding window or so,
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.760]   and I'll eat the whole croissant.
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.840]   I just don't have to think about it.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.120]   Now, the food choices that you make
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:11.280]   inside of that feeding window
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   are of course also going to be very important.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.080]   Certain foods will increase blood glucose
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.880]   such that you're going to get hungrier and hungrier.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:19.120]   Others will maintain lower blood glucose
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.960]   and will allow you to be more controlled
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.980]   in the foods that you pursue.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.800]   Those are all individual considerations
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.200]   that are deserving of their own entire episode.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.100]   But I do want to point out that the advantage
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:33.680]   of time restricted feeding is that it involves
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:35.700]   a lot of the decision-making in the brain,
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:39.320]   the so-called go, no-go circuitries of our basal ganglia,
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.360]   if you want to know those areas that control them.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.640]   Anytime we have to restrict a behavior,
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.540]   that's called a no-go.
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.320]   Anytime we engage in a behavior, that's a go.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.800]   No-go behaviors require a lot of what's called
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.880]   top-down control, and it's very metabolically demanding.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.780]   And so time restricted feeding allows you to depart
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.380]   from the whole no-go go negotiation
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:03.560]   that you have to undergo when you have to restrict portions.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.240]   And so I think this is a reason why many people
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.600]   have gravitated towards time restricted feeding
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.040]   and why for people that don't want to have to think
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.960]   about all that, it's just very straightforward.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.120]   One of the more hot button issues out there
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:19.400]   is whether or not given equal amounts of caloric intake
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:23.040]   and equal amounts of activity
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.440]   and equal amounts of nutrients, et cetera,
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.980]   whether or not restricting food to a particular window
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:32.580]   biases more weight loss toward fat loss
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.180]   versus loss of other tissues.
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:35.300]   'Cause of course, when we lose weight,
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.320]   we can lose that from any number of different
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.280]   storage sites within the body,
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:44.280]   muscle, water, glycogen, or fat.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.040]   Now, this is such a hot button issue
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.140]   that I almost don't want to get into it,
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:49.360]   but I'm going to get into it anyway,
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.240]   because there are data that are very interesting.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.540]   This is covered in the review that I mentioned earlier
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:50:00.160]   that describes how if people follow
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.920]   a time restricted feeding schedule
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:05.880]   for long periods of time, so 60 days or longer,
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.600]   there are some metabolic changes in the way
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:10.840]   that people metabolize energy
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.640]   that do seem to shift the system toward more fat loss
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.120]   relative to burning of other tissues
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.120]   when in a state of caloric restriction.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.640]   And I want to say when in a state of caloric restriction,
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.920]   because there's really no way to cheat the system,
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:26.200]   there's no way that you can ingest far more calories
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.080]   than you burn or excrete.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.360]   When I say excrete, I certainly don't suggest this,
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:34.080]   but there, bulimics and other people
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.880]   that have eating disorders will use laxatives
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.100]   as a way to eliminate food quickly from their system
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.680]   so it can't be converted into fat or other forms of energy.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:45.480]   That's a very, in that case, it's a pathological situation,
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:48.000]   but in general, calories in versus calories out,
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.680]   as I mentioned earlier, is this kind of foundational element
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.260]   but in states of caloric restriction,
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:55.340]   meaning sub maintenance intake,
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:59.920]   time restricted feeding does seem to buy us
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:04.880]   more of the energy burned to compensate for that deficit
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.560]   from fat and the way it accomplishes it is very interesting.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.440]   It turns out that it drives more fat loss
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.160]   by way of increasing a hepatic lipase.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.800]   This is something called LIPC,
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.280]   hepatic means of the liver and lipase,
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:22.320]   which anytime you hear A-S-E means it's an enzyme.
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.840]   So it seems to increase hepatic lipase.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:28.280]   So it increases the enzyme that metabolizes fat
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.240]   for lipolysis and energy production
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:34.400]   and reduces something called CIDEC, C-I-D-E-C,
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.620]   which is a lipid droplet associated and lipolysis inhibitor.
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:41.240]   Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended,
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:44.440]   but what CIDEC really is,
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:47.440]   this lipid droplet associated molecule,
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.380]   is it can inhibit lipolysis.
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:54.340]   So extended periods of time restricted feeding,
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:57.940]   meaning eight hour feeding window or 10 hour feeding window
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:01.400]   that's obeyed for several months or more
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:06.400]   seems to allow the system to shift toward burning more fat
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:10.840]   or rather using a higher percentage of fat
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.160]   when in a caloric deficit.
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.580]   Now, I doubt that this is going to resolve
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:18.560]   the truly barbed wire, almost hairball,
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.400]   ridiculous online debates about
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.780]   whether or not time restricted feeding
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.340]   is better than another feeding schedule.
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:25.460]   Look, I don't think any particular feeding schedule
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.460]   is holy.
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:29.200]   If you are sub caloric, meaning fewer calories burned
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.560]   than calories ingested, you're going to lose weight.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.700]   But the data seemed to point to the fact that
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.260]   if you do time restricted feeding
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:39.000]   for a fairly long duration of time and you maintain that,
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.060]   that you are increasing these lipases
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:45.820]   that increase lipolysis, energy use from fat,
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:48.160]   and you're decreasing the lipid droplet
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:50.320]   associated lipolysis inhibitors.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:53.080]   So it's both a, you're removing the break
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.820]   and you're pressing on the accelerator of fat loss.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:00.820]   I think that this logically points to a case in which
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:05.180]   using time restricted feeding with a sub caloric intake
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:07.220]   seems to be, at least to my mind,
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:09.300]   the most scientifically supported way
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.980]   to ensure that a significant portion of the weight
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.520]   that one loses is from body fat stores.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.700]   Any discussion about fasting would be incomplete
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:20.580]   without a discussion about what does
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:23.100]   and does not break a fast.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:26.060]   However, there is no black and white answer
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.020]   to that question.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.820]   And you should immediately understand why.
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:33.820]   It's because eating and not eating
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:36.660]   are not equivalent to fed and fasted.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:40.640]   It depends on when you ate, how much you ate,
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.760]   and where you are in your circadian cycle.
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:46.780]   We can actually arrive at a simple answer
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:49.140]   to whether or not something breaks the fast or not.
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:51.020]   Now, the technical way to go about this would be
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:53.300]   to wear a continuous glucose monitor
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.220]   and to ingest little bits of food of different kinds
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.260]   or large amounts of food of different kinds
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:53:59.820]   and measure blood glucose,
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:02.860]   because ultimately blood glucose is the readout
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:05.380]   of whether or not your system is in a fed or fasted state.
[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.940]   There are other parameters too, of course,
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.560]   but that's the dominant one.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:13.440]   Insofar as the scientific literature says,
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:17.560]   drinking water will not break your fast.
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.640]   Drinking tea will not break your fast.
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.900]   Drinking coffee provided it is black coffee
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.300]   will not break your fast.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:30.820]   Ingesting caffeine in pill form will not break your fast.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.160]   There are other things that won't break your fast.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:37.140]   For instance, eating one peanut when deep in a fasted state
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:38.840]   will not break your fast.
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.260]   Eating a whole handful of peanuts
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:41.760]   might not even break your fast
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.720]   if you are in a very low glucose state.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.300]   However, if you just finished a meal
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:47.960]   that included carbohydrates
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:52.000]   or it was a very large meal of any kind an hour ago,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.800]   yes, indeed, eating one peanut could break your fast.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.840]   So it's all contextual.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.720]   That's what's really important to understand.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:02.780]   Unless you're going to wear a continuous glucose monitor
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:05.860]   and unless you're going to wear a continuous glucose monitor
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:08.900]   and set an absolute numerical threshold
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.340]   for what it is to break your fast,
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:14.100]   I think there are some simple rules that we can follow.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:19.040]   First of all, anything that involves sugar,
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.500]   in particular, simple sugars
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:21.820]   can potentially break your fast.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:23.380]   And there's actually a study on this,
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:28.380]   which shows that if people ingest even one gram of sugar
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:33.400]   post dinner, if they had a full meal for dinner,
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.120]   that can actually disrupt the expression
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.660]   of some of the circadian genes related to fasting
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.920]   and to sleep and sleep-related fasting.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:43.180]   Now that's pretty extreme.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:45.480]   It's almost kind of scary to think about,
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.540]   but that's how sensitive our system is
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:50.720]   if we already have somewhat elevated blood glucose
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:53.400]   from a meal that we ate an hour or so ago.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.120]   Whereas if we have run for an hour or trained hard,
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.480]   high intensity training, and we haven't quite reached
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:04.400]   the beginning of our so-called feeding window,
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.400]   will eating a small amount of food take us out of that fast?
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:11.880]   Well, depends on what the food is.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.640]   If it's mostly fat, probably not.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:15.960]   A number of people out there nowadays
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.700]   talk about so-called fat fasting.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.920]   Fat fasting is a way to kind of wriggle past
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:25.240]   the stringency of either eating or not eating
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.200]   as a black and white rule for feeding window
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:29.600]   versus non-feeding window.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.400]   So some people will ingest medium chain triglycerides,
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:36.760]   so-called MCTs, or people will ingest fats only
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.920]   until their official feeding window begins.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.840]   So these are sort of how the negotiations
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:42.880]   that people carry out tend to go.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.720]   But fat, of course, won't increase blood glucose
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.880]   and insulin as much as carbohydrates will.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.900]   Protein will have sort of an intermediate effect.
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:53.120]   And as I mentioned earlier, ingesting carbohydrates
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.060]   with some fat will tend to blunt the rise in glucose
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:00.380]   and will extend the duration over which glucose is released.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:05.380]   So we really can't say food X or beverage X breaks a fast.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:09.880]   However, at the extremes, we can say that.
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.700]   For instance, if you drink a can of soda pop,
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:16.040]   unless you just ran an ultra marathon,
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.760]   you're breaking your fast, okay?
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:19.960]   You eat a piece of pizza, you're breaking your fast.
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.620]   If you eat purely fats, maybe, probably not.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:27.020]   If you've been fasting for five hours or more,
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:29.100]   strictly fasting for five hours or more.
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:32.040]   So you can start to see where there's a lot of wiggle room
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.520]   and it's very contextual.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.120]   And this is why any posts that you see
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.180]   or any information that you see that something does
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:40.120]   or does not break your fast that doesn't place it
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.520]   in the context of when the last time you ate
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.320]   and what you ate and your activity and your time
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:50.480]   within the circadian clock schedule of 24 hours,
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.520]   it's a sort of meaningless discussion.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:54.760]   So in general, I think what's really useful,
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.540]   if you're not going to wear a continuous glucose monitor,
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:57:59.760]   is to try and be fairly strict
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.720]   about when you initiate your feeding window
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:03.400]   and when you stop your feeding window.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:06.820]   And as time evolves and you establish a more regular routine
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:08.600]   of eating certain kinds of foods and not others
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:09.440]   that are right for you,
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:11.660]   'cause as I've emphasized before on this podcast,
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.160]   and I will continue to emphasize,
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.160]   keto works great for some people,
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.240]   vegetarian keto works great for some people,
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.240]   carnivore diet works great for other people.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:22.640]   Some people are omnivores, some people are carnivores,
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:24.480]   some people are vegan.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.280]   All of that is great and fine by me.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.980]   Everyone has to establish what's right for them.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:31.280]   Today, we've really bypassed the discussion
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:34.720]   about foods of a particular origin or type,
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:36.260]   animal-based or plant-based,
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:39.620]   but all the same rules apply within this thing
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:41.480]   that we're call intermittent fasting
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:42.760]   or time-restricted feeding.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:46.540]   So what breaks a fast will depend and what you want to eat
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:48.200]   or what you are willing to eat,
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:51.320]   that's a totally separate manner from when you eat.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:55.200]   But as we've established, when you eat is vitally important.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.800]   Some of you are probably wondering whether or not
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:01.480]   artificial sweeteners or non-artificial plant-based
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.400]   sweeteners like Stevia break a fast.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.880]   This will vary somewhat.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:10.680]   And I have to say the data on this are somewhat mixed.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:14.320]   There is evidence that when people ingest
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:17.820]   artificial sweeteners, that it can create a transient
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:21.400]   increase in blood glucose followed by a transient decrease
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.880]   in blood glucose below baseline.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:26.300]   This is thought to explain the increase in hunger
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:29.100]   caused by ingestion of things like aspartame and sucralose
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:30.360]   and things of that sort.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:33.040]   There are not a lot of good studies exploring
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:36.360]   the plant-based non-sugar sweeteners,
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:39.340]   things like Stevia, even things like monk fruit,
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.680]   which is a separate category into itself.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:43.040]   There aren't a lot of studies on this.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.540]   I think most people need to establish this for themselves.
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:47.800]   The best way of course would be to wear a continuous glucose
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.680]   monitor to go into a fasted state of either one hour
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:52.600]   or two hours, or maybe you've been fasting all night
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.600]   and then ingest Stevia in whatever form you want
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:59.000]   or coffee in whatever form you want with sucralose
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.440]   or aspartame, et cetera,
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.880]   setting aside the discussion about the effects
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.720]   of these things on the gut microbiome,
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:07.180]   which is a different topic entirely.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:10.020]   I think it's fair to say that in moderation,
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:13.800]   the plant-based non-sugar sweeteners like Stevia,
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:17.160]   in particular, Stevia, seem to have a minimal impact
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:19.280]   on overall blood glucose when considered
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:20.920]   over a fairly large time bin.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:24.660]   Aspartame and sucralose, saccharin,
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.060]   I think we can say more or less the same,
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:27.940]   but as soon as you get into a discussion about those,
[02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:29.420]   you also have to get into a discussion
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:32.940]   about some of the evidence published in nature
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:35.140]   and other excellent journals now,
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:37.900]   pointing to the fact that when consumed in excess,
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:39.980]   not when consumed in moderation,
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:41.200]   but when consumed in excess,
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.900]   that those might have some detrimental effects
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:44.560]   on the gut microbiome.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:48.240]   So do artificial sweeteners break a fast?
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.360]   Depends on the amount, depends on the type.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.960]   And in general, I think you're probably okay,
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.160]   provided that you're not indulging in them too often.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:57.760]   However, some people,
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:00.400]   just by virtue of tasting something sweet,
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.780]   feel a spike in their appetite that makes it harder
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:04.720]   for them to adhere to the feeding window.
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:06.460]   And so this is why you can imagine
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:08.940]   that a really well-controlled study on this
[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:10.260]   would be very hard to carry out.
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:12.580]   And I'm not really sure that it's worth our tax dollars
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:15.500]   to actually design and carry out a study like that,
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.140]   because there would be so much individual variation
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:21.380]   in terms of discipline in adhering to the feeding window,
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:23.700]   whether or not people experience increases and drops
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.300]   in blood glucose, how that impacts them,
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:26.340]   whether or not they're exercising,
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:29.940]   it just becomes an infinite variable space, as we say,
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:31.300]   in experimental science.
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.040]   So you really have to determine that for you,
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.480]   but I don't think that we can fairly say
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.620]   that artificial sweeteners break a fast.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:40.540]   I think that would be incorrect to say.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:43.460]   Earlier, we were talking about glucose disposal agents,
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:46.780]   both behavioral and compound-based things
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:48.160]   like metformin and berberine.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.100]   And in fact, cinnamon is even a mild glucose disposal agent.
[02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:54.300]   It can actually reduce blood glucose.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.600]   Lemon and lime juice, believe it or not,
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.500]   can lower blood glucose.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:01:59.780]   You may have experienced this before
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.460]   of eating something very, very sweet
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:03.000]   and almost feeling kind of overwhelmed
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.780]   and kind of poisoned by how sweet it is,
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.440]   especially if you're not accustomed
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:09.020]   to eating a lot of sugary things.
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:12.220]   One quick remedy for that is actually a half lime
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:15.060]   or a half lemon squeezed into juice and drinking that
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:18.980]   just by virtue of the taste and by virtue of the fact
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:20.940]   that it will reduce blood glucose,
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:22.220]   you'll notice that that effect
[02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:24.100]   almost immediately disappears.
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:25.180]   That's not magic.
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:28.900]   That's the effects of acidity on blood glucose levels.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.380]   So there are a number of things that can adjust
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:32.380]   blood glucose.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:34.060]   They're not necessarily disposal agents.
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:36.060]   They're not sweeping it out of the bloodstream
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.120]   in the same way that berberine or metformin would,
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:39.920]   or that high intensity exercise
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:41.640]   at the appropriate times of day would.
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.580]   But there is one particular thing that one can ingest
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:50.580]   that can help manage psychologically and performance wise
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:55.060]   through the fasting portion of the intermittent fasting
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:57.220]   and get you to your feeding window.
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:59.140]   And that's salt.
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:01.460]   I've talked a little bit about this on the podcast before,
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:06.380]   but because neurons use salt, sodium and potassium
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:07.220]   and magnesium,
[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:10.500]   the so-called electrolytes in order to perform their magic
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.140]   of chemical and electrical signaling,
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:13.560]   everything you do depends on chemical
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:15.480]   and electrical signaling and all that chemical
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:18.680]   and electrical signaling requires electrolytes
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:23.620]   in some form or another neurons run on the passage of ions
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:27.820]   like sodium in and out of their cell membranes,
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:31.240]   or I should say across their cell membranes to be accurate.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.020]   Many people find that the kind of lightheadedness,
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:36.420]   the shakiness that's accustomed
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:40.540]   with having slightly low blood sugar can be offset
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:44.620]   by taking a half teaspoon or so of sea salt,
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:46.300]   or even just a tiny pinch of salt
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:48.980]   and putting into some water and drinking it.
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:54.300]   Some people find because of the glucose lowering effects
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:56.420]   of acidity, that if they're feeling kind of shaky
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:59.140]   and not well, and they put some lemon juice into water
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:01.880]   and drink that it drops their blood glucose further.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.320]   So there's a common practice nowadays
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.000]   that's discussed on the internet of waking up,
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.660]   drinking some water with some lime or lemon juice in it
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:09.960]   with a little pinch of salt.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.100]   I think that little pinch of salt is a good idea.
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:12.940]   What is it doing?
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:14.120]   How is it offsetting all this?
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:18.040]   Well, salt water actually has a mild effect
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.020]   as a glucose disposal agent,
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:23.400]   but it has a stabilizing effect on blood volume.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.800]   And so because sodium brings with it water
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.660]   and the so-called osmolarity of your blood and your body
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:35.660]   depends on the salt levels in your blood and brain and body.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:38.040]   Many people find that if they're feeling shaky,
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.800]   they're feeling lightheaded, they can't concentrate.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.400]   They think they need sugar or food,
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.520]   but what will actually remedy that is some salt.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.700]   And I know a number of people
[02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:47.040]   that have incorporated this practice
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.560]   and have written to me and saying, oh, you know,
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:50.780]   if I just take a little bit of salt and some water,
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:52.500]   they may or may not include the lemon or lime juice.
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:54.020]   They immediately feel better
[02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:56.060]   and find that it's actually quite straightforward
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:58.060]   to get out to that,
[02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:00.640]   to wait until the feeding window kicks in.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:03.940]   This is especially true for people that are using caffeine
[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:05.180]   because when you ingest caffeine,
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:08.300]   you actually excrete a lot of water as a diuretic effect.
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.160]   And with that water goes salt.
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:12.580]   So it actually causes you to excrete sodium.
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:16.420]   Now, the role of sodium in blood pressure and hypertension
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:18.780]   is quite controversial.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:19.640]   Science Magazine,
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:23.460]   one of the premier scientific journals out there
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:26.020]   had a special issue all about salt some years ago
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:28.580]   talking about the research around hypertension.
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:30.540]   Indeed, people with chronic hypertension
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:32.500]   or high blood pressure or very high blood pressure
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:35.500]   in particular should be wary of ingesting too much sodium.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:38.420]   But for most people ingesting sodium,
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:40.500]   provided they drink enough water
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.400]   and they don't have chronic hypertension
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:45.860]   or high blood pressure is actually beneficial.
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:47.220]   That doesn't mean you should be drinking seawater.
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:50.300]   Doesn't mean you should be overindulging in salt,
[02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:53.700]   but many people find that they can manage their mental
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:56.460]   and physical state and even feel really terrific,
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:00.020]   real clarity of mind and really enjoy their fast
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:01.660]   when they're ingesting sufficient salt.
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.660]   And all it requires really is a small pinch of salt,
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.000]   ideally Himalayan or sea salt,
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.140]   if you want to get fancy about it,
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:08.060]   but table salt would be fine.
[02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:11.140]   And just drinking that in some water,
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:12.320]   maybe with lemon or lime juice
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.500]   to offset the taste a little bit
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:17.500]   can really stabilize one's jitters
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:19.140]   and can stabilize the mind.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:23.720]   And you might also notice can offset that churning
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:26.660]   and yearning and appetite where you can't imagine
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.580]   going another five minutes before eating something,
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.500]   suddenly you feel okay.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.420]   And that has to do with a lot of the effects of blood volume
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:35.360]   caused by ingesting salt in the appropriate amounts.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:38.160]   In other words, sometimes you think you need food,
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.580]   but what you really need is salt
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:41.940]   and salt can make you feel better immediately.
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:45.260]   I'd like to mention two excellent zero cost resources.
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:47.620]   If you're going to explore time restricted feeding,
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.840]   or maybe if you already are doing time restricted feeding,
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:53.800]   I have no affiliation to either of these.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:55.860]   The first is the website that I mentioned before,
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:56.980]   My Circadian Clock,
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:07:00.400]   which is the website hosted by Sachin Panda and colleagues.
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.860]   There are a lot of resources there
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:03.460]   where you can log your food intake,
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:05.260]   get information about time restricted feeding,
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:08.260]   all the science, the ongoing studies, et cetera.
[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:10.940]   The other is the so-called Zero app
[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:14.220]   that makes it very easy to
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:17.540]   mark when you're beginning your feeding,
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:19.440]   window and when you're ending your feeding window.
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.560]   And in so doing,
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.360]   marking when you are beginning your fast
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:23.340]   and ending your fast,
[02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:27.580]   or at least initiating the beginning of the unfed state,
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:29.560]   as we could more accurately call it.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:30.580]   It's a terrific app.
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:31.960]   I've used it from time to time.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.900]   I don't tend to use it in an ongoing basis
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.580]   because I'm just sort of used to eating
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.620]   at a particular time of day now.
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:41.240]   But anytime I've shifted that window,
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:42.880]   for instance, a few weeks ago,
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.660]   I started moving that protein intake
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:47.160]   in my entire feeding window earlier in the day.
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.940]   And because that takes some attention on my part,
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:51.640]   because I'm not used to doing that,
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:54.080]   I've been using the Zero app and I like it quite a lot.
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.080]   It logs your progress and it gives you averages
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.860]   and you can see how many other people are fasting.
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:59.380]   Again, totally zero cost.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:01.120]   I actually don't know who owns that app,
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:03.120]   but I think they've done an excellent job.
[02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:04.580]   The interface is really terrific.
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:07.340]   And as far as I know, it's available for Apple and Android,
[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:09.320]   but it's at least available for Apple phones,
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.460]   which is the type of phone I happen to have.
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:13.140]   So check those out.
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:15.500]   My circadian clock, you just put that into Google,
[02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:17.460]   you'll find it and the Zero app,
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:20.520]   both excellent zero cost resources.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.860]   In a moment, I'd like to review the parameters
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:26.900]   of a ideal feeding schedule for you
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:29.020]   and give you the variables that you can plug in
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:31.540]   to your lifestyle and your preferences.
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:33.020]   There are a couple of things that I would place
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:36.220]   into the category of frequently asked,
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:40.100]   somewhat odd, but still worthy of discussion.
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:42.600]   For instance, people have asked,
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:45.640]   will brushing your teeth with toothpaste break your fast?
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.540]   I think unless you're swallowing the toothpaste, no.
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:50.820]   Now, if you really want to run out
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:53.020]   and get a continuous glucose monitor and brush your teeth
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:55.320]   and you can evaluate that, but no.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:59.620]   People have asked, will a half glass of wine after dinner,
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.640]   a couple hours after dinner, break your fast?
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.840]   Absolutely.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.700]   It absolutely will.
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:05.920]   And it's been demonstrated to do that
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:08.640]   based on the one gram of sugar,
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:11.800]   kind of eerie or scary effect that I talked about before.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:15.140]   Scary and eerie because it just seems like one gram of sugar.
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:15.980]   How could it do that?
[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:18.160]   But these are metabolic processes
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.780]   and they are very sensitive post meal.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:22.800]   A few months back,
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:26.460]   I did an experiment wearing a continuous glucose monitor.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.240]   And I got a surprise when I discovered
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:32.460]   that going into a sauna increases my blood glucose
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:33.300]   quite a bit.
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.500]   It actually spikes it as high as a meal.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:37.820]   And then it tends to drop back down to baseline
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:40.640]   or even slightly below baseline afterwards.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:43.820]   When I talk to people about this, somebody said,
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:46.780]   oh, it's got to be that the continuous glucose monitor
[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:48.840]   was getting disrupted by the heat in the sauna.
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:50.720]   That's actually not the case.
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.020]   Turns out that when you go in a sauna,
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:57.660]   because you dehydrate, you're losing water.
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:10:00.320]   I wasn't drinking water and you're dropping a lot of water.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:03.520]   The concentration of sugar in your blood actually goes up.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:06.160]   And I actually put these data out
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:08.460]   in a social media post on Twitter.
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:11.100]   And people were kind of shocked to see how much
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.320]   a sauna can spike your blood glucose.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:15.760]   Now I do practice time restricted feeding,
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:16.600]   intermittent fasting.
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:17.900]   I'm not super strict about it.
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:21.340]   I use a kind of eight to 10 hour ish window,
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:23.700]   either early in the day or late in the day.
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.560]   I saw this effect of the sauna.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:30.460]   Personally, the psychological and physical health effects
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:33.140]   of the sauna are valuable enough to me
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:34.460]   that I continue to use it.
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.420]   I just not concerned about this increase in blood glucose
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:39.560]   to the extent that I'm going to eliminate sauna.
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.620]   I like to use the sauna three or four times
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:43.240]   a week before sleep.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:44.840]   So I'll use it an hour or two before sleep.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.020]   And yes, indeed, it creates this big spike
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:49.580]   in blood glucose that then drops based on change
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:51.860]   in the concentration of blood sugar.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.000]   I'm just not going to worry about it.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.760]   Now, if you're concerned about blood glucose spikes,
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:57.440]   then you might be worried about it.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:59.360]   But in my case, it was one of those things
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:02.820]   where it was interesting and it was worthy of discussion,
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.580]   I thought, because it was somewhat surprising to me,
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:06.820]   although it makes perfect sense why this would be the case.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:09.340]   But at the end of the day, literally,
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:11.800]   it just makes sense for me to get in the sauna.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:13.660]   Okay, so now you've heard a lot of science.
[02:11:13.660 --> 02:11:17.000]   You've heard a lot of examples, even a few anecdotes.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.000]   And let's come up with the ideal intermittent fasting,
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.460]   AKA time-restricted feeding schedule for you.
[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:28.380]   And when I say ideal, I mean,
[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.680]   what are the variables that are negotiable?
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:33.320]   What are the ones that are non-negotiable?
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:36.380]   What is ideal for you will depend on the context
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:40.140]   of your life and what you are willing to do consistently.
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:42.980]   So first of all,
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:46.100]   we established based on the discussion with Sachin,
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:49.820]   who is truly the premier world expert in this area,
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:53.580]   who knows the animal and human scientific literature
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:56.260]   better than anybody has written this incredible review.
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:12:01.260]   And for whom I consulted that you do not want to ingest food
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:05.700]   for at least, I want to emphasize at least 60 minutes
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:06.760]   post waking up.
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:12.380]   Second, you want to avoid ingesting any food
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:15.240]   of any kind, even one gram of sugar.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:16.980]   Remember, this is the ideal.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:19.620]   One gram of sugar even would be too much
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:22.860]   for the two to three hours prior to bedtime.
[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:26.020]   He also mentioned, ideally,
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:28.460]   you are spending eight hours in bed.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:29.460]   I didn't tell you that earlier.
[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:31.020]   I saved that for now,
[02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:34.400]   but ideally you are sleeping that entire eight hours,
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.740]   but simply by being in bed for that eight hours
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:39.040]   and avoiding food after waking for an hour
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:42.640]   and before bed for two to three hours,
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:44.220]   you're starting to build out the duration
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:46.020]   of this fasted period.
[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:52.060]   Remember that the sleep related fasting
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:54.700]   is particularly important for the health benefits
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:56.800]   of time restricted feeding.
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.860]   Again, the sleep related fasting is especially important
[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:03.560]   because of all the cellular repair processes
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:06.420]   that occur in the liver, in the gut, in the microbiome,
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:08.820]   in the brain, all over the body.
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:11.060]   And because of the way that that coordinates the expression
[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:14.300]   of the clock genes that are then going to wick out
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:17.680]   and have many other positive effects on health,
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:20.540]   including weight and fat loss.
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:23.100]   But in addition to that, liver health, et cetera.
[02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:28.100]   An eight hour feeding window as a target
[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:31.900]   seems to be the best target feeding window,
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:33.680]   at least by my read of the literature
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.000]   and in discussing it with such in.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.280]   Shorter feeding windows of four to six hours
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.200]   tend to lead to overeating
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.420]   and potentially increases in weight.
[02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:48.340]   One meal per day type eating do not seem to do that,
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:52.100]   but those are special cases in that most people
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:55.800]   can't adhere to a one meal per day type schedule,
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.120]   at least not on a regular basis.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.080]   And it's not very compatible with most social schedules.
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:02.480]   Although some people may be able to adhere to that
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.320]   in a straightforward way,
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:06.680]   but there aren't any robust studies exploring
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:09.360]   the advantages of one meal per day.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:12.560]   So if you feel there are advantages of one meal per day
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:16.020]   for you, as opposed to an eight hour feeding window,
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:19.500]   well then by all means use a one meal per day approach
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:22.160]   or use a four to six hour feeding window
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:24.800]   and just make sure you don't overeat in that window.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:30.400]   Remember that most people tend to not adhere
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:31.620]   to the eight hour feeding window.
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:32.820]   They say eight hours,
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:35.400]   but they tend to eat outside of the eight hours,
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.100]   a little bit on each side.
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:41.340]   So if your goal is a 10 hour feeding window,
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:44.260]   you might want to set it to nine hours or eight hours.
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:45.500]   If your goal is six hours,
[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:47.580]   you might want to set it to seven or eight hours.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:49.980]   And this is simply based, or I shouldn't say simply,
[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:52.460]   this is based on thousands,
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:56.700]   if not tens of thousands of human subject data points
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:58.800]   that Sachin and colleagues have collected.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.260]   Regular placement of the eating window
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:08.260]   or feeding window every 24 hours is important.
[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:10.300]   You don't have to be absolutely rigid
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:11.780]   and neurotic about this,
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.020]   but you don't want it sliding around on the weekend
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:15.620]   so that it's starting two hours later
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:18.980]   and ending two hours later, a couple of days a week,
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:22.980]   because then you start to offset many of the positive health
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:24.860]   effects that have been demonstrated
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:26.220]   for time restricted feeding.
[02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:31.220]   Remember if you eat your food
[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:32.900]   within a certain feeding window,
[02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:36.080]   but that feeding window shifts by a couple hours,
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.620]   it is effectively like jet lagging your system.
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:43.100]   It is effectively like traveling a couple of time zones over
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.180]   eating there for a few days and coming back
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:47.760]   when in fact you're not traveling.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.540]   And that's because of the way that food
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:52.660]   adjusts the circadian clock genes.
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:55.480]   Now you can offset some of that through the use of light.
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:58.000]   And I've talked extensively about how to use light
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.280]   in previous podcasts, but again,
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:02.580]   early morning and all day bright light exposure
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.480]   as safely as you can, ideally from sunlight,
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:05.980]   not through a window, et cetera,
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.780]   avoiding bright light in the middle of the night,
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:10.600]   extremely important for mood offsetting,
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:13.060]   metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.
[02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:17.060]   Not incidentally, Sachin's early work
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:19.920]   was he was one of the three co-discoverers
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.400]   of the cells in the eye, the so-called melanopsin cells
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:24.760]   that set the central circadian clock.
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:26.180]   So he was a pioneer in that field,
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:28.920]   which led him to be a pioneer in this field and so on.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:33.260]   When should that eight hour window be placed
[02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:35.180]   within each 24 hour cycle?
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:36.760]   Well, let's talk about ideal.
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.440]   Ideal, if you really want to maximize
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:44.440]   all the health benefits of time restricted feeding,
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:50.120]   you need to extend the fast around sleep on both sides.
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:52.680]   You would place it smack dab in the middle of the day.
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:55.740]   It would be a schedule in which you started eating,
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:17:00.740]   for instance, at 10 AM and you stopped eating at 6 PM.
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:03.340]   An absolutely dreadful schedule for anyone
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:06.140]   that wants to have some semblance of a normal life.
[02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:08.820]   In my opinion, it's not really compatible
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:09.880]   with most schedules,
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:11.760]   although some people might be able to do it.
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.560]   Maybe you and your family or your friends,
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:16.620]   you're eating a late breakfast
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:20.120]   and then you're having a late-ish lunch around 2 PM
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.180]   and then you have dinner at six.
[02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:26.860]   And then assuming that you go to bed around 9.30 or 10 PM,
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:30.800]   that is going to extract the maximum amount
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:33.240]   of weight related, body fat related,
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:38.680]   metabolic factor related aspects of time restricted feeding.
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.180]   Some people tend to fall into a category
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:44.880]   where they do best placing that feeding window
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:48.740]   later in the day and provided it doesn't run
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:49.660]   too close to your sleep.
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:51.360]   Remember you needed a two or three hour buffer
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.780]   before your sleep where you're not ingesting anything.
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:56.380]   That's in order to extract the benefits
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:57.780]   of time restricted feeding.
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:01.900]   Well, then starting your feeding window at 12 PM
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:06.200]   and ending at 8 PM plus or minus half an hour or so,
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:09.400]   day-to-day seems like a perfectly reasonable schedule
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.440]   for some people starting at 2 PM and ending at 10 PM
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:13.600]   will be that schedule.
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:16.620]   Of course, you have to take into consideration
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:19.840]   when you exercise, if you exercise.
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:23.240]   For instance, I like to exercise early in the day if I run
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:26.560]   or if I do some moderate or light intensity exercise,
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.440]   regardless of what type of exercise it is,
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:32.280]   I have no trouble waiting until my feeding window kicks in
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:34.440]   around noon or even 2 PM.
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:37.200]   But if I do high intensity weight training, for instance,
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:40.800]   early in the day, or if I run sprints and I do that at 7 AM
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:44.720]   or 8 AM by 11 AM, I am very, very hungry.
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:47.000]   And it's hard for me to do other things,
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.460]   concentrate, et cetera.
[02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:50.740]   Now I'm not neurotic about my feeding window.
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:51.580]   As I mentioned before,
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:53.880]   I kind of let it expand and contract a bit
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:56.480]   around the eight hour mark and feel perfectly free
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:57.320]   to do that too.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.880]   We're talking here in ideals,
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.800]   not in necessarily practicals,
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.520]   but other people find that they're very hungry
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.240]   when they wake up early in the day.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:08.340]   If you're one of these people,
[02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:11.740]   or you're somebody who really is trying to emphasize
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:14.640]   hypertrophy or maintenance of muscle,
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:17.740]   then it does seem that ingesting protein early in the day
[02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:21.880]   is beneficial, that it can be more readily converted
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:23.640]   into muscle tissue.
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:26.480]   And this has been demonstrated in at least one study.
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:27.720]   There's another study underway
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:30.960]   that's exploring this further for people that are really,
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:33.100]   really interested in hypertrophy and building muscle well,
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:36.000]   then time-restricted feeding is usually not the way they go.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.520]   I mean, let's be honest.
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:39.800]   There are many people out there who are eating
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:41.320]   four more meals per day,
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:44.680]   and they're doing that from 7 AM until 8 PM.
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.360]   I realized that not everybody is overweight.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:48.800]   There is an obesity crisis indeed.
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:50.000]   The percentage of obesity
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.400]   and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:53.760]   is just cosmic through the roof,
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:56.920]   at least in this country and in other countries as well.
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:59.560]   This country, me in the US, but other countries as well.
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:03.140]   But there are, of course, people that are trying
[02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:05.460]   to gain weight or who don't want to lose weight
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:07.880]   or who are trying to maximize physical performance
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:09.440]   or hypertrophy or things of that sort.
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:12.040]   And so of course, time-restricted feeding for them
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.680]   might be as long as I'm awake, I'm eating.
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:18.680]   And I tip my hat to those people and just say,
[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:20.360]   provided you understand what you're doing
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:21.700]   and the burden that that places
[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:23.580]   on some of the other processes in your body,
[02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:27.020]   if that's right for you, then by all means, pursue that.
[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:28.860]   Another thing that we can add to this summary
[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:32.100]   or key points related to time-restricted feeding
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:35.780]   is the use of glucose disposal agents and or behaviors.
[02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:40.460]   If you find that you've eaten too close to a period of time
[02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:42.140]   in which you would prefer to be fasting,
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:46.060]   that's when a 30 minute brisk walk or even modest walk
[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:49.560]   after eating can be beneficial.
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.980]   Ingesting some lemon juice or lime juice
[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:54.860]   can help lower blood glucose somewhat.
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:58.060]   And then there are the things like metformin and berberine.
[02:20:58.060 --> 02:20:59.340]   There are even some supplements out there
[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:02.100]   that combine things like berberine, cinnamon,
[02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:06.780]   which can lower blood glucose and things like chromium
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:09.140]   and things that have a mild effect on blood glucose.
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:14.140]   But berberine and metformin are very high potency
[02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:16.360]   glucose disposal agents.
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:18.700]   And I mentioned earlier why you would want to approach those
[02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:20.940]   with the appropriate level of caution
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:22.460]   and figure out the dosages for you.
[02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:25.580]   And for some people, the dosages will be zero milligrams
[02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:27.040]   is going to be ideal.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:29.540]   And then of course, we discussed how making sure
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:32.240]   that you're ingesting enough fluids in particular water
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:35.660]   and salt, especially if you're using caffeine
[02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:38.080]   in order to increase your levels of alertness,
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:40.500]   regardless of where that caffeine source comes from coffee,
[02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:44.380]   tea or otherwise that can cause the excretion of sodium
[02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:47.740]   and can lead to a kind of shakiness, a lightheadedness
[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:50.980]   and the feelings of hunger that may or may not
[02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:52.660]   be related to blood glucose.
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:54.980]   Some people genuinely need to eat.
[02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:57.680]   I certainly would not want to see people getting hypoglycemic
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:59.120]   to the point where it's dangerous.
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:02.500]   Certainly if you are diabetic, you, and in fact,
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:06.260]   for all people, you should consult with your physician
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:09.200]   when exploring any major changes to diet or additions
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:11.840]   or subtractions of anything, including supplementation.
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:15.360]   But for most people, maintaining relatively low
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:19.080]   to modest blood glucose levels is going to be pretty healthy
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:21.740]   and will allow all the positive effects
[02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:25.200]   of intermittent fasting to occur.
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:28.700]   And when you find that reaching that start
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:30.940]   to the feeding window is challenging,
[02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:35.860]   that ingesting sodium can often stabilize your system
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:37.460]   mentally and physically and allow you
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:40.700]   to reach that window often painlessly.
[02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:43.660]   And then as a final point, as I mentioned earlier,
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:48.080]   provided that they are consumed in low, no,
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:52.760]   or modest amounts, artificial sweeteners or plant-based
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:56.240]   non-sugar non-caloric sweeteners don't seem
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.200]   to really impact blood glucose to the extent
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:01.520]   that it would quote unquote, take you out of your fast.
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:04.500]   But that like fat fasting is something that's going
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:06.640]   to be highly individual and that you're going to have
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:11.120]   to experiment with for yourself and being able to recognize
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:14.080]   when you're in a fast and when you're out of a fast
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:16.120]   at a subjective level and not constantly having
[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.720]   to measure your blood glucose or do things
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:20.640]   of that sort can be beneficial.
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:23.760]   And I think if you watch for the feelings associated
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.460]   with eating and post-eating foods of different kinds
[02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:29.060]   in different amounts, and you watch for the feelings
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:32.200]   associated with being fasted for long periods of time
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:35.600]   or short periods of time of having gotten sufficient
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:38.280]   sunlight of having trained hard or not trained hard
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:40.240]   earlier that day, et cetera,
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:41.460]   you can do the most important thing,
[02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:44.740]   which is to start to learn to evaluate your own system
[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:48.160]   to run simple, safe experiments on your system in a way
[02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:51.900]   that allows you to really establish the ideal nutrition
[02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:55.020]   schedule for you, whether it be time-restricted feeding,
[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:59.260]   AKA intermittent fasting, or some other nutritional plan.

[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:30.280]   on Instagram, there I do brief posts about science
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:33.000]   that often are not covered on the podcast.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.560]   So that's Huberman Lab on Instagram.
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:36.840]   We're also on Twitter, also at Huberman Lab.
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:40.080]   Recently, we launched a clips channel, Huberman Lab Clips.
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:42.720]   Please check out our clips channel and subscribe there
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:46.000]   for brief excerpts from the various Huberman Lab podcasts.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.100]   In addition, please check out our sponsors
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:50.440]   that we mentioned at the beginning of this episode.
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:52.840]   That's a terrific way to support the podcast.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:57.180]   We also have a Patreon, it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:59.140]   and there you can support the podcast
[02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:01.000]   at any level that you like.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.480]   During this episode and in many other previous episodes,
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:05.880]   I discussed supplements.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:08.340]   One issue with supplements and the supplement industry
[02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:12.520]   as a whole is that the quality and amounts of supplements
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:14.280]   often varies tremendously.
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.980]   Therefore, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:19.680]   because Thorne has the absolute highest levels of stringency
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:21.760]   with respect to the quality of ingredients
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:24.000]   and the amount of the ingredients matching
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.440]   what's on the label.
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:27.080]   If you want to see what I take
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:29.880]   and get 20% off any of Thorne's supplements,
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:34.880]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:37.080]   You'll see the list of supplements that I take,
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:38.760]   you can get 20% off those.
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:41.020]   And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:43.500]   you get 20% off anything that Thorne makes.
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:46.260]   I know we covered a lot of information today.
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:49.320]   I hope you learned a lot about time-restricted feeding.
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:52.040]   I hope you learned a lot about metabolism
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:53.860]   and energy and health,
[02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:57.700]   and how when you eat is as important as what you eat.
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.040]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:04.380]   [upbeat music]
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:06.960]   (upbeat music)
