[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Let's talk next about the Hilton Aspire card.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.140]   And this is a great card.
[00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:03.940]   It's one of my favorites.
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.420]   We hold two of them right now.
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.480]   It has a higher annual fee at $550,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.540]   but I think it makes up for it every year.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.780]   You get 14X on Hilton,
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.540]   7X on flights, rental cars, and restaurants,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.960]   and 3X on everything else.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.520]   A huge signup bonus.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.560]   It's never actually been higher of 175,000 points
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.200]   on 6K spend in six months.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900]   You get free Hilton Diamond status,
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000]   which gets you access to executive lounges,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.840]   daily food and beverage, or continental breakfast.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.060]   You get $200 resort credit every six months.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060]   So we're actually timing our stay
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.300]   for the end of June and the beginning of July.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.360]   So we're gonna actually get that $400 credit
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.340]   all in one stay.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.060]   You get an annual free night certificate.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.040]   Then you get another free night certificate
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.480]   at $30,000 spend.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.100]   And then another free night certificate at $60,000 spend.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.820]   Now keep in mind, it's only Hilton Resorts,
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.880]   so it's not every hotel.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.800]   So I love the Hilton Aspire card.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.020]   They're top tier of status.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.460]   So I think the Hilton Aspire card's an S tier card.
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.780]   It's one of my favorite cards.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.440]   I don't think we'll ever not have this card.
