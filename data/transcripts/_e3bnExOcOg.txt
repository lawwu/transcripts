[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.460]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Duncan, it feels like the markets need some rescuing
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.600]   these days. It's pretty bleak right now. Just day after day of drubbing. Speculative investments
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.960]   taken to the woodshed. I'm a glass-to-cephalic kind of guy, so I want to look at some positives
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.440]   of the drawdown before we get into some questions. I think this whole episode just provides a
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.700]   great reminder that getting rich overnight is not easy and it's not normal. It shouldn't
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.560]   be like that, right? You shouldn't be able to put $10,000 into some token created on
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.840]   the internet that's a joke and make more money than people make in a lifetime.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.560]   - But if you had to pick one right now, which would you pick?
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640]   - How many of them are gonna survive? I'm just saying most people can and should build
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.200]   wealth slowly. Get used to it. I think this is a good time to understand where all the
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.080]   cockroaches are. All the charlatans who were pumping stuff and offering awful advice have
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.040]   been unmasked. And if you're still following these people, then I can't really help you.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.340]   But now is the time to update your sources of advice to know where people were leading
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.280]   you astray. Here's one more. I put this out on Twitter yesterday. Despite a global pandemic,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.800]   the highest inflation rate in 40 years, two bear markets. I'm counting this as a bear
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.480]   market. We're 18 and changing it on the S&P. The S&P 500 is still, put this chart up, John,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.140]   up 26% since the start of 2020. All this stuff that's going on. The S&P is still actually
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.400]   up since the start of 2020. All this other stuff. Pandemic, inflation, all this stuff.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.320]   One more. Stocks are getting cheaper. So, the market's up 26%-ish since 2020. Earnings
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.040]   are up 50%. The stock market is on sale. John, flip this next chart from Ed Yardeni. This
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.360]   shows the forward PEs for large cap, small cap, mid cap. And large cap's still elevated
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.720]   a little bit. You can see mid cap now on a valuation basis for forward price-to-earnings
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.680]   ratios are below where we were in the 2018 bear market, fast approaching where we were
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.040]   in the March 2020 levels. Stocks are getting cheaper. So, I don't know. Look, bear markets
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.200]   are never fun to live through, but sometimes you need to shake out the excesses a little
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   bit. The fun times never last forever, but these terrible times don't last forever either.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.160]   So, I don't know. Regarding that chart, the small cap ones being at a lower PE now, is
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.680]   that because they have a greater chance, people think, of going bankrupt or something? What's
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.680]   the deal there?
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.720]   Because earnings are going up. Well, people are scared. The Russell 2000 has given up
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.880]   basically all their gains since the pandemic started. So, I don't know. Markets have survived
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080]   much worse than this. My whole thinking is this too shall pass. We'll get through it.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.440]   Duncan, your slacks the last few days have been keeping me going. You're looking to move
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.200]   your whole portfolio into IBONs.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah. It's rough out there.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.480]   Remember, if you have a question, email us at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Let's do
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.600]   the first one.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.620]   Okay. "Up first, my portfolio has been aligned to a 60/40 allocation, but I'm seriously considering
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.420]   adding more equity exposure to position for a longer-term market rebound. However, doing
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.800]   this would mean selling a portion of my bond allocation at the current woes. Am I overthinking
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   things?"
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.480]   See, this person is trying to be Glass Ethyl as well. Just last week we were talking about,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.360]   is 75/25 potentially the new 60/40? What you're really talking about here is over-rebalancing
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.980]   during a bear market. So, bonds are down as well, but now stocks are down a lot more than
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.960]   bonds are. So, you're trying to figure out, "Should I just overweight the portfolio into
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.720]   stocks?" I think there's some questions you have to ask yourself when you're doing an
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.480]   asset allocation change like this. First of all, have my goals and circumstances changed
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.960]   enough to force me to change my portfolio? Right? A change in expectations doesn't always
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.120]   require a change in strategy. So, doing nothing still is a decision. You can stick with your
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.680]   portfolio that you have as long as you're okay with that. I think you have to figure
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.200]   out whether you're looking at this through the lens of a long-term process or the short-term
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.440]   outcomes that you're overreacting to because the market's moved. And then, I think you
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.040]   have to understand, if I started from scratch today, is this the same portfolio that I would
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.000]   build? So, of course, obviously you always have to take into account your risk profile
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.920]   and time horizon, but I think if you're okay with it, and the tax implications make sense,
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.040]   you could be selling bonds down today a little bit. You're locking in some losses that you
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.840]   can use for taxes, depending on where your assets are located. But, I don't know, if
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.980]   you believe a stock-heavy portfolio is a better fit for your risk profile and time horizon,
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.040]   and you don't mind locking in some gains because you think the risk/reward in stocks is better
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.960]   than bonds right now, I have no problem with that. The asset allocation is not easy, right?
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.920]   The perfect portfolio is only going to be known with hindsight. So, I think if you have
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.480]   a good reason to change, and you're going to stick with it for the long-term, you're
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.800]   not just going to do it, and then if stocks fall more, you're going to abandon the plan
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.440]   and go back to bonds. As long as it's a long-term thing, I think that makes sense.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.640]   Yeah. No, that sounds like good advice. I mean, it's also not, like you've talked about
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.680]   before, the emotions can kind of get in the way in a crash like this, and that doesn't
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320]   always lead to great decision-making.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.600]   Right. Like, if you asked me, "Should I take 100% of my stock picks and move them to iBonds?"
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.040]   I don't know. I might be considering that, too. Let's do the next one.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.960]   Okay. So, yeah, it's funny. We have all this advice, and you give all this great advice,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.880]   and then I look at my Robin Hood, and I'm like, "Why didn't I take all this advice myself?"
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.120]   Okay. So, our second question -- the first one, by the way, was from Scott. This question
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.920]   is from Badri. "I've heard of the 4% rule for retirement withdrawals and even the more
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.680]   conservative 3% rule, but I'm not interested in exhausting my retirement portfolio. Rather,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.480]   I have two objectives. One, withdraw enough annually to live comfortably and within my
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.080]   lifestyle. Two, grow my retirement portfolio so that I can leave a sizable amount to my
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.120]   children. I was planning on 2%, but is there a metric or a rule of thumb for this?"
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.760]   All right. So, William Bengen is a financial advisor who first put this out in a 1994 research
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.000]   paper called "Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data." So, he proposed a
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   safe withdrawal rate of 4% using the portfolio's value in your first year of retire, and then
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.560]   you basically use that as a baseline, and you take the 4% and you increase it by inflation
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.120]   every year. He'll call it 2%, 3%, whatever. I guess now it would be 8%. He uses a 50/50
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.520]   stock bond portfolio, and here's some of the findings from his original paper. An absolute
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.200]   safe withdrawal rate based on historical market returns came out to 3%, given that insured
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.320]   portfolio longevity was never less than 50 years. So, if you're a FIRE person, 3% is
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.040]   probably better than 4%. But, an initial withdrawal rate of 4% was considered safe because it
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.880]   never resulted in a portfolio being exhausted in less than 33 years. The worst case withdrawal
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.720]   for a 4.25% withdrawal rate was 28 years. He also said having too much in stocks is
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.120]   just as bad as having too little. So, he found 50 to 75 was about right. So, that's probably
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.200]   where we get the 60/40 from. And 4% was not the baseline, but worst case. Right? Now,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   of course, he wrote this in 1994. Back then, you could get 7% or 8% in Treasuries. Not
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   quite as easy today with 3%. But, this is not an easy thing. We talk about retirement
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   a lot here. Nobel Prize-winning economist William Sharpe once said that it's the nastiest,
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.320]   hardest problem in retirement. Because, like, there's a lot of Nobels. How long are you
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.120]   going to live? What are your spending habits going to look like years from now? What's
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.480]   healthcare going to cost? You don't know these things. What are the returns going to be for
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.920]   financial markets? And then, what happens if you have a big, unexpected outlay? The
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.800]   other thing is, sequence of return risk is huge. So, John, put up the chart of the S&P
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.200]   here. This is the S&P. I did this for my blog a couple years ago. Two years ago, maybe.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.400]   So, this is the S&P 500. Annual returns from 2000 to 2020. Now, let's say you had a million
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   bucks and you put it all on the S&P. This is not a very realistic example, but just
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.640]   go with me here, because I'm going to talk about sequence of return risk. If you did
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.120]   it at the outset, do your 4% rule, and increased it by 2% for inflation, by 2020, you would
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.200]   have, like, $470,000 left. Now, let's say you reversed it. Instead of going in the order,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   because you can see those first three years, you had three down years in the S&P. Down
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.600]   9%, down 12%, down 22. What if your returns started in 2020 and worked backwards? So,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.440]   it's the same exact returns. The annual return is exactly the same. It's 6.5%. But you just
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.320]   have those returns occur in a different order. If this were the case, starting with that
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.640]   same million-dollar portfolio, now you end up with $2.3 million after 21 years. So, you
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.000]   have this sequence of return risk where you could have the same exact return over time.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.640]   Let's say the market returns 8%. But if you have a nasty bear market that lasts three
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.560]   years at the outset of retirement, and you're depleting your portfolio, that could be hard
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.080]   for you. Of course, that's just luck. It's good or bad, you know, whether you have a
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   bull market or bear market at the outset. So, the answer here is that diversification
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.160]   helps. I used a portfolio with no bonds. And then, most retirement plans are going
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.800]   to require some flexibility, right? Listen, I think 2% is ultra-conservative. If you started
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.600]   it today, that's 50 years' worth of expenses on day one, not including inflation. So, I
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   think you're being very conservative there. One more thing, I think, yes, giving your
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.680]   children a big nest egg when you die is probably, I don't know, kind of a worthy goal. But it's
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.560]   also nice if they see you spend it and enjoy it while you're here. So, watch them enjoy
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.000]   it a little. If you're not going to spend it, I'll watch them enjoy it a little. I think
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.760]   you could talk to them about it, even. Like, "Would you rather receive a bunch of money
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.580]   from me when I die and we have this really long time horizon and let it grow, or take
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.960]   some help now when you're younger and you probably need the money more?" So, it's probably
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.740]   going to be helpful when they're younger, anyway. So, maybe that's a conversation worth
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.920]   having with them as well.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.320]   O'Reilly: Yeah, it's true. Or, yeah, do some traveling as a family. You know, enjoy the
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.520]   money together, as opposed to, like you guys have talked about before, you know, just getting
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.120]   the money after you're dead.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.560]   I think the inheritance thing is an older way of looking at things, I think. I think
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.840]   that's another generation, and I think maybe we need an update on that.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.520]   Do you think, will people be leaving, like, bored apes to their kids and grandkids?
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:26.240]   Michael's son is going to be receiving all his NFTs. Thanks a lot, Dad! Once AI takes
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.920]   over the world and those NFTs are worthless, then, you know, it's not good inheritance.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.480]   All right, let's move on.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.280]   Okay, question three. So, this question is from Sean. "There are a lot of people calling
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.760]   for recessions in the coming months or years. Can this become self-fulfilling? If everyone
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.160]   says a recession is coming and people cut their spending, wouldn't that cause a recession?"
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.740]   I love this question. This is a question I've had before, and it seems like it makes sense
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.740]   to me.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.880]   Lewis: Yeah. This is more of a, instead of a macro data kind of thing, this is a psychological
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.400]   thing. So, let's bring in someone who's been writing about the psychology of markets for
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.740]   longer than I've been around. Barry Rittholtz, our firm's namesake.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.360]   Hey, guys. How's it going?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   Gardner: Hey, Barry.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.620]   Lewis: So, Frederick Lewis Allen, who's one of my favorite financial historians, he once
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.120]   said that, he wrote a book about the 1920s, about the boom that led up to the Great Depression.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.240]   He said, "Prosperity is more than an economic condition. It is a state of mind." And I think
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:22.040]   there's a lot to this. So, what do you think? Let's say the Fed is shifting psychology right
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.320]   now. Can they throw us into a recession just by getting people to change the way they view
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   their own finances?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:33.040]   Gardner: So, the answer is kind of complicated. And I'm going to try and work through the
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:42.160]   nuances. And I don't know if you guys remember, back in 2008, John McCain's economic advisor,
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.280]   Senator Phil Graham, warned that all this negative sentiment was trying to, people jawbone
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   their way into a recession. It turned out, what caused the recession was just a collapse
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.320]   in the world's finances, between housing and derivatives and everything else. So, I'm really
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.960]   kind of reluctant to embrace we can talk ourselves into a recession. Stop and think about what
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.640]   you spend money on each day. You get the kids ready for school, you pay your mortgage, you
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:20.680]   pay your iPhone bill, you got to shop for this, that. That's 80% of the economy right
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:27.600]   there. So, are people really going to cut back on their discretionary spending so much?
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.720]   Are you not sending the kids to soccer or karate? Are you not taking them out occasionally
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.760]   for pizza or McDonald's or whatever your portion of choice is?
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.160]   Lewis: That is a good point. I was talking to Michael this week on our podcast, and I
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.560]   said, "I was out to dinner last week for my wife's birthday, and none of these people
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.720]   in the restaurant care that the stock market is in a bear market. They're not paying attention
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.640]   to that. They're out there enjoying their lives, they're spending, they're going to
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.160]   concerts." So, I do think that probably us in the finance world probably think this is
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.600]   more of a thing than anyone outside of it. We're probably not paying as much attention
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   as we are anyway.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.640]   Muckerman: Right. And the other aspect of this is it's the problem with all of these
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.760]   sentiment surveys. When you ask people things like, "How do you feel about the state of
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.000]   the economy? How much money are you going to spend for holiday shopping?" Anytime you
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.480]   ask them, what you're really asking them is, "Tell us about your future behavior." And
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   it turns out we're terrible as a species at predicting what we're going to do off in
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:28.160]   the future. You can give a momentary emotional thought, "Well, I'm nervous. My stocks
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.560]   are down. My bonds are down. My NFTs and cryptos are down. I'm probably going to throttle
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.720]   back." And then people go out and spend and spend anyway. The countryside is littered
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.040]   with the bodies of economists forecasting the demise of the American consumer. That's
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   a terrible bet to make.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.280]   Lewis: Do you think that this wealth effect thing -- to me, when my stock portfolio is
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   up or down, that's long-term capital for me, so that doesn't really determine how I spend
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.000]   money now, because that's future me, right? So that's the same thing. The Fed seems really
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.800]   worried about this wealth effect, that they want to bring it down to bring down inflation.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.280]   Do you think that can really do something?
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.800]   Muckerman: I think the Fed has gotten the wealth effect completely backwards. I wrote
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.080]   a column about this, I don't know, a decade ago. The same things that caused the economy
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.200]   to go up caused the stock market to go up. And the Fed has it backwards. The Fed seems
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.720]   to think, "Hey, if the stock market is rising, people are going to go out and spend more.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.480]   That's the wealth effect." When you look at the vast majority of the public has such a
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.880]   tiny investment portfolio -- you had a piece not too long ago about the top 1% have something
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.400]   like 20-30% of stocks, and the top 10% has, I think, substantially more than half -- that
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:52.600]   means 90% of the public, their portfolios, it's noise, it's on TV or in the newspapers,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.040]   but it's not affecting their day-to-day life, it doesn't make a difference in their spending,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.080]   it doesn't make a difference in a whole lot of, really, anything for most of the consuming
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.560]   public. So, I think the Fed has the wealth effect exactly backwards. Good economy means
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.200]   good spending and good stock market, not the other way around.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.480]   Yeah, I agree. Let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:24.400]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Mark. And Mark's question is, "Lately, we've been
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.280]   hearing the terms 'soft landing' and 'hard landing' regarding the Fed's actions. Can
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.760]   you explain what these two phrases mean in market terms, and what are the implications?"
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.240]   I think everyone would prefer a soft landing right now, I guess. I put a little meat on
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.120]   the bones here. So, I'm going to call soft landing, "We don't go into recession, inflation
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.840]   comes under control." Hard landing, "Recession is required to bring everything under control."
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:55.240]   That's kind of been what's happening lately. So, I looked. There have been, since 1928,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.400]   14 bear markets in or around a recession. The average drawdown for those 14 bear markets
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   was almost 40% in the last 390 days, peak to trough, on average.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.480]   If we go non-recessionary bears, which has happened more than you think, you know, 1987,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.600]   1990 was close to one. There's been a couple times in the '40s around the war. I think
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.120]   there's been like 10 non-recessionary bears. So, fall close to 20% or more, but you don't
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.760]   go into recession. The average for those is 26% on average, and lasting 202 days. So,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.960]   a nasty correction or bear market that happens if we don't get a recession. I think for the
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.920]   stock market, that's probably a positive. It probably doesn't get worse. We have a recession,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.680]   that makes it worse. Barry, what do you think?
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.840]   So, I've been flying Southwest since the airline started, and I have a vivid recollection.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.680]   If you've ever flown into LaGuardia, it's kind of a short runway, and you're over water
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.400]   until you just land.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.600]   And looks like you're going to land on the water.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:57.360]   Right, right. I have a vivid recollection of a plane. It felt like it slammed into the
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.800]   runway, and I just remember the stewardess say, "Welcome to New York's LaGuardia Airport.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:12.160]   Please stay seated until the pilot taxis what's left of the aircraft to the gate." And really,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.880]   that just sticks in my mind as, it wasn't a soft landing, and it wasn't a crash, it
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.400]   was a hard landing. And it's a great metaphor to, we don't, I agree with you Ben, it's not
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.680]   a recession, the Fed doesn't tighten so much that the economy begins to contract extensively
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.120]   across all sectors, but things slow down enough, maybe we have flat or slightly negative growth
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.160]   for a couple of months or a quarter or longer, but it gets inflation under control, and then
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.660]   we could resume the rest of the cycle. I think you got it exactly right.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.480]   Do you think the Fed can actually thread that needle though?
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:57.880]   So you know, I've been wrong about inflation. I've thought it would be transitory, right?
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:05.400]   And transitory has proven to be far more transitory and taking much longer than expected. So when
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.160]   you look at, here's the challenge the Fed is facing. When you look at all the inputs
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:16.960]   into inflation, almost none of them are caused by low rates or QE. The war in Ukraine obviously
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.400]   made anything associated with energy and a lot of things associated with food worse.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.380]   Semiconductor constraints are affecting the car market. There's been a shortage of home
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:33.480]   building going back to the entire decade post-financial crisis. The Fed raising rates isn't going
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.800]   to do a whole lot of that. And when you look at the number of home sales that are all cash,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.640]   mortgage rates don't matter. So I kind of think Jerome Powell is in the transitory camp
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:52.880]   and they expect, believe, hope, or rooting for a lot of interest rates. I'm sorry, a
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:00.200]   lot of inflation rates coming down on their own as things progress. And I hope they're
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.680]   right. They don't have to get a lot right for a soft landing to occur, but they're concerned
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:14.320]   that a few things go wrong and you can have a pretty hard landing and not have a bad recession.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.920]   But you know, a lot of these things are outside of their control. I just saw a piece today,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.680]   maybe it was Charles Bolello, tweeted it, that showed inflation rates around the world.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:31.360]   And it's not just the US. I don't know what the Fed can do to affect inflation in anywhere
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.600]   from Poland to China to, you know, to South America. It's out of their control and has
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   been for a long time.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.520]   Right. They can't make the ships bring stuff over faster with supply chains. They can't
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.580]   put cars on the dealership lots, any of that stuff. Maybe they can, I guess they're trying
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.000]   to hope that they can slow demand, but that other supply stuff is out of their hands.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.040]   Right. And by the way, those giant container ships, they take three years to build and
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.800]   they cost hundreds of millions of dollars. And nobody wants to build more because the
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:06.640]   expectation is, hey, once the reopening process kind of works itself out, and we return to
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:14.200]   a service economy, remember, pre-pandemic, we were about 61% services, 39% goods.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.880]   That kind of flipped when you couldn't go out to restaurants, couldn't go to the gym,
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.680]   couldn't go on vacation. You bought stuff to do everything at home. That'll eventually
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:28.560]   reverse itself. It's sort of doing it already. If you look at what's going on with stocks
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.920]   like Peloton and you look at the airlines, how booked they are for the next couple of
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:40.000]   quarters, the return to services seems to be taking place. That'll be a big driver of
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.920]   reducing inflation also.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.040]   Yep. All right. Duncan, we got one more question.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.800]   Okay. Ben, when you find out from your Fed colleagues if this is going to be a soft or
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.400]   hard landing, can you let us know?
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.080]   Somewhere in the middle, Duncan, is what I'm hoping for.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   Okay.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.920]   I dissented from the last vote, so.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:02.480]   Also, we had a question in the chat. What do you mean when you say retail investor?
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.520]   I think the non-pros and non-institutions probably, right? A lot of institutions control
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.920]   a lot of the capital. Retail is more your individual 401(k) brokerage investor.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   Okay.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   Household.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.560]   Portfolios, not professionals.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.680]   Yeah, not a professional portfolio manager, that kind of thing.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.720]   That makes sense. All right. Up next, we have a question from Kim. There are a lot of new
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   investors out there who might not have experienced a prolonged bear market like we're seeing
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.540]   right now. What advice would you give those young investors?
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:37.160]   My thing with this is always for young people that your biggest asset when you're young
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.400]   is not money, because you probably don't have a lot of it. Your biggest asset is time and
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.760]   therefore human capital. So, how much you save is going to have a way bigger impact
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.940]   than your investment returns. So, as long as you keep saving and then increase that
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.160]   savings rate a little bit each year, that's the only thing that matters. And bear markets
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:01.320]   are good for a young person. When I first started saving real money back in 2007, I
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.400]   got my second job and I finally had a 401(k) for the first time. And all it did was go
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.640]   down for a year and a half. Those purchases are the best purchases I'll ever make in my
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.040]   career, right? I was buying throughout 2008 when it was falling. So, I think you just
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.800]   have to get used to it. I talked about it. So, there's been 15 bear markets since 1950.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.480]   The average loss is 30%. I think all-time highs, while they make you feel good, they're
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.840]   your enemy if you're a young person. If you have decades and decades ahead of you, you
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.480]   just have to expect these. And you're probably going to have, I don't know, 7 to 10 of them
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.840]   throughout your career if you're investing for 40 or 50 years. So, part of it is just
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.560]   like get used to it, one. And two, keep saving because your savings rate matters way more
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.160]   than your investment return right now.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.800]   Really, couldn't possibly agree more. The one thing I have to raise, I have to raise
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.120]   a couple of questions. The first is, what is this word prolonged in the question? This
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:22:00.520]   is going on six months. '08-'09 was notorious as a short bear market, and it was 18 months.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.760]   If you're a market historian and you look back at what things have been like, in 1966,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:13.640]   we had just come off 20 years of amazing gains following the end of World War II. And the
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:20.320]   markets hit a peak, the Dow just kind of kissed 1,000, and it literally spent the next 16
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.360]   years sort of chopping up and down and unable to get over those 1966 highs. It wasn't until
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:35.280]   1982, 16 years later, that all the major indices got above that 66 high. So, if you're not
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:42.980]   happy with six months, imagine being a buyer during those 16 years. You're seeing no gains,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:48.960]   and that's before you get to inflation, which was not only much, much higher than today,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.800]   but persistent. It wasn't like a spike. And we're already, you know, if I had a guess,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:59.840]   we're probably past peak inflation. I mentioned this on our quarterly call earlier this month.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.160]   But think about 16 years. Now, if you're in your 20s and 30s and you're contributing to
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:13.240]   a 401(k) regularly for 16 years, it's going to feel terrible for those 16 years. And then
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.020]   suddenly the market's going to explode upwards and everything you own is going to be worth
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.640]   2 and 3x what you paid for it.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:25.760]   So, perfect example of this. So, 2000 to 2009 was a lost decade in the S&P. I had a friend
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.720]   who told me that was much older than me when I first started working. "I've been saving
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.180]   my 401(k) for 10 years. I now have less money in market value than I put in." And they thought
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.200]   this was a bad thing. And then you have the explosion for the next 10 or 12 years of a
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.620]   bull market, but you just had 10 years to put in money at lower prices and higher dividend
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.520]   yields and lower valuations. Now, that 10 years of saving at lower prices all make sense
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.440]   because you get this explosion higher once things do get better. So, yeah, you want that
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.800]   choppiness and volatility and lower prices occasionally because that's a good thing for
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   you long term.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:03.700]   Right. The way I like to explain this is the tail end of a bull market, right, and the
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:10.420]   era you're talking about, think about '96, 1996 when Alan Greenspan gave his irrational
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:16.260]   exuberant speech to 2000. Not only did the market have this spectacular gain, what it
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:22.460]   effectively did was pull all these gains forward from the next decade or so. And the highs
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:31.220]   hit in 2000 were not surpassed until 2013. So very parallel to '66 to '82, you have 13
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:38.420]   years of up and down and up and down. In fact, the '08, '09 crisis, I think the market fell,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:47.900]   was it 57%, which was identical to '73, '74, the market fell 56, 57%. And so, you have
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:53.260]   13 years of it just feels awful. It goes up, it goes down, it goes up, it goes down, and
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:59.340]   your portfolio value is the same. And then look at what happened from, you know, 2013
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.960]   or the bottom in '09 forward. If you were making those contributions regularly over
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:12.660]   that long bear market, you know, the Nasdaq bottomed at around $1,100. The S&P 500 bottomed
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:20.920]   at $666. Even today, below $4,000, you're still 5X where you were. It's an incredible.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.420]   So when you're investing during a bear market, you have to think, "I'm investing for the
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.140]   next cycle, not this cycle." And that's hard to do.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.780]   Yeah. The other thing I think that really helps as a young person, automate everything.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.620]   So automate your saving, automate your investing, and go have drinks with a friend. Go for a
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.620]   walk, go to the gym. Don't spend all your time paying attention to the market because
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.820]   for you right now, especially if you're saving for retirement, it doesn't really matter that
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.500]   much. So just take it out of your hands, take the emotions away, and go try to live your
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.780]   life if you can. You don't have to spend as much time as we do paying attention to stuff.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.020]   Let us care about it and you care about something else.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.500]   Something I've tried to do on that note that you were just describing, I've been trying
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:05.180]   to look more at how many shares I have in my IRA instead of the amount. You know, that
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.180]   way it's less depressing.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.880]   If you're dollar cost averaging, you're buying more shares at a lower price. Then when markets
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.380]   are up, you buy fewer shares at a higher price. That's the way dollar cost averaging works.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.340]   Psychologically, it feels better to see the share count going up, even if the price is
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.340]   going down.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.380]   Yeah. Also, we'll give a plug for Masters in Business. Barry just had Michael Lewis
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.300]   on a couple of weeks ago talking about people wanting to get into the finance world, if
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   you haven't listened to that.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.300]   Great show.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.420]   Really good. Anyone coming up, Barry, on Masters in Business?
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:34.580]   Boaz Weinstein is this really fascinating investor and trader. They do derivatives,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.940]   well risk, Saba Capital is the name of the firm. He kind of became famous because do
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:46.160]   you remember the London whale that lost JPMorgan Chase like $6 billion? Boaz was on the other
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.740]   side of the trade. He didn't make $6 billion, but the Saba Capital made hundreds of millions
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:58.080]   of dollars. And the ironic thing is that he gave a speech at a JPMorgan Chase conference
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.420]   like a year beforehand, warning about concentrated risk in commodity trading and how to hedge
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:09.820]   tail risk. He literally said, "You guys are about to get screwed, and I'm going to be
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.940]   on the other side of the trade, and here's how I'm going to do it." And pretty much that's
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.940]   what happened.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.940]   Nice.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.940]   That'll be this weekend.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.700]   Great. Okay. Remember, if you're watching on YouTube or my blog or something, you can
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.420]   listen to us in podcast form as well. Leave us a review so other people can find it. Keep
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.660]   those questions and comments coming. We've been getting a lot of really good questions
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.380]   lately. Too many, right, Duncan?
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.140]   Yeah. We've seen a huge uptick in great questions with the market volatility.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.940]   Yeah. Keep them coming. Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Remember, we're going to get through this,
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.820]   I promise. But stop paying attention so much to the market every day. Go for a walk. Go
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.140]   get a drink with friends. Have some fun. And we'll see you next time.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.140]   Thanks, everyone. Thanks, Barry.
