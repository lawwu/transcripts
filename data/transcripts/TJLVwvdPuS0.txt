[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   Well, the reason we capitalized "Light of the World" on some references and not in others
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.880]   has to do with a little thing called the article.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.440]   When Jesus says, "I am the light of the world," he's giving a title to himself and that's
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.760]   capitalized.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.400]   In the other reference, however, the article is not in the original language and it's more
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.000]   like he's the light for the world.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.200]   He's not the light of the world.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.080]   He's serving as a light to the world.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.240]   First time, the article is there in the Greek.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.400]   The second time, the article is not there.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.240]   So "I am the light of the world," capitalized.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.660]   "I am serving as a light to the world," not capitalized.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.040]   So it has to do with what's in the original language.
