[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - Well, happy Friday and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.920]   I hope your Thanksgiving was full.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.100]   I hope it was wonderful.
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.500]   And we end this holiday week on the podcast
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.780]   with an email from a young man named Peyton.
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780]   Peyton writes this, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.020]   "Thank you for your look at the book video series.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.900]   "I used them to prepare a recent lesson I taught
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.640]   "on 1 Peter 3, verses 8 to 22.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.320]   "Later on, I found your exegesis of 1 Peter 4, 15
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.840]   "very helpful to understand the role of suffering
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660]   "in the Christian life.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.960]   "One of your four conclusions was this,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   "don't prioritize the value of suffering
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.380]   "above the value of doing good.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.060]   "I think that's a relevant word in this age
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.120]   "when getting hated or deleted online
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.020]   "is a badge of accomplishment.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.400]   "You draw out a powerful application
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.760]   "from this text as for why,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.400]   "but I'm failing to connect this point of application
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.720]   "to the text itself.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.000]   "Can you elaborate on what you mean by this connection
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.800]   "and how Peter is conveying this message to his readers?
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.400]   "Also, how might we apply this in our daily walk
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.760]   "as we battle against unjust suffering?
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.400]   "Thank you."
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.600]   - Okay, let's get everybody up to speed.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   Here's the context of 1 Peter 4, 13 to 16.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.100]   Rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.680]   that you may rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.120]   If you are insulted for the name of Christ,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   you're blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.060]   and of God rests upon you.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.060]   But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.520]   or an evildoer or as a meddler.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.960]   Yet, if anyone suffers as a Christian,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.000]   let him not be ashamed,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.040]   but let him glorify God in that name.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.120]   What arrested my attention in that text
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.720]   that Peyton is referring to
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.520]   is how obvious it is that we ought not to suffer
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or a meddler.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.000]   In fact, it seems so obvious that you wonder
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.760]   why did Peter feel the need to write,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.280]   "Let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.600]   "or an evildoer or a meddler."
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.240]   He certainly did not mean it's okay if you murder
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.040]   and steal and do evil and meddle,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.920]   just don't get caught and suffer for it.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.320]   That's not what he meant.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.280]   So why, why did Peter say that?
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.720]   Why didn't he just say, "Don't murder, don't steal,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.960]   "don't do evil, don't meddle,"
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.840]   instead of saying, "Don't suffer for it."
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   Well, evidently, because Peter's teaching
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.180]   on the necessity of suffering in this book
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.240]   and the value of suffering in this book,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.080]   especially in chapter one, where it functions like fire
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.000]   to burn away the dross out of the gold of our faith,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.400]   evidently, some people were saying
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.720]   that any suffering is good,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.800]   even if it's suffering for doing bad things,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.360]   it's good for you.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   Now, there are two other texts in 1 Peter
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.120]   that make me think that, that confirm I'm on the right track
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.640]   when I guess that might be what's going on here.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   For example, in 1 Peter 2, 19, he says,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.720]   "This is a gracious thing when mindful of God,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.680]   "one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   "For what credit is it if when you sin
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.400]   "and are beaten for it, you endure?"
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.040]   Now, why would Peter have to say that?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.080]   What credit is it if when you sin
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.900]   and are beaten for it, you endure?
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.480]   It sounds like somebody is saying,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.520]   "There's some credit in that.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.660]   "There's some credit in suffering,
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.760]   "even if you got beaten because you sinned."
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.560]   And Peter's saying, "What?
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.160]   "There's no credit in that."
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.440]   Or here's another text pointing in the same direction.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   1 Peter 3, 17 says, "It is better to suffer for doing good,"
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.580]   if that should be God's will, "than for doing evil."
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.020]   Well, how obvious is that?
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.780]   Well, maybe not so obvious.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.420]   If somebody hears Peter saying,
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.420]   "It's better to be on the receiving end of injustice
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.760]   "than to be on the giving end of injustice,"
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.040]   which is in fact what he's saying,
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   that might be a little hard for people to swallow.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.760]   So I circled back to 1 Peter 4, 15
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.920]   when I was working on that look at the book session
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.480]   where it says, "Let none of you suffer as a murderer
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.120]   "or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler."
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.280]   And I circled back and drew out four lessons
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.580]   that Peyton is zeroing in on here.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.860]   Here's the first one.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.780]   "It is not a matter of indifference
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.040]   "whether you suffer for doing good
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.560]   "or suffer for doing evil."
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.020]   Anyone who says that suffering for evil
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.240]   does as much good for you as suffering for good
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.140]   is not paying attention to the apostles' teaching.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.800]   That was my first lesson.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.200]   Second lesson I drew out was,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.780]   "There's no credit, no honor
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.820]   "that comes from suffering for sin."
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.440]   Third lesson I drew out,
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.260]   "Injustice against you is better
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.880]   "than your doing the injustice."
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.020]   And the fourth one, and this is the one he was asking about,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.420]   don't prioritize the value of suffering
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.480]   above the value of doing good.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.900]   It's that one that Peyton is asking about when he says,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.600]   "Can you elaborate on what you mean by this conclusion
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.980]   "and how Peter is conveying this message to his readers?"
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.520]   Well, the way Peter is conveying that thought,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.380]   don't prioritize the value of suffering
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.200]   above the value of doing good,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.920]   the way he conveys that is that the imperatives
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.360]   running right through this entire letter
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.280]   are do good, love, be holy.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   115, 122, 215, 36, 311, et cetera.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.820]   That's what we are to pursue.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.600]   Do good, love, be holy, not suffering.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.000]   Suffering is not to be sought.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.440]   Doing good is to be sought.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.920]   Suffering will come, but it's not the goal.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.440]   Love is the goal.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.860]   Suffering is the price of love,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.280]   but it's not the aim of loving.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.500]   So don't go looking for trouble.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.080]   Don't seek to suffer.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.240]   Don't seek to be persecuted.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.800]   Seek to love at any cost,
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.160]   including persecution or suffering.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   And then Peyton's last question is,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.120]   "How might we apply this in our daily walk
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.240]   "as we battle unjust suffering?"
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.320]   Well, the way it applies to battling
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.080]   against unjust suffering,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   indeed against natural suffering like disease, calamity,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.540]   is that it directs our attention outward to others,
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.620]   not inward to ourselves.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.480]   If we said, "Seek suffering for righteousness' sake,"
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.920]   the focus would be on the pain we experience,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.200]   not the blessing others experience.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   The focus would be on our heroic ability to endure suffering,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.020]   not the lowly path of serving others.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.520]   There's a huge difference
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.360]   between the crusade to attract criticism
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.200]   and the crusade to do as much good as you can
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   and leave the persecution to God.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.640]   Leave it to be what he makes of it.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.960]   So Peter says in 310, 1 Peter 310,
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.520]   "Whoever desires to love life and see good days,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.700]   "let him keep his tongue from evil,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.400]   "and his lips from speaking deceit.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   "Let him turn away from evil and do good.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.840]   "Let him seek peace and pursue it."
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.480]   So do good, pursue peace,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.120]   and then he follows that with these words.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.320]   "Now who's there to harm you
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.920]   "if you're zealous for what is good?
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   "But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.660]   "you'll be blessed.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.320]   "Have no fear of them, nor be troubled."
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.080]   In other words, do good
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.280]   and hope for a good reception for your good.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.900]   But if suffering comes, you're blessed.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.120]   There's a great difference between this approach,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.100]   there's a great difference between this approach to life
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:48.100]   than if you were to say that suffering is the main thing
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.120]   and so let's seek it.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.560]   No, love is the main thing, so let's do it.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.360]   - Yeah, that's a good word, balancing.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.440]   And thanks for the question, Peyton,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.340]   and thank you for spending this holiday week with us.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.600]   You can ask a question of your own,

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.080]   Well, what role do young Christians play
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.120]   in leading and guiding a local church,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.040]   especially in light of young Christians
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.920]   being deferential to older Christians,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.280]   according to 1 Peter 5:5?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.160]   How does that work itself out in practice?
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.940]   Call Ask Pastor John.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.140]   We'll see you on Monday.
