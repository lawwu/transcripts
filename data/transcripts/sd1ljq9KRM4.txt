[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.160]   Well, given the church calendar,
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.720]   it may seem premature to talk about Easter today,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.840]   but since this is a weekday podcast
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.520]   and because there is so much to say about Easter,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.540]   we're closing out the week with two episodes
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.400]   on the implication of Christ's resurrection.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.200]   And today we welcome Matthew Harmon to the podcast.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.500]   Dr. Harmon serves as professor of New Testament studies
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.400]   at Grace College and Theological Seminary,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.840]   and he is the co-author of a really good new book
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.360]   along with Benjamin Glad.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.080]   It's titled "Making All Things New,
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.840]   "Inaugurated Eschatology for the Life of the Church."
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.580]   And today I wanna talk about Easter.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.600]   Dr. Harmon, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.760]   - Well, thanks for having me, Tony.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.720]   I really appreciate it.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.640]   - Well, certainly.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.280]   Of course, Easter is a few days away,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.520]   and you claim that the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.500]   changes everything.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.480]   Explain this.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.480]   Why is such a bold statement like that no exaggeration?
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720]   - Well, at first it can seem like to claim
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.840]   that the resurrection changes everything
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   is an example of hype,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.280]   but as you read the Bible and you understand
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.480]   all that flows out of Jesus' resurrection,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.480]   it is no exaggeration to say that Jesus rising from the dead
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.780]   literally changes everything.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.240]   And we could talk for days about the implications
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.960]   and things that come out of that,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.240]   but in the short time I have today,
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.440]   I wanna focus on 10 things
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.420]   that Jesus' resurrection tells us about him,
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.680]   what it did for us,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.320]   and what it did for creation itself.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320]   So first, Jesus' resurrection embodies the new creation
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.600]   and launches God's end-time kingdom
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960]   into this present world.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.520]   So when Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.080]   it was the beginning of a new era in human history.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.720]   Ever since Adam and Eve had rebelled against God,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.460]   the world has been under the curse,
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.880]   but throughout the Old Testament,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.640]   God had promised to redeem his people
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   and transform creation itself through a descendant of Eve.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.920]   And in Ezekiel 37,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.560]   God describes that redemption of his people
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.720]   as an act of resurrection,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680]   God putting flesh and skin on dry bones,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.760]   raising people from their graves
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.240]   and breathing his spirit into them.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.680]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   God's new creation kingdom has broken into this fallen world.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   Second, Jesus' resurrection identifies him
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   as the promised Davidic king who rules over creation.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   In Isaiah 11, one through nine,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.720]   God had promised to raise up a king from David's line
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.120]   who would be anointed with God's spirit.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.320]   And he would rule in righteousness.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.200]   And as a result of his rule,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.560]   creation would be set right
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.040]   the way it was supposed to be originally.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.960]   So in his sermon on the day of Pentecost at Acts 2,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.640]   Peter tells us that when Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   it proved that he was this promised descendant of David,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.520]   the promised king who would come
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.580]   and be the one who rules over creation.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.760]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.160]   he proved that he was the anointed,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.720]   spirit anointed king from David's line,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.200]   establishing his rule over all creation.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.720]   Third, Jesus' resurrection identifies him
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.960]   as the end time judge of the world.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.200]   So in that same passage in Isaiah 11,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.840]   this Davidic king is said to rule over creation
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.600]   with perfect justice.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.240]   He wouldn't be swayed by people's appearances
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.160]   or their wealth or their socioeconomic status,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.760]   but he would execute perfect justice.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.600]   So when Paul appears before the men of Athens
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.880]   on Mars Hill in Acts 17,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.320]   he says that God has fixed a day to judge the world.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.000]   And the proof that he's going to judge the world
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.640]   is that he has raised the judge, Jesus Christ,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.600]   from the dead.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.220]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.160]   it establishes him as the one
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.360]   who will judge all creation at the end of time.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.180]   Fourth, Jesus' resurrection identifies him
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.200]   as the last Adam.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.760]   So in 1 Corinthians 15, 21 and 22,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.880]   Paul writes, "For as by a man came death,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.740]   by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.960]   For as in Adam all die,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.440]   so also in Christ shall all be made alive."
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   When Adam sinned, death entered the world.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.760]   When Jesus Christ, the last Adam, rose from the dead,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.120]   new creation life began to flow into this world.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.360]   That's because Jesus obeyed where Adam had failed.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.000]   So death had no rightful claim over Jesus as the last Adam.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.960]   Fifth, Jesus' resurrection accomplishes our spiritual birth
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.560]   and spiritual resurrection from the dead.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.040]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 45,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.960]   Paul says that through his resurrection,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.400]   Jesus became a life-giving spirit.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.020]   Now this is a really difficult verse to understand,
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.200]   but at least part of what Paul means
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.160]   is that the risen Jesus is the one
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.520]   who gives spiritual life to his people.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.000]   And in Ephesians 2, 4 through 6,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.280]   Paul makes a similar point when he says
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.000]   that God made us alive together with Christ,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.700]   raised us up with him,
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.400]   and seated us with him in the heavenly places.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.000]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.360]   he raises us from our spiritual death into spiritual life.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   Sixth, Jesus' resurrection accomplishes our justification.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.280]   So at the heart of saving faith in Jesus
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.840]   is believing that God raised him from the dead.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   And when God raised Jesus from the dead,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.240]   he was vindicating Jesus.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.960]   He was demonstrating to the world
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.920]   that he was innocent of the charges against him
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.800]   and that death had no rightful hold on him.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.520]   Romans 4, 25 tells us that Jesus was delivered up
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.320]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.460]   we who are joined to him by faith are justified.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.080]   We are declared not guilty in God's court of law.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.040]   Seventh, Jesus' resurrection enables him
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.320]   to give the Holy Spirit to his people.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.200]   John 7, 39 says that the Spirit could not be given
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.920]   until Jesus was glorified.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.320]   Now by glorified, John means Jesus' death
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.360]   and his resurrection.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.620]   So on the day of Pentecost, in his Sermon to the Crowds,
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.120]   Peter says in Acts 2, 32 and 33,
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.600]   that because God raised Jesus from the dead
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.240]   and exalted him to the right hand of the Father,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.640]   he is able to pour out the Holy Spirit on his people.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.440]   he is able to give us his Holy Spirit to live inside of us.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.920]   Eighth, Jesus' resurrection frees us from our slavery
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.800]   to sin, death, and the devil.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.160]   And this is really where some of the most practical
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.920]   applications of Jesus' resurrection come to the front.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.740]   Romans 6, 1 through 11 talks about how everyone
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.960]   who is joined to Jesus Christ by faith has died,
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.120]   has been buried, and raised with Christ.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.120]   And since that is true, we are no longer slaves of sin,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.500]   but instead, we are slaves of righteousness,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.800]   given the power by the Spirit of God to obey him
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.200]   and to be his instruments of righteousness.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.480]   And then Romans 8, 10 through 17 goes on to talk about
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.380]   how the Spirit of the one who raised Christ from the dead
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.380]   lives in us to empower us to put sin to death.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.900]   And Hebrews 2, 14 and 15 talks about the fact
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.300]   that Jesus has delivered us from the devil
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.180]   and from the fear of death.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.740]   So because Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.840]   we have this remarkable promise
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.140]   that the Spirit of God lives in us and empowers us
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.000]   to be free from our slavery to sin
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.340]   and to death and the devil.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.240]   That's just unbelievable in terms
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.080]   of its practical application.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.280]   Ninth, Jesus' resurrection ensures us
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.260]   that we too will one day have resurrection bodies.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.200]   Now, what those resurrection bodies are like
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.840]   is something of a mystery.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.320]   In 1 Corinthians 15, it tells us that there will be
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.720]   some continuity and some discontinuity
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.000]   between our current bodies and those resurrection bodies.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.740]   But Philippians 3, 20 and 21 tells us
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.860]   that when Christ returns, he will transform our bodies
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.220]   to match his glorious resurrection body.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.140]   And that is a remarkable promise as well.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.220]   Living in a fallen world where our bodies decay,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.140]   are subject to sickness and to aging,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.460]   that there's coming a day when because of Jesus' resurrection
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.780]   our bodies will be transformed
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.180]   to match his perfect, glorious resurrection body.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.160]   And 10th, Jesus' resurrection guarantees
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.800]   that God will one day transform all of creation.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.720]   So 1 Corinthians 15, 20 through 28 presents
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   Jesus' resurrection as the beginning
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.960]   of God transforming the entire universe.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.120]   We experience that new creation
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   the moment we are born again by God's Spirit.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.120]   And Romans 8, 18 through 25 tells us
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.000]   that creation is groaning right now
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.680]   under the weight of the curse,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.320]   waiting for the day when God will completely transform
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   all of creation so that the entire universe
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.580]   will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.680]   as the waters cover the sea.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.720]   And when that day comes, Revelation 21, 3 and 4 tells us
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.320]   that we will draw face to face with God himself.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.240]   Every stain of the fall and the curse
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.860]   will be gone from creation.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.360]   Every tear wiped away, no more death,
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.840]   no more sorrow, no more weeping.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.560]   All of it is done away with.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.000]   And all of that stems ultimately from the fact
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.880]   that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.720]   - That is glorious.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.080]   - So those are just a few of the reasons
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.180]   why Jesus' resurrection is so important.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.760]   It literally changed everything.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.480]   And that's not only why we celebrate Easter,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.600]   but it's why we gather every Sunday morning
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.160]   because every Sunday morning is Resurrection Sunday.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.840]   And to think how amazing is it that we can experience
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.200]   the power of Christ's resurrection in our daily lives
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.080]   because of God's spirit living inside of us.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.200]   And what hope that gives us,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.920]   no matter what we face in this fallen world,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.460]   we can endure because the risen one, Jesus Christ,
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.400]   lives inside of us to empower us
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.960]   to remain faithful to him to the end.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.820]   And that is just scratching the surface
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.280]   of all that Jesus' resurrection has done
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.880]   for creation and done for us.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.960]   - Amen, that is a brief survey,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.440]   but a feast in and of itself.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.760]   Dr. Harmon, thank you for helping us
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.880]   to appreciate the scope of the resurrection.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.920]   - It's my pleasure, thanks for having me.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.880]   - Well, Easter changes everything.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.360]   That is not hyperbole.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.680]   And one thing that fascinates me about Easter
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.880]   is that the resurrection is not something
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.000]   that happens in the New Testament by surprise.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.200]   In fact, if you study the Old Testament carefully,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.020]   you'll see all sorts of illusions that are there,
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.880]   all pointing us towards Christ's
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.240]   eventual defeat over the grave.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.800]   And tomorrow we welcome Dr. Don Carson back to the podcast
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.960]   to give us a whole Bible theology of resurrection.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.180]   You will not wanna miss this episode
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.920]   as Easter comes upon us.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.680]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.780]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.940]   (upbeat music)
