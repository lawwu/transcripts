[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   When I started my career in 1998, 1999, for maybe the first decade, I
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.080]   was trying to be productive.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.920]   I was trying to make the most efficient use of every minute and answer all my
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.580]   emails and do every to-do list.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.840]   And I reached this moment where I realized, Oh my God, if I keep doing that, if I keep
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.080]   sort of spinning that hamster wheel, I'm not going to be as effective as I can.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.480]   If I can clear time, like a week at a time and focus on the most important
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.040]   project, radically better things happen.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.240]   There might be an opportunity that I see that's of much greater value where
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.920]   I can create much better results.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.860]   These focused bursts of work, like John said, where you're focusing on the same
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.800]   thing for hour after hour after hour, and then even day after day after day, the
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.040]   depth that my focus could get into was way, way higher.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.040]   It was like the way I've been thinking about productivity and efficiency is all wrong.
