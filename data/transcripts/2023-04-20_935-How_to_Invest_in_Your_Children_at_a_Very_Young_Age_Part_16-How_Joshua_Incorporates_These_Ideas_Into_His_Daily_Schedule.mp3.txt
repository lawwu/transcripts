[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200]   My name is Josh Rasheeds. I am your host.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   And today I'm going to share with you the penultimate episode of my series
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   on how to invest in children at a very young age.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.000]   And in this particular episode, I want to walk you through a day in my family
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.600]   and how I myself seek to apply the basic principles and tactics and techniques
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600]   that I have discussed with you in this particular series.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.800]   And so that's the plan.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.000]   And by the way, I intend to do my very best to go through this day in exacting detail.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600]   So expect this to be very detailed.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   I'm going to share with you what I do and why I do it
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   and connect basically a day, a day in my life, with what I have talked about.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   A couple of disclaimers as we begin.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.200]   Number one, these are my best ideas on what I'm currently trying to do,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   but recognize that we all as parents, we need to respond to what's working and what's not working.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   And we need to change and adjust our strategy accordingly.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   Next, when I present this day to you, I am engaging in some level of idealization.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Anybody who says, "Hey, here's a normal day in my life,"
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   we always engage in some level of idealization.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Idealization means that we probably collapse a couple of days and we say what we want to do,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   but none of us are able to ever do on an ongoing basis what we desire to do ideally.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   So while I'm going to describe what is a true and authentic day with the things that I do,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   recognize that probably at best we would keep to this 60 to 80% of the time.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   And so don't think that somehow this happens every day
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   or that Joshua's life is just so buttoned up that he can do all of this crazy stuff.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   It's not true. I can't.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   And also recognize that by the time you hear this,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   nay, even as I record this, this has changed.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   Here's why.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   I am choosing a day to share with you from the time where,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   a unique period of time, which was a few months back,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   prior to the birth of our fifth child
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   and during the time when I was working basically exclusively with my family.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   I wasn't working in my business. I was working in my family.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Any time that we're expecting a baby, I do my best to help my wife have a little break,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   have a few weeks off where she can relax, she can sleep extra,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   she can just be in fighting form.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   And so I took a few weeks off prior to the birth of the baby
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   and I basically ran the house, ran the homeschool, ran everything with our children while she relaxed.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   I did all the cooking, did all the cleaning and everything, and she had a little bit of a break.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   And so I'm choosing one of those days when I was directing everything.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   But even though I'm going through an ideal day, guess what? We had a baby.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   And when babies come, your whole life goes into chaos.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   50 to 90% of your great habits fly out the door and everything gets disrupted
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   and it takes six months to get your family back on track.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   Trust me, been there, done that. I've learned to account for it.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   So when babies come along, everything goes in chaos.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   So today, as I record this, it's not this ideal day.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   I'm still working to kind of get back to this.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   But there was a window, there was a window in which I was able to do what I'm describing to you.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   Now I'm back at work, my wife is running it, she has her own way that she does things.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   And again, dealing with the upset of the baby and getting everyone on schedule
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   and getting everything back to normal, it takes some time.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   So with those caveats, I hope that you'll enjoy some of the way that I integrate these things
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   that I have gone over in this series with you.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   One final comment, please don't try to do everything that I do.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Again, I don't even do everything that I do on an ongoing basis.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   It's more fits and starts and spits and spurts here and there.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   Just grab one or two ideas that you like and try to incorporate those.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   That's always the key if you want to change habits in your family.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   Just grab one or two things and work on that over time.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   So let's begin first thing in the morning.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   If we're going to begin at the beginning with first thing in the morning,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   we can't actually begin in the morning.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   We have to begin the night before.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   And so a good morning starts with a good night before.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   And that starts with a consistent and relatively early bedtime for children.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   For context, my children are ages 9, 7, 5, 3 and a new baby.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   So with that as context, I don't have any teenagers who are going to stay up till late.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   I put all the children to bed at 7.30.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   And I do that consistently. It's recognized. It's normal. And we always do it.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   And that helps. That consistency helps a lot where they fall asleep quickly
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   and are able to get a full night's sleep.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   And they get a full night's sleep and always wake up naturally.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   Now each of the children will wake up at a different time of the morning.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   They all have their own kind of peculiarities based upon whether they nap or don't nap
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   or the age, etc.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   And it's quite interesting that if you have a consistent bedtime for children,
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   then their bodies will work out on an ongoing basis how much sleep they need.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   And so you can be confident that if this child is sleeping for an extra hour or two,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   the child needs it.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   And if you start bedtime early enough, then you can still have productive mornings,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   which are my favorite time of the day, even though your children may sleep a little longer.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   And so it's very important to me that children are not awakened, if at all possible,
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   with alarm clocks or on schedules, etc., but rather that they get a full, restful night's sleep.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   So in order to help facilitate that, I do my best to make sure they have a consistent bedtime.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   Now obviously 7.30 is a little early.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   If we're out at friends' houses or something like that, then certainly on occasion it's 8.30 or 9 o'clock.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   But I try to avoid that primarily because children, it's just hard for them.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   If they're used to going to bed early and they're up past their bedtime, they get miserable.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   Everything gets difficult.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   And so I try to keep to a consistent bedtime.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   When the children are sleeping, I try to keep the room completely darkened, curtains pulled as dark as possible,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   no night lights, no flashing lights, nothing, and I keep the room cool.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   Those are the things that work to help adults get significant amounts of sleep,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   and they are similar for children.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   And so the children all wake up at different points of time.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   Remember that sleep is the time that your body grows and refreshes and cleanses itself.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   Sleep is the time that your brain cements memories.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   Sleep is the time that your cells cleanse themselves.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   So sleep is one of the fundamental habits of good health and longevity.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   And we want to teach children good sleep habits at an early age.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Benjamin Franklin was right. Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   So I say early to bed, good long night's sleep so that you can get a full, restful night's sleep
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   is a cornerstone of good health, good brain function, everything.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   When the children wake up, they are allowed to have quiet time.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   They can do what they would like to do.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   I don't direct their morning time.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   And so each of them has different interests.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   Sometimes they'll read books.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Sometimes they'll play with toys.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   They have access to audio books, so some of them can read audio books.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   And the only rule that I have is I try to keep them quiet.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   I have a few that are more rambunctious than others, so it doesn't always work.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   But that's the intention. It's that you can do what you like that is quiet.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Sometimes in the morning they'll go play outside.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   We have a great yard, all kinds of things out in the yard that they can go play with.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   And so they have their choices.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   Generally, I'm the one who makes breakfast, and so I will prepare breakfast.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   And my focus with breakfast is to create the highest protein
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   and the highest fat meal that I can.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   And generally we have just a handful of meals that we cycle through.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   I'd like to introduce some more variety.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   Not everyone is always super excited about eating the same thing over and over again,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   but I try to stick to those nutritional principles.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   I believe that when designing a menu or when designing a diet for children,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   if we can get high protein and high fat and cut out any kind of junk food,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   no bunch of sugar, no empty carbs, no junk food,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   then with that we offer children food,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   and they will learn to naturally regulate their appetite and eat what they need.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   And I've watched this with children, that sometimes they eat a lot
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   and sometimes they eat less depending on what their body needs.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   And so what I try to do in terms of my theory and philosophy of food
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   is keep the house full of good food so that I don't really have to say no
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   to any particular choice.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   I don't want a box of Oreos or something that there's going to be fights over.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   I want to make sure that all of the food in the house is going to be of acceptable quality,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   and then we eat meals regularly.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   And I don't entirely prohibit snacks or something,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   but we eat often enough on a regular basis that I don't think that that is necessary.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   So for breakfast, the most important focus is, of course, eggs as a superfood
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   that gives you high protein, and then I try to get as much fat in as possible.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   And so that fat involves olive oil cooking.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   If you're cooking scrambled eggs or omelets with olive oil,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   I try to get fat in with whole milk, et cetera.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   And so this is my staple.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   Generally some eggs with vegetables or omelets in them and cheese on top, et cetera.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   But that's my focus is high fat and high protein
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   in order to give the body the most important nutrients.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   The children enjoy bread, so a couple times a week I don't eliminate bread completely,
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   but we'll have some toast along the side, bagels here and there, et cetera.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   But I try to focus on protein and fat there.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   As I'm making breakfast, I will use the morning breakfast time
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   as a chance for us to sneak in a little bit of something for the brain and the body.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   And so generally what I do is I call the children about 10 minutes before I'm actually ready,
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   have everybody sit down at the table,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   and I use that time for something related to listening.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   I'll serve a glass of milk.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   I have a great relationship with a local farmer,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   so I'm able to buy full fat raw milk direct from the farmer.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   The cows are all grass-fed, et cetera, so it's the best quality that I can find.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   And so that gives good dairy consumption, great fat consumption with the full fat raw milk.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   And so I'll give them a glass of milk and encourage them to drink that.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   And then we'll use that time either in some listening time or some learning time.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   So last year we went through an audio Bible in a year, and so we listened to 10 to 15 minutes.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   Those are daily recordings of the audio Bible every morning at breakfast.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   Right now this year we started learning ancient Greek,
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   and so I'll bring the computer to the table and I'll put on a YouTube video that's ancient Greek.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   Right now I'm using Alpha with Angela, which is a YouTube channel,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   and also Luke Ranieri's Ancient Greek in Action series as a way of introducing ancient Greek.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   And so I'll play a 10-minute episode or something while I'm finishing up the food, getting everything set.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   Recently we've been making a big focus on bringing our children up to standard with regard to chores.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   We've been really weak on them being useful and productive in cooking and in chores and setting the table and doing dishes, et cetera.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   And so that's been a big focus of ours.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   For a time, because of having so many young children, we had a housekeeper who would come and who would work with us and do a huge amount of the work.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   And recently we've just said, "This is not going in the direction we want it to go.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   We really need to improve the character of our children."
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   And so I've also been, of course, engaging in character training at that time,
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   and so focusing on teaching them to be useful, teaching them to cook, et cetera.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   We'll sit down to breakfast and we will eat.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   I generally eat fairly quickly.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   They generally eat a little bit slower.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   So after I eat, then I will usually start reading.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   And basically if you've ever talked to a homeschool mom who has her morning basket, that's basically what I have and what I do.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   I have a variety of different books that I will read and a variety of different activities that I will do.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   So we will often read some poems.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200]   I will read poems.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   I have books of poetry for children.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   I have books of poetry dedicated to character qualities.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   And then we do a poet study for a term during -- as part of our homeschool curriculum as well.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   So I'll read a couple of poems.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   The children, I have some that they memorize.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   And so it's really fun.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   I say the poem.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   We say it together.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   And we just practice reciting poems.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   So that's one thing that we'll do in the morning.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   I will often read a -- we have a great catechism book that I use for religious instruction,
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   and I'll go through the catechism questions and we work through that.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   I also will read a lot of stories in the morning as well.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   And so I have several books on virtues and characters that have illustrative stories.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   William Bennett's book on virtues is really good.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   I'll grab a story or two from that.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   I have various other books on character qualities and virtues that talk about it.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   So we'll take a moment and try to do some instruction in terms of character qualities and talk about those things
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   so that throughout the day, if at all possible, we can catch each other expressing those virtues and doing them very well.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   I will also devote a little bit of time to foreign language reading at the breakfast table as well.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   So right now, we'll do a little bit of Greek before breakfast, and then I'll usually read in German for 10, 15, 20 minutes at the end.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   And so the way that I do that, since I'm not particularly skilled in German, is I use my favorite language app called LingQ.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   I bring the German stories into that.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   Any German story that I can get in a digital copy with no DRM locking it up, I bring into that.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   And then I use the sentence mode in LingQ to give me a sentence-by-sentence Google Translate translation.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   And then I stumble through with my pretty poor German pronunciation, but it allows me to read to the children.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   And because they're into the stories, it's not a painful or difficult thing.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   So breakfast will probably take generally 30 minutes or so, 30 to 45 minutes, depending on how long those activities take.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   After breakfast, we quickly clear up, do the dishes, and then we try to get in some play in the morning.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   And so exercise and play, I believe, sets the foundation for a great brain day.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   And so right after breakfast, we try to go for a family walk, go out in the sunshine and walk together.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   And it's kind of a quasi-exercise walk, quasi-nature walk, nature study walk, et cetera, and a lot of just playing outside.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   So my wife and I walk together, gives us a chance to visit a little bit as we're able, get us stronger and get our hearts pumping, get some steps in for my step count goal.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   And it's just a good habit.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   And that play in the morning gets the children, gets their blood pumping, gets them ready for schoolwork.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Generally at this time, it's around 9 o'clock, is about when we start homeschool.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   And what I always do with homeschool is we always begin with math.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   And I was convinced years ago by Art Robinson that you should always begin your day with math.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   And that this training of starting your day with something hard and difficult is really powerful.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   And so generally speaking, the most difficult thing is math.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   And so we begin with math.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   Recently, we've done a few different changes over the years.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   Normally, I have appreciated the Abeka math curriculum from the Abeka publishers.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   What I like about the Abeka math curriculum is it's a fairly effective spiral math approach.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   And it is very full of drills and repetition, etc.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   But the amount or quantity of work that is necessary is a specific one page, front and back.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   One page, front and back is a lesson.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   And the amount, that volume has seemed like it's a pretty good fit for our children.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   Colorful works, etc. It's not too many pages, etc.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   So I'm not saying that's the best math curriculum, but it has worked for us.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   And so we have continued to use it, generally speaking.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   I have not chosen to wait until the age of 10 to start doing math, like I discussed in the podcast.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   But if I had a child who it didn't seem like math was working well,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   I would drop back until the child had reached that point of maturity.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   And it's not that I don't agree with what I said in the show,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   that caution against doing math too early of an age and the benefits of the alternative.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   It's just that we had started on the normal tradition of doing math at a fairly early age.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   And so we've kind of just continued.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   But I don't want math to be something of tears and frustration.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   I do want it to be hard, because the reason we do math is to get smarter and to do hard things.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   So in terms of my observation of various philosophies related to schooling and homeschooling and unschooling
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   and all of the various flavors, I desire for there to be a lot of pleasure in education.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   But I want to make sure we have some good character-building exercises where we do hard things
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   simply because they're hard, because we do hard things.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   And I want there to be opportunities to do things with a good attitude that you may not necessarily want to do.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   And I feel like mathematics is ideal in application for those goals and for those outcomes.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   So we always begin with math.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   Now, one comment. Recently, as I record this and release it on April 20, 2023,
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   a couple weeks ago, a listener called me on a Q&A show and asked me if I'd heard of Math Academy.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   I looked it up live on the air, and I wound up at a website called mathacademy.us.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   And I read just a little bit about the curriculum, which basically indicates that students are doing very advanced math in high school.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   What I did not get to on air was the proper website that really the listener was asking me about, which is mathacademy.com.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   I later went and looked at mathacademy.com and was very impressed by the idea of what they are trying to create.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   Immediately that weekend, after the Friday Q&A show, I signed up for a couple of accounts on mathacademy.com,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   one for one of my children and one for me, and I started using it.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   And it is fantastic as a math curriculum.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   Let me explain why in case this is of help to you. It starts at so-called fourth grade math.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   And I think that based on what I said, I think it would be fine for a student to just wait and then start directly in fourth grade math.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   The basic idea is that they have taken math curricula and broken everything apart into separate discrete lessons.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   And they are using various algorithms to choose how many problems and which problems to show to the student.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   So the way I described it to a friend that I was telling about it.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   Imagine, so I'm a fan of, let's say, John Saxon's textbooks.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   He's dead now and they're different now.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   But when John Saxon sat down and wrote this great textbook that is used by many students, it's the textbook that I used when I was in school.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   He was creating a textbook for the classes.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   And that was great. It's a great curriculum and going through it, you can learn math very effectively.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   The question is, which would be better, John Saxon's textbook or John Saxon himself?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   Now for a limited time at Delamo Motorsports.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   You're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   Visit Delamo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   Offer in soon. See dealer for details.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   What if you had John Saxon standing next to you and after every single problem,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   he reviewed your work and then he chose you the next problem set to give you based upon whether you needed more practice, less practice,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   you could move faster, you could move slower, etc.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   That is what they're trying to build at MathAcademy.com.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   So I've signed up for it and I have been using that for my eldest and I really, really like it.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   I'm using it for myself as well. I really like it.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   Because it allows you to go through the curriculum and do the practice problems
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   and the algorithm is systematically choosing what you need to practice and what you don't need to practice.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   And I'm very impressed.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   They've also incorporated a lot of up-to-date learning methodologies and best practices into the curriculum.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   I'm very impressed.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   And so thank you to the listener who called me up and told me about it because that is quite useful.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   So we've used Abeka Math, I'm using Math Academy now and also I'm also using Life of Fred books,
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   which I really like because it's an interesting way.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   Now there's many great math curricula out there.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   If you're looking for a good overview of math curriculum, I would encourage you to check out probably Susan Wise Bower's book,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   Well-Trained Mind, and her discussions of math curricula are useful or just go and find whatever works for you.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   So we start with, I aim for about an hour of math first thing in the morning.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   And to connect this back to the reason, math is good for making people smart.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   It makes you do hard things, makes your brain work, it builds day by day, lesson by lesson, you get better, faster, stronger.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   And so we begin with math.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   After about an hour or hour and a half, we take a morning break.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   And what I will do during the morning break is I make a protein shake.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   And so again, I make a shake with fruit, frozen strawberries, blueberries, etc., pineapple, bananas, whatever we happen to have.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   Then I will add quite a lot of protein powder with a few other, sometimes spirulina or whatever other supplements I have.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   And then a bunch of raw milk to make a protein shake that has lots of protein and a decent amount of fat from the full fat milk.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   And so I'll call the children for a break and we will sit on the front porch.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   And during that time, I read to them.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   I try to develop habits around a specific time that we read in a certain language or a specific time that we read a certain book.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   So at the 1030 break, they drink protein shakes and they have a break.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   Meanwhile, I read to them in Spanish.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   So they think it's a break.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   I think of it as Spanish class.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   They think it's fun.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   I think of it as school.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   And it works pretty well because they're excited about it.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   So we have a break.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   Then they run around for 10, 15 minutes, have a recess, play in the yard, come back to school.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   And we proceed through school.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   After the morning math, then we get into a lot of reading.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   And so as a foundation for our homeschool, I primarily focus on using the book list and curriculum at Amblesight Online.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   There are many good book lists and curricula to use.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   I'm very impressed with Amblesight Online.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   It's a remarkable free and -- I guess we can call it free and open source project put together by some very caring homeschool moms that have done a great job.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.200]   And so I use that as our overall spine.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   And then I add to and take away, et cetera.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   But the idea of a Charlotte Mason approach is generally that in the curriculum, there's quite a lot of reading.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   Most of the work that is done, especially in the early years, is never done with textbooks.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   It's always done with living books.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   So a living book is a very carefully written book by somebody who has a real passion for his or her subject,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   somebody who knows a lot about it and who can write in an inspired and enthusiastic and literary manner about the subject.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   And so there's a variety of styles of books, of course, based upon the specific subject that is being covered.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   What I love about this approach, though, is that it's an extremely efficient way to learn
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   because all of the various important components of learning are wrapped together.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   In a literary education, you are simultaneously receiving instruction in good writing as well as good reading, grammar,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   in addition to all of the subject-level instruction.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   And you're doing it in a very memorable way.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   And so the bulk of our schooling approach is simply to have reading lists and read them.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   In the younger years, we do a lot of read aloud, and I make good use of the opportunities to read aloud as well as audiobooks.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   I neglected to say that during math time for my older children, I try to practice what I preach in terms of word exposure
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   by encouraging my younger children to listen to some audiobooks.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   I have some very active young boys that aren't super interested in sitting still and listening to audiobooks,
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   so I encourage it, but I don't require it.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   The key metric, of course, that we talked about in terms of developing the mind,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   the key metric that we want to look at is number of words for developing literacy,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   number of words that a child hears in his life.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   And so what my younger ones do really love is to read books.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   They love it because it's a whole experience, meaning snuggle up with dad on the couch, etc.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   So I'll try to do that, but when I don't have the ability to read books, I'll often encourage them to listen to an audiobook.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   I also encourage audiobooks in foreign languages.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   Their comprehension of those audiobooks seems to be fairly low, but I don't require them to understand,
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   I just require them to listen, and I try to break it into very approachable segments.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   10 or 15 minutes doesn't seem unjust to me to have a child listen for 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   but I'll often let them play, of course, while they are listening.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   I believe that even if they don't have a high degree of understanding in a foreign language,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   simply hearing the sounds is useful.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   There are debates about this in language acquisition circles.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   I don't take a position on those debates.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   I just figure it can't hurt.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   Your brain has to get used to the sounds of a language, so even if you don't understand it,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   still hearing it can be useful, and it builds a habit that can continue on for time.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   So in the morning we will spend a lot of time doing reading,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   but I don't generally hear narrations in the morning.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   I save that for later, as we'll talk about in a bit.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   When possible, I want to incorporate what Charlotte Masoners call "the riches."
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   That's the composer study, the picture study, all of the artistic stuff, drawing classes, etc.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   I'm not as strong as this as I would like.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   My wife is more crafty than I am.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   I am not a crafty guy.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   I don't have the passion for it.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   I recognize it's important, but I'm often more of a "read the books, read the books" kind of thing.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   So I try to temper my instincts and try to bring it in when possible,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.200]   but we have some room to grow in terms of bringing in more art study,
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   more artistic expression, and more composer study.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   So I'd like to see more of that in the future.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   This brings us generally to about noon, and noontime, of course, lunch.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   I don't have much to say at lunch.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   Other than that, I try to use lunch in basically the same way as I do breakfast.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   Generally, we don't consume much food for lunch because I've done the protein smoothie,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   but we'll have food, and the specifics aren't important,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   other than what I've said of maximizing wherever possible protein and fat,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   and then just simply allowing the children to follow their appetites
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   and to help them to learn to self-regulate.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   I think that's something that is important.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   When I was a child, I was encouraged to finish my plate,
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   and I think that because I was encouraged to finish my plate,
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   I didn't learn to listen to my stomach and my appetite,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   and I kind of just learned to eat automatically.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   And it's something that I think has harmed me as an adult,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   that I'm not super in tune with my stomach.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   I can eat or not eat, but it's not like I listen to my appetite.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   And that's probably one reason among many for my lifelong obesity.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   And so I want to avoid that with children.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   But I just try to provide high-quality food with no junk so that, hey,
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   you can eat as much as you like, and then you're not required to eat,
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   but if you're hungry, here's the food that we have.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   And that has seemed to work pretty well.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   And thankfully, we don't have any food allergies
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   or anything that makes things super difficult.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   You never know what works and why.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   I used to think, oh, we could have the perfect technique to expose our children
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   to all the foods and they'll have no picky eaters.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   Well, you have enough children and you realize they're all different.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   And for all I know, this child's a picky eater and it's a genetic thing.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   I have a lot more sympathy and a lot less -- how do you say it?
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   When I had one or two children, I was sure I knew it all.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   And today I'm pretty slow to say what I know
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   because they're just all so unique in and of themselves.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Back to lunchtime, basically I'll repeat the same thing.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   We have a fairly short lunch.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   I'll read.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   I try to read in a couple different languages, as I've said,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   but I also have a list of English books that we read to as well.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   And I want to make sure that the great pleasure of reading
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   in your native language is still a core component of our life.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   And so I will have the children.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   I'll read a chapter of a book.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   It takes about 10 or 15 minutes while they finish eating
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   and then send everyone outside to play.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   And that play, sunshine play, out in the yard, et cetera, is really useful.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.200]   Now what I have tried to do is I have tried to get some various pieces of equipment
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   that would help in all the stuff that I said about the body of movement.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   So, for example, I have a 30-foot rope hanging from a tree
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   and I encourage the children to go up it.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   All of my older children can go up to the top of it
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   and I encourage them to go up a couple times a day.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   And it's play for them, but that's a great way to build strength as far as I can see.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   I have a trampoline and so I encourage them to jump on the trampoline.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   That can help with various things.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   I have a balance board.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.200]   They climb trees, all the stuff, and I just encourage them to be outside
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   and children naturally play.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.200]   So I try to provide some equipment that handles those
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   or contributes to the acquisition of those athletic skills
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   but without it being anything that is forced or regimented.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   I hang up a slackline and hope that they climb on it.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   And some things work, some things don't, but I figure in the fullness of time,
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   access to the stuff, it all works out in the fullness of time.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   And that has seemed like a good option.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   After lunch, it is 1 o'clock.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   I call the children in for 1 o'clock, put the younger ones in bed for naps.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   I, again, think that rest and naps are really important.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   And so what I have generally successfully been able to do
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   is to extend after lunch naps at least to the age of 6.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   I don't have any children that have stopped before the age of 6.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   And the nice thing about that is if you can maintain naps until the age of 6,
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   then you're dealing with a child who can then entertain himself
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   rather than needing to be entertained.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   If you stop naps when a child is 3, then you don't get a break as a parent.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   Mama doesn't get a break and mama needs a break.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   And so by requiring continuance of naps until, again,
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   what has been for us generally about age 6,
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   when children seem to naturally go through a change
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   and they just don't need the nap anymore
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   and they have a hard time falling asleep at night time,
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   then at least if you stop naps, then you can transition from naps to audio books.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   And that's generally what we have done.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   So if a child turns 6 and is not yet reading, then that's fine.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   You don't have to nap, but we're going to have rest and reading time.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   And so reading time for a 6-year-old is audio books.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   And so I require an hour of listening to audio books.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   And the books are generally engaging.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   The children enjoy them.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   But by 6, at 4, the child doesn't have enough of an attention span
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   to listen to an audio book by himself for an hour.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   By 6, that can probably be a reasonable expectation.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   And so I put the younger children down for naps.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   That gives everyone a break.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   And the older children have reading time.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   And, again, varying different ages, sometimes the reading is assigned reading.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   At the moment, for example, for my 9-year-old,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   I have a morning schedule and an afternoon schedule.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   So we do 3 hours of school in the morning,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   an hour, hour and a half, 2 hours in the afternoon.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   That seems reasonable.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   Sometimes I cut it short.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   Sometimes we don't generally go much longer than that.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   It's not necessary.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   And I don't want there to be too much formalized school.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   I just want there to be lots of healthy options for all the rest of it.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   And so I'll go ahead and give my eldest some assignments.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   For my next eldest, who is still cementing reading skills,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   although they've advanced dramatically,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   that's when I do voluntary free reading or sustained silent reading.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   When we talked about literacy,
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   and I shared with you how to develop literacy,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   I don't think I labored on this,
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   but one of the things that is very important to help a child to engage
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   and be a skilled and competent reader is to have significant opportunities
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   for sustained silent reading or free reading.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   The idea is the child chooses the book to read,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   and there's simply an environment where that's what everyone is doing.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   Everyone is reading.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   And so this rest in reading time is a good way for us to incorporate that
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   into our household.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   And so the rules are you can read anything you like for an hour.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   You have to read for an hour.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   You can't go out inside and play for an hour,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   but you can read anything you like.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   And so we have a large library of options,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   and you can read everything from picture books.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   You can read to hardcore.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   You can read anything you like.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   And so in the beginning,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   that often starts with lots of picture books and pictures,
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   and then naturally over time,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   children just develop more skills and they naturally read other things,
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   and they gravitate towards things that they can read
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   and the things that they can't read.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   So in order to encourage reading,
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   what I try to do in addition to the formalized instruction
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   and lots of reading aloud --
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   and by the way,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   the way that we do a literary education for someone who's not a skilled reader
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   in the Charlotte Mason philosophy is you do lots of read aloud.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   So you read aloud or have an audio book to read with it
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   until the child is a strong reader.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   But during rest and reading time,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   then I require you can read anything you like,
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   but you do need to be reading.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   And that is really important.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   There's good evidence in the reading research circles
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   that if schools would just incorporate sustained silent reading,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   then the levels of literacy go up significantly.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   And so what you need for that in a school setting is you need a library
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   with a variety of books,
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   lots of different books to appeal to different people at different levels
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   based upon different interests.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   And then you need a quiet environment and you need an example set.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   So the teacher, for example,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   should be reading during that time,
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   and this is the time that we're going to read.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   So take 30 minutes, teacher reads, children read anything they want,
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   but that's what we're doing.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   And so I try to incorporate that principle at home with rest and reading time.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   Works very well.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   It's really interesting to me.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   So I try to look for series of books
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   and books that I think will be interesting to the children
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   depending on what age they are,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   and then buy them and fill the library for them.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   And it's fascinating to me to watch.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   I'll take a book, I'll try to introduce it, and it doesn't stick.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   So I just leave it on the shelf.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   And then three or four months later, during sustained silent reading,
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   child comes meandering across it again and says,
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   "Oh, I'll try this," and now the child's ready for it.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   So I let this be undirected because that allows the reader
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   to choose the books that are appropriate at that time of day.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   After lunch, or after this nap time and rest and reading time,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   of course we just have the afternoon.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   And my general focus with the afternoon is that the children have time.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   I think that children need time,
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   and I don't want to fill up the day too much with school.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   I think that it's really important for children to have abundant free time
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   to play, do projects.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   Sometimes those are fun, sometimes they're not for us as parents.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   Sometimes your house is a wreck, sometimes it's not.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   Probably more uptight than I should be.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   I aspire to be one of those happy-go-lucky parents,
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   but I also can't abide a mess,
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   and finding the right balance is challenging.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   But I try to make sure that children have lots of time to play,
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   lots of sunshine, lots of physical activity, just play.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   And that's one of the great benefits of having a bunch of children,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   is they always have playmates.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   And that is a lot easier than if you have only one child
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   and you've got to continually either play with the child
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   or you've got to go and find continual playmates and playdates for children.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   And so play is, I think, a cornerstone of what is important for a child
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   to develop social skills, to develop conflict resolution skills,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   to develop imagination, etc.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   And of course the children are allowed to read as well or play games.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   So those things change.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   What I have tried to do is make sure, in the same way that food--
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   it seems to me a lot easier just to eliminate all junk food from the house
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   and then allow children to eat whatever they would like.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   It seems the same thing I can do with activities.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   So I'm not saying video games are bad,
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   but I don't want my children sitting around playing video games
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when the sun is shining.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   Maybe if it's a rainy day, you can't go outside, etc.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   But I think children need to be outside,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   playing in a physical world primarily outside.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   And so we just don't have any.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   We don't have TV, we don't have screens or computers that we can use on occasion,
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   but the children have zero access to them.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   So they have audio books, they have real books, and they have outside.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   And to me that seems really healthy at this stage.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   I, again, noticed the ages that I said my children are.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   At an older age, I think there needs to be more opportunities
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   for some of those skills that are necessary.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   So whether it is playing games, whether it's working more on the computer
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   or engaging in those kinds of activities, that's fine.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   But I have young children, and I believe young children
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   should primarily be playing outside in the sunshine.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere,
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   Offer in soon. See dealer for details.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   I should also add that one of the things that I have tried to do
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   in order to achieve some of these values and goals that I have
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   is to make it doable.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   So I live on a very large property.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   I have a huge outdoor area with abundant space for the children to run and to play.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   And so that makes it relatively easy for me to chuck them outside and say,
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   "I don't want to see you for an hour."
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.200]   Whereas, obviously, if we lived in a small suburban lot
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   or if I lived in an apartment or something, it's much more difficult.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   So that has been an intentional decision because I don't see how we could
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   go and take our children to the park every afternoon.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.200]   It just doesn't seem to fit where we are as a family.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   But it has been very useful to be able to chuck the kids outside
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   and say, "I don't want to see you for an hour."
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   And that's how I grew up.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   That's how a lot of us grew up.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   To me, it seems super healthy and really valuable.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   And so that's a choice that I have made is to try to live on a property
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   that facilitates that kind of lifestyle, that kind of vision.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   When it gets to about 5 o'clock to 5.30, somewhere in that range,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   depending on what's happening with the games,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   then I will end playing and send children to go and get a shower
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   and get their pajamas on.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   This has helped quite a lot to have less work after dinner.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   We've been in the world of young children.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   And those of you with young children know you often--as a parent at least--
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   I am often pretty tired by the time you get to dinner time.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   And I don't look forward to bath time, etc.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   And so by doing it before dinner, it leads to a more peaceful evening.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   And that's generally been a good winner for us,
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   at least at this stage where we are currently.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   We'll have dinner.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   Similarly, at dinner time, what I try to do is to enjoy conversation.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   And with young children, it's been challenging
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   to facilitate productive conversation.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   You spend so much time as a parent training--
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   don't touch your food, use your fork and knife,
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   lips closed when you chew, swallow before you speak, etc.--
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   that it's hard for my wife and I to have really good conversations.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   We're working and not interrupting, etc.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   You can imagine if you have a bunch of children come over to your house,
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   you can imagine that it gets pretty loud.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   And so we work hard at that stuff,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   but it just doesn't facilitate a lot of long, drawn-out conversations.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   I'm looking forward to older years
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   when we can have hour-and-a-half long dinners and have conversation.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   But it has been hard at this stage to make that a reality.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   What has been effective as a conversation starter
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   is when I switched to hearing narrations of the children at dinner time.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   So if you think back to what I shared with you about narration
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   as a preparation for writing,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   the basic idea is that your children read something
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   and then they tell you about it.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.200]   Now, interestingly, I would call this a form of a memory technique
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   called free recall.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   What narration does is to help a child to remember what he has read.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   In order for proper narration, the reading is done one time,
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   and then the child has to tell you about it.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   And so the child needs to remember what they have read
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   and then compose the thoughts,
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   compose the speech of what you're going to speak about.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   And it's basically a practical technique that we have implemented.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   I've been disappointed, generally, with the quality of our narrations,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   so I have tried to give more focus to it to improve them by practice.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   And so hearing narrations at dinner time has been a winner.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   Because it allows me to go around the table
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   and have a chance to ask,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   "Tell me about this chapter of this book that you read."
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   And for the older children,
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   it is something that was on their school checklist for that day.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   For the younger children, it was something they listened to,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   and I try to let them be involved as well, and they enjoy that.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:44.200]   Interestingly, this has also been useful of having children at different ages.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   So we have children of different ages
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   who are going through the same curriculum.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   And so one benefit of doing this narration in a public format
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   at the dinner table that I've observed
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   is that my eldest will be reminded of a book that he read two years ago,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   which is different than the next one down the line, etc.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   And so that's been a neat thing to see work.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   And so that gives us a good topic of conversation
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   from what has been read.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   And then this is also helpful because as a father,
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   I'm looking for chances to engage in instruction,
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   moral instruction, discussion, etc.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   And that's where we get over into the world of logic
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   and philosophy that I talked about.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   So if we're reading a book, and I have read it or not read it,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   at least if I have a narration, I have a sense of it,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   so we can talk about it.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   What do you think about these actions?
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   Why was this right or why was this wrong, or what was happening?
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   This is a huge value of having a literature tradition in your family.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   Many times there are lessons that you want to give to your children,
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   but those lessons can be quite awkward
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   if you try to give them based upon real people.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   I read an essay from a mother who was talking about teaching her daughters
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   about interpersonal relationships with women.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   And she was talking about how although technically
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   she could tell her daughters,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   "You know that bitty in the church pew over there?
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   Notice how she is always doing such and such to try to get that man.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.200]   What do you think about her actions?"
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   That would, of course, be inappropriate.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   That would be gossiping about a person, and it's a person that you know.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   You don't want to put those thoughts in your children's minds.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   But if you read your way through Pride and Prejudice with your daughters,
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   you have all kinds of opportunities for fruitful discussions
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   about interpersonal relationships among women and women and men
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   and them snagging each other and all of those things.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   So this is something that I greatly value
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   because as parents there's so much that we need to instruct our children in,
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   and yet it can be hard to remember it all.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   But having a literary tradition where we're reading books
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   that are challenging books, and then talking about those books
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   in the form of narration gives me a chance as a father to say,
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   "Well, let's talk about this. Was this right or was this wrong?
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   How was this person looking at it?"
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   And then doing this in a historical context is very, very valuable.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   They do this in schools, by the way, obviously.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   You read about a historical character and you discuss it,
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   but I think that's only maybe 20% of the value.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   If you were an English literature major, you have a lot more of this
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   in college at a collegiate level.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   But this is so limited in high schools and elementary schools
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   because, number one, there's not enough time for reading literature.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   There's too many textbooks, not enough literature.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   In the textbooks, life is presented and situations are presented
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   as black and white rather than the many nuances of gray
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   that exists in real life.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   And you have too many students and one teacher
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   to have a really fruitful, productive conversation.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   I don't know what the max number is.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   Perhaps those of you who teach English literature or French literature
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   and have discussion groups can tell me, but I would guess it would be
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   5 to 10 would be the maximum number of students that you could have
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   in a really compelling discussion group.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   So it can't work in a class of 30, especially when the students
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   haven't had enough time to read it.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   But I've really been enjoying the use of narration at the dinner table
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   and a literary form of education because you get those benefits.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   When a child is reading through the form of a biography--
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   my eldest is reading the biography of George Washington Carver right now--
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   and so you read a really beautifully compelling biography,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   and not only does that biography interlace with a biography
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   of General Grant and a book about Abraham Lincoln
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   and history understanding of what was happening during that era of history,
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   of the Reconstruction after the Civil War in the United States,
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   not only does that help with history knowledge, but of course
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   you start to grapple with those great moral questions,
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   those discussions that were running through society and continue today.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   But instead of reading about them in the form of a dry textbook
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   saying "here's what happened," you're reading about them
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.200]   through the struggles of an individual, through the exact experiences
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   of an individual. And I find this really useful,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   to have fodder for good conversations and to help somebody
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   wrestle with those things that they are encountering.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   Then at dinner, sometimes if the conversation is not flowing,
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   I'll often read again. I get concerned, I don't want to read too much,
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   and so I want to teach conversation. I believe that teaching children
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   to be skillful conversationalists is of a high priority,
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   and if you're just sitting around listening to reading all the time,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   that's not going to accomplish it. So we want to have good opportunities
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   for conversation, but I will often take 15 minutes and read a little bit more
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   after dinner. After dinner we clean up, obviously clear the table dishes,
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   etc. And then in the evening, it depends. I try to make it a point
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   to have some form of family together time, so reading is an appropriate thing,
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   but sometimes it doesn't happen, especially with babies and such.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   And so they'll have another 30-40 minutes after dinner where they can engage
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   in sustained silent reading, play with toys, play a game together, etc.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   Just basically quiet activities before bed. And then we have bedtime.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   And then in bed, a couple things that I've tried to do to nurture the spirits
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   of my children is it's a special time to look forward to, to snuggle,
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   to read together. I read often from the Bible or a storybook of Bible stories.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   For those of you who would like a suggestion, my favorite book of this genre
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   is called The Child Story Bible by Catherine Vos.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   It's a really beautifully done story Bible where she is faithful
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   to the original account, but she adapts the scriptural text into more
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   of a literary format that is appropriate for children's stories.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Really, really excellent. And so that's what we'll often use,
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   and the children enjoy that. They enjoy the stories.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   And then we sing together several songs. We do hymn study in Charlotte Mason
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   approach, so we sing those hymns. Also I teach them other hymns that are
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   from my personal history and songbook, and they really enjoy singing together
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.200]   just as a time of being together and snuggling and singing and reading.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   When I was a boy, that was my favorite thing. My dad would come in every evening
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   and he would sing songs with us. And so that's one of the things that I value
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   from my childhood, and you pass these traditions along on a generational basis.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   Obviously when I'm reading, it's always lights out, totally black room.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   If I'm reading, I read with a flashlight. Or if I'm singing songs, I just read
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   the words on my phone at a low brightness. So this allows children to get calmed down,
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   get ready to go to sleep. Sometimes the littlest ones or the most tired ones
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   will drift off to sleep. And it's a great way of calming them down and just
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   having close time. And the nice thing about it is once they're calmed down,
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   then that can often lead to better discussions with little children.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   Often at the table, they're all wound up, they're all arguing over each other,
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   talking over each other, don't want to listen. But that time at night
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   is a really nice way of having conversations. And one of my primary goals
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   as a parent is to maintain a closeness with the hearts of my children.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   I want to always be tightly connected to them. And so having that built into
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   the routine is ideal. It's not ideal for me sometimes because I lie down,
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   I get tired, and my evening work often suffers. I want to go to bed quickly myself
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   instead of being bright and energetic. But it's something that's important to me
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   that the children value and of course I value as well. There are many days
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:52.200]   where just last night I didn't sing with them and I didn't read to them.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   I just put them to bed quickly because I couldn't do it. I was too tired.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   But I do remind myself that these days are very short. And when you come down to,
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   you hear the advice that I give often about parents and starting businesses
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   and such. I'm at the point in my life where if I were going to start working
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   70 or 80 hours a week on some new sideline business, I couldn't do it.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   I couldn't do it without giving up this time that I value. Now clearly,
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   what I've described about this ideal day, as I said, this doesn't involve my working.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   This is totally different now. Not totally different, but it is quite different now
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   that I'm back to work. I'm still there for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   I still do what I've described at breakfast, lunch and dinner, but I'm not there
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   in the morning and I'm not there in the afternoon. I come home at 5 o'clock,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   a little after, and grab the baby and basically do the same things I'm saying,
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   but I have more time to work. But if I brought in, instead of working a 7 or an 8 hour day,
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   if I brought in and just went back to a 10 hour day or a 12 hour day,
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   then you can imagine how that would disrupt some of these things that are important to me.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   And recognize also that if you're a parent, that this time of your life is very, very short.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   So what I've described to you is appropriate for younger children,
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:15.200]   but if you've got a 14 year old, then now social activities become much more important.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   My wife and I, we have tried to minimize as best we're able to a lot of extracurricular activities.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   So our children aren't on the sports league, they're not in symphony or anything like that.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   We don't leave our house much during the week, but that will not always be the case.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.200]   Your children at 12 have an entirely different set of needs.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   They need different relationships, etc. So when we get into that stage,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   then the stage that I'm in right now will be gone.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   And so I'm not going to go and start working 80 hours a week at this stage,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.200]   because the price would be all of these hours with my children.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   The price would be snuggling in bed with my children.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   I used to work in the evening. I used to read, I used to be productive, I used to work.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   I'm behind on lots of projects now because I go and snuggle with my children for 45 minutes,
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   and I get up and I don't want to go back and face work again,
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   because now I'm tired and ready to go to bed.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:15.200]   And so I'm aware of that. If I want to work in the evening, I can't go and snuggle with my children,
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   because I know that I'll be sleepy and won't really want to get back to work in the evening.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   So recognize that this is what I'm trying to do is in practicality mention to you this stuff in detail,
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   so that you can recognize how it plays out.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   It's not that you can't go and build a great business when you've got a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old and a 5-year-old.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   You can. The cost is these hours that are gone.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   And there's a pretty good chance that your 15-year-old is not just going to be thrilled
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   about snuggling with you and singing songs for an hour at night.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   He's going to have other priorities.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   And obviously you still want to engage with them, but it's just different.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   But at 5, treasure those moments, because they're here and gone before we know it.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.200]   Last thing is, obviously I pray with the children, and then in terms of nourishing the spirit,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   one of the things that my wife and I have done, she was the one who did it first, and now we've worked together,
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   is we've written songs for all of our children.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   I'm not willing to share them with you, because they're quite private and personal,
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   but basically the songs are super simple. I'm talking 30 seconds long.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   I'm not serenading for 3 and a half minutes, 30 minutes.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   But basically, to tell my children, "I love you," and to talk about my ambitions for them.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:41.200]   My children mostly have some form of virtue names, and so those virtue names fit into their character,
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   my hope for them.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   And so that gives me a chance to make sure that at least every day I know that
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   if I didn't tell them I love them separately, at least I sang it to them.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.200]   And they don't go to sleep without their song, without hearing their song.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   And so you build a habit into your child, and then you have the accountability of
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   we don't leave without saying, "I love you."
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   And when I think about that, it makes me really happy, in terms of knowing what that can do
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   in the heart of a child, to know that every single day I've said, "I love you,"
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   and I've talked about who you are going to be in the future.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   I've given you a vision of who you are to be.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   And these are virtues and character qualities that are important for you to fulfill.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   This is important to me. Years ago I heard about...
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   I never bothered to go and research if it was true.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   It was probably Zig Ziglar. He would tell this story about this tribe in Africa
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   that would name the children based upon the days of the week that they were born and their names.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   And one of the things that was remarkable is their names would have different meanings,
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   and yet there was one name that was super negative, that would be the children
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   that were born on Wednesday had this super negative name.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   And a dramatically, statistically important population of the people who are in prison
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   shared that name. And the idea is not that names are determinative,
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   but that your name is something that you live up to in many ways.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   And so I want to give my children ambitions about, "This is what your name means.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   This is who you are to be as you grow and mature."
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   And then finally, one of the things that I try to do,
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   even in saying it I realize I've been lacking recently,
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   but one of the things I want to do is in addition to saying, "I love you," that's easy,
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   but I try to say every day, "I'm proud of you."
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   And what I find that does is more for me than for my children.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.200]   Obviously, I want my children to know that I'm proud of them.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:55.200]   But in the hustle and bustle of life, it becomes easy to focus on everything that's wrong.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   If you've got a five-year-old or a nine-year-old, you know, right?
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.200]   There's so many things that you can pick on.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   And by the end of the day, as a parent, sometimes it's hard to remember
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   that you're proud of your child. Of course you're proud of your child.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   But sometimes it's hard to remember that you're proud of your child
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   because of all the things that you saw that needed correcting.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   And so one of the things that I try to do is I try to make these positive statements.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   "I love you" is easy because love, of course I'm going to love you.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   I love you both emotionally but also as an act of the will.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   You're my child. I love you, period.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.200]   But if I say, "I'm proud of you," it affects me in a different way.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:40.200]   And so it forces me to turn aside from all of the needs that I see
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   and the work that I have to do as a father,
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   and it forces me to focus on the areas that my children are excelling.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   And I find that to be really helpful.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   I've instituted this in a few other areas of my life as well.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.200]   For example, a number of years ago, I made the decision to stop saying,
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   "You're welcome," as a response when somebody says, "Thank you."
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.200]   And I made the decision myself to start saying, "My pleasure."
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200]   And it wasn't just because I ate at Chick-fil-A,
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.200]   although I probably did eat at Chick-fil-A or something.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.200]   But I realized that if I said, "My pleasure,"
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   it caused me to reflect on what I had done in a different way.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   And my brain started searching for a way to make it true.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.200]   I don't want to lie.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.200]   And sometimes I don't want to say, "My pleasure,"
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   but if I say it, then my brain looks for a way to say it was true.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   The other night, I was in bed, and my wife was in bed,
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.200]   and then she remembered that there was something that was undone in the other room.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   I forget what it is.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   You know how it is.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.200]   You're lying in bed.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.200]   You're all ready to go to sleep.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.200]   You're snuggled up, and your wife says,
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   "Joshua, I forgot to do such and such.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   Would you go do it for me?"
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200]   The answer is, "No, I don't want to go do it for you.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   I can't you do it.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   You get out of bed.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   Your legs work, don't they?
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   Come on.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:05.200]   I don't want to get out of bed, but I, of course, yes, I'll go do it."
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   And so you go and do it, and you come back to bed, and she says, "Thank you."
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   And I forced myself to say, "My pleasure."
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   Now, it wasn't my pleasure.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.200]   My pleasure would have been sitting in bed and making her go and do it
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   and get out of the nice warm bed and go and deal with the thing that got forgotten.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.200]   But it wasn't a big deal, and it is my pleasure,
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   and it forces me to take the actions when I don't often feel like them,
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.200]   and it reinterprets them to my brain.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.200]   And so that's been something I've been doing for probably four or five years now,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   and it continues to remind me every time someone says, "Thank you,"
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.200]   and I say, "My pleasure," my brain always is searching, "Is that true?
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.200]   Is that really true?"
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.200]   And it finds a way to make it true.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   So after that silly example from whatever it was a few days ago,
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   when I got back in bed, it was my pleasure,
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   and I was thinking, "No, it's not my pleasure," but no, really, it is.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   If my wife weren't here and she was dead and gone in some tragic accident,
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   what a pleasure it would be to be able to get out of bed
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   and go and do something on the other side of the house to serve my wife.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   I'd rather be here and do that than not.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.200]   And of course, two minutes later, I was asleep, no big deal.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   But I try to use a few of these tricks,
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   and so I'm just sharing some of the things that have been helpful for me.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:23.200]   One of those things has been for my children to--just for me to say,
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   "I'm proud of you."
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.200]   And again, it's for me, even more than them,
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   because it forces me to find a way to make it true.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   And even if it was a difficult day or a frustrating day or whatever it was--
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   and it's great, obviously, on the easy days.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   There are some days where it's just easy.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   Of course, I'm proud of you at a fundamental level.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.200]   But it forces my brain to look for a way to justify what I have said,
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.200]   and I find that useful.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   That concludes my commentary on a day.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   If the children are in bed by 7.30,
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   that gives me an hour, hour and a half with my wife before I go to sleep,
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   and the process repeats.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.200]   And of course, this stage of life is pretty much a whirl of day after day after day.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   But I hope that gives you an idea here and there.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   I think that if I look at my list of the stuff that I've covered--let me just review it.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   We talked in the very beginning of the show about nourishing your children's bodies.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.200]   The first couple episodes in this series were focused on preconception
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   and pre-birth stuff that can be done.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.200]   That's a separate thing.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.200]   But in terms of nourishing the body, nutrition is important.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.200]   So I've tried to do my best to provide high levels of nutrition.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   The best quality food that I can have--I go to a farmer's market
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:53.200]   and I buy most of our food, our eggs, directly from a farmer with pastured eggs.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   I buy milk directly from a dairy farmer with grass-fed milk.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   Best quality I can get with the most fat in it.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   I try to encourage other high-fat foods--butter, cream, etc.--where appropriate.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:12.200]   I try to minimize--make sure that there's no junk food, minimize any kind of junky stuff.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   Most of our meals--again, we're not perfect.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.200]   I'm just telling you my philosophy in case it's helpful to you.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   If you think I'm wrong on something, feel free to let me know.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200]   But virtually all of our meals are cooked from scratch.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.200]   We don't really buy--we don't buy anything pre-prepared,
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:34.200]   so that cuts out a lot of the junk chemicals to try to make sure that we eliminate toxins from the food.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:40.200]   Obviously, we can't be perfect, but most of our food is cooked from ingredients.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   We're not foodies.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   We would like to be--neither my wife or I--or gourmet as we would probably like to be.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.200]   Hopefully in 10 years we can have gourmet foodie children that do all our cooking for us.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   But at least we try our best to get high health.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.200]   So I buy vegetables from a farmer.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.200]   My dairy comes direct from a farmer and eggs come direct from a farmer.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   And then I buy meat directly from the farmer as well as much as I can.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:12.200]   I get some organic pastured chickens and beef is--anyway, the details aren't important.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:19.200]   But I try to get the highest quality nutrition and try to make sure that there are abundant levels of protein and fat available
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   so the body has what it needs to grow very large and very strong and as healthy as possible
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.200]   so that even the epigenetics of my children are as well cared for as possible.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.200]   Sleep.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.200]   I try to make sure with what we said, good sleep, lots of movement.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   Most of the movement that I encourage is in the form of play.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   I don't have--maybe in the future I'll be able to lead my children in a daily workout,
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.200]   but at the moment that's not a skill that I have yet developed.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   But in terms of lots of play, children are active, and so I've tried to focus on providing equipment
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:58.200]   that they can build strength, build stamina, build coordination, and et cetera.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.200]   Sunshine with the playing outside, and then good looks.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.200]   That's just a matter of doing our best to help them accentuate their positive features in the fullness of time.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:12.200]   In terms of the mind, I think that I'm doing my best to fill them with as many words as possible
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   through conversation, through reading.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   We do that reading in many languages, so multilingualism can help.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   Writing ability, generally weak at the moment, but getting better on narration.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   Art, music, weak at the moment.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.200]   Hopefully in the coming months and years I'll be able to introduce more of that.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   Memorization, mostly casual, but we're making progress, and as the children get older
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   and I can require more memorization and recitation without my involvement,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   I intend to do more of that.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.200]   We talked about studying formal logic, studying philosophy.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   That's not something we're doing yet, but in the fullness of time we will do more of that.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   And then in terms of investing into the spirit of my children and nourishing it,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   doing my best to provide an environment of stability, an environment of love,
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   give my children a vision for what I expect from them, and teach them explicitly,
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   as I said at the breakfast table, about character, virtue, have ethical conversations
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   as we read these books and discuss about what happened, why,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   what happens if you hang around with stupid people who do stupid things,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   what happens if you work hard and go in other directions,
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:25.200]   try to fill their reading lists with aspirational biographies of good men and women
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.200]   so that their ambitions can come from the greatest of the giants who have come before us
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:35.200]   rather than from just whoever is randomly stuck in a seat next to them.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:42.200]   And then in terms of success skills, I focus on doing my best to teach those lessons
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:47.200]   in the way that I talked about success skills, and then also I have a success curriculum
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.200]   that I impose upon my children as well.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   So I read to them how to win friends and influence people.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.200]   In the fullness of time, they'll read mindset.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.200]   In the fullness of time, they'll read some of the basic success literature
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.200]   that I consider to teach those lessons.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   And I wish there were a high school class in success.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.200]   Goal setting is not something that we formally do at the moment,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.200]   but in the fullness of time, as they can be more directed,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.200]   I want them to engage in systematic goal setting, etc.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.200]   And so that concludes my day, and I never get all of that done in a day.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.200]   There are many days things get mixed.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   After this perfect day that I have described to you, we had a baby,
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.200]   and everything gets upended.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.200]   But a few of the basic things always happen.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.200]   And if you have some of those basic things, the basic things like meals together,
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   at least two meals a day, basic things like good habits,
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   basic things like no junk food in the house,
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   and no junk food for the body, and no junk food for the mind,
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   just productive activities, basic things like a simplified schedule
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   where you're not running here and running there and driving all over town
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.200]   and grabbing fast food on the way, etc.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:04.200]   I try to focus on those basic things that keep things mostly healthy in the family
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:11.200]   so that when there is a new baby or when there is some crazy event that happens
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   that knocks us off course, then we're not off course for too long.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   And that's the idea.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.200]   Being a parent or having a bunch of children, it's not easy.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.200]   It is very draining. It's not easy.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   And for you parents out there, I want to encourage you,
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.200]   as I've said in other circumstances,
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.200]   I think that in some ways being a parent today is harder than it ever was.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.200]   We struggle just like you do to find enough children in the neighborhood
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.200]   for the children to play with.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   We struggle just like you do to find children who have free time.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:47.200]   Everyone's in school all day, and so having time to play is not much of it.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.200]   It's very different than when children had time from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.200]   and they had 30 kids in the neighborhood they could play with.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   And it's very different when communities were closer, etc.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   But we can't lose heart.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.200]   We have to be intentional about the work that we do within our own nuclear families,
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:11.200]   and we have to be intentional about the type of community that we build around us
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   in order to pave the way.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.200]   And I hope that a few of my ideas may be helpful to you.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   And if you have great ideas, I would always love to hear those ideas.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   Call me up on the Q&A show and tell me about them,
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   and let's talk about them more there.
