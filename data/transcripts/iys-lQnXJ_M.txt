[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   I should like in a brief word to express my sense of pleasure and a privilege of being
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.120]   here this morning and also to thank the pastor for his very kind and over generous welcome.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.120]   I find it very difficult to identify myself with the men to whom he referred and what
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.760]   I read on the order of service paper. I am but a humble, I trust, servant of the Lord,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.360]   privileged to expound these amazing truths that will be found in the scriptures. And
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.880]   this morning I would like to read to you in the same chapter from which the reading has
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.560]   already been taken, namely in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 10, beginning to read
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.480]   at verse 19.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.040]   Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.280]   a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.360]   flesh. And having an high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.640]   heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   our bodies washed with pure water. Now those verses follow the reading at the beginning
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   and obviously you see that they deal with this whole question of prayer. Now these words
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   were written to people who are described as Hebrew Christians, which means of course that
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.520]   they were Jews who had been brought up in the old Jewish religion. But having heard
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.560]   the gospel, they had believed it and had joined the Christian church. And clearly for a while
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.240]   they had been enjoying their new faith and their new life. But for a variety of reasons
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.080]   with which I need not detain you, they had become somewhat discouraged and despondent.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.480]   One of the reasons, which is dealt with later on in this very chapter, was that they were
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.880]   being persecuted. The very fact that as Jews they had become Christians would lead to persecution.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.040]   They had been cut out of their families, robbed of their goods, molested and treated in a
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   most malicious manner. And this is always a very depressing experience. That had happened
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.120]   to them. And there were various other factors. And the result of all this was that they had
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.760]   become not only discouraged and despondent, they had even become doubtful of their faith.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.800]   And many of them were beginning to look back to the old religion, the old temple worship
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.160]   and its ceremonial, and wondering whether they hadn't been a little bit precipitated
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.000]   in leaving this old religion, which after all had stood the test of centuries, and taking
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.920]   up and disposing this new teaching. Well now that was their condition. Unhappy, discouraged,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.840]   full of doubts and uncertainties and hesitations concerning the faith. And this of course affected
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.320]   the whole of their lives. But there was nothing more serious about it than the way in which
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.800]   it affected their prayer life. The Christian is a man who lives by prayer. Our Lord himself
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.480]   taught us this. He said that men should always pray and not faint. The alternative to fainting
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.280]   is praying. It's the one antidote to all the troubles in the Christian life. But the
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.200]   question is how can a man who has become uncertain about his faith pray at all? So this man,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.160]   amidst his many exhortations to them, here reminds them of the only way in which anyone
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   can ever pray. And I know of nothing that is more important than this, just at this
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.000]   present time in this difficult world in which we are living. Ultimately we have no resource
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.880]   except that which we have in God. There is nothing more important for all of us than
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.640]   to know exactly how to pray and to pray with confidence. You notice that this man says,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.680]   let us come boldly, which means with confidence. We must pray with confidence. And later he
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.600]   uses the term full assurance of faith. That's how we are meant to pray. Not doubtfully,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.680]   not uncertainly, not hesitantly, but boldly, confidently assured, and with this absolute
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.760]   certainty of faith. So my dear friends, the question we must all ask ourselves before
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.440]   we proceed any further is simply this. Where does prayer come in our lives? What's our
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.320]   view of prayer? Does prayer help us? Do we know what we are doing when we pray? Do we
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.480]   pray with confidence, with assurance, with certainty? Nothing is more important, I say,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.680]   than at the present time, than that we should be clear upon this vital matter.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.720]   Now let me put it like this to you. I wonder whether we've ever realized the difficulties
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.960]   in connection with prayer. Sometimes I find people have never even got as far as that.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.160]   And there of course there are teachings which would have us believe that to pray is simple.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.520]   I remember hearing a man once saying that to pray is just like breathing. No problem,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.800]   no difficulty. And there are those interested in ecumenicity and world church and so on.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.560]   They're very fond of saying something similar. They say we mustn't discuss doctrine because
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.440]   that divides us. But they say there's one thing we can always do. We can always pray
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.840]   together. The idea is that prayer is something very simple. And there was a teaching popular
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.720]   in your country and in my country a few years back which said that all one needed to do
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   in order to pray was just to sit in a comfortable chair and to relax and to begin to listen
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:43.360]   to God. It was as simple as that. A child speaking to his father. No problem, no difficulty.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.240]   Well that's not the teaching of the New Testament. The teaching of the New Testament is that
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.880]   in a sense there is nothing which is so difficult as prayer. Of course we can get on to our
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.440]   knees and talk to ourselves or think beautiful thoughts, but that's not praying. Praying
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:08.960]   means talking to God and knowing that we are doing so. Now this man was aware of all this
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.040]   because these people were finding their prayer very difficult and he wants to help them.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.200]   So he shows them the difficulties in connection with prayer and how alone these difficulties
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.920]   can be overcome. What are the difficulties in connection with prayer? Well let me note
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:35.840]   them to you. Here's the first. Prayer means entering into the holiest. Into the holiest
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.920]   of all. What does that mean? He says having therefore brethren boldness to enter into
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   the holiest. Well now there's no difficulty about this. These people as I have reminded
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.680]   you have been brought up as Jews and they were familiar with the temple and the construction
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.640]   of the temple and before that the old tabernacle in the wilderness. And you remember that these
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.300]   buildings were divided up into various sections. There was an outer court into which anybody
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.840]   could enter. Then there was a next court into which the Jews only could enter. Then there
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.160]   was a place which was called the holy place into which the priests alone could enter.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:25.480]   Then there was a curtain, a veil and beyond that was that innermost sanctum which was
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:33.640]   called the holiest or the holiest of all. And into that only one man was allowed to
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:41.120]   enter and that was the high priest. And even he was only allowed to enter once a year.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.320]   Now why was this? What was this special and peculiar about this innermost sanctum called
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:54.120]   the holiest or the holiest of all? Well the answer was this. It was there that God as
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:01.720]   it were came down to meet the people. He went into that place and there there was an ark
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:09.160]   containing the tables of the law and a mercy seat over it and cherubim covering that. But
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:17.240]   above all there was a strange light there which was called the Shekinah glory, a kind
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:26.280]   of luminosity. That was the representation of the presence of the living God. And that
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.620]   is why this place was so special and only this one man was allowed to enter into it.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:38.200]   And as you read the accounts in the Old Testament of the high priest entering in there once
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.000]   a year to make atonement for the sins of the people, you will read that when he went in
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.360]   the people waited outside in fear and trembling. Why? Well he was going into the presence of
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:59.000]   the living God. And God is holy and just and righteous. And the question was whether God
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   would accept the offering. Whether this man would not be killed by the holiness and the
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.920]   justice of God. Whether they'd ever see him again. So they used to wait and listen.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   And the moment they heard the sound of the jingling of the bells at the bottom of the
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.720]   high priest's robe they were filled with happiness and rejoicing. They knew that the
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.520]   offering had been accepted. Their sins were covered and they could go on for another year.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:33.160]   Well now this is what this man's talking about. Prayer he says means entering into
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:41.800]   the holiness. Entering into the very presence of the living God. And this is a tremendous
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:49.440]   thing. This is an awful thing. This man was so impressed by this that at the end of chapter
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.720]   twelve he comes back to it again and he puts it like this. "Wherefore we receiving a
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:03.320]   kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:13.840]   with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire." No question of running
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.280]   into the presence of God and saying "Dear God" and an easy familiarity. No, no. Reverence
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:30.500]   and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. Now here is the great problem in connection
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:38.640]   with prayer. Here we are finite, fallible creatures and then we enter into the presence
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:48.280]   of this great and august being. Immortal, invisible God, only wires in light inaccessible,
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:57.400]   hid from our eyes. Most glorious, most perfect, the ancient of days, pavilioned in splendor
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:06.560]   and girded with grace. How can one enter into such a presence? Who shall dwell, asks Isaiah,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:13.640]   with the burning light, the burning fire? It seems impossible. The very greatness and
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:20.760]   the glory, the ineffability, the holiness of God seems to make it quite impossible for
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:29.080]   us. And we have to realize this, that that is what we do when we try to engage in prayer.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.680]   But then he goes on to say that there is a second difficulty and that is what he calls
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.320]   an evil conscience. "Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:51.160]   our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." We know something about this, don't we?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.560]   We can justify ourselves before men, but the moment we get on our knees and are in the
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.100]   presence of God, our conscience begins to act and to accuse us. It condemns us. It brings
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:10.760]   our sins back to us and we feel that we are speechless and we feel that we have no right
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.320]   to pray at all. We are suddenly reminded of all our evil and sins and transgressions.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now I needn't keep you with this. There's a perfect statement of all this in a very
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.080]   familiar psalm, Psalm 51. David had committed certain terrible sins, but he seemed to feel
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.800]   that everything was all right. But then it was brought home to him by the prophet Nathan
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.440]   and he writes his 51st Psalm. "And he cries in agony, 'Have mercy upon me, O God,' according
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:47.280]   to thy lovingkindness, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. Blot out my transgressions.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:54.600]   I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, the only
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:02.520]   have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight." Now this is the accusations of conscience.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.560]   That's what happened to the poor prodigal son when he came to himself, wasn't it? He
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.120]   was perfectly happy until he was suddenly awakened, realized the folly and the enormity
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.480]   of what he'd done, the way he'd wounded and grieved his father. And he feels he's unworthy
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.320]   to be called a son. He doesn't know what to do with himself. Accusations of conscience.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.600]   How do you answer them? We can answer men, but how do you answer God and his holy law,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.880]   which we know that we have transgressed and offended? Well, there's the second difficulty.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.560]   But you know there was a third, and this is even worse. He talks here about having our
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:50.640]   bodies washed with pure water. What is this? Well, this is what we call the pollution of
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   sin. The guilt of sin is bad enough, but there's something worse. And that is the pollution
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.640]   of sin. You see, the difference is this. At first, one is worried only by the things that
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:11.080]   one has done, worried as to how these can be blotted out. But there's a stage beyond
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.280]   that. And then you begin to be worried by this. What is it in me that ever made me desire
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.440]   to do those things, leave alone do them? What was it that ever prompted me or urged me to
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:31.600]   do such things? And you realize it's due to a polluted nature, an evil nature, something
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.640]   rotten in our very constitution. Listen to David expressing all this.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   Having acknowledged his sin and having asked for mercy, he says, "Wash me, wash me throughly
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:53.040]   from mine iniquities and cleanse me from my sin." Behold, he says, "I was shapen in iniquity,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:16:00.480]   and in sin did my mother conceive me." Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts and
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.840]   in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. He now realizes the trouble is inside
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.640]   him. He was guilty, as you remember, of adultery and of murder, but that isn't what worries
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.920]   him. Now what worries him is this, that he should ever have desired to do these things.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:22.640]   This evil nature purged me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   whiter than snow. Then the final prayer, "Create in me a clean heart, O God." He doesn't merely
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:40.320]   want to be clean outside. "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.040]   within me." Now this is the problem of prayer. How can
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:53.320]   a man with such a nature enter into the presence of God who is light, and in whom is no darkness
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:02.160]   at all? It seems impossible. We seem so unclean, so unworthy, so vile. How can a man possibly
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.680]   enter into the presence of God and offer prayer? Shall I sum it all up for you in the lines
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:18.120]   of a well-known hymn by Thomas Binney? "Eternal light, eternal light, how pure the soul must
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:26.160]   be, that placed within thy searching sight it shrinks not, but with calm delight can
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:36.240]   live and look on thee. O, how can I, whose native sphere is dark, whose mind is dim,
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:46.080]   before the ineffable appear, and on my naked spirit bear that uncreated being?"
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.600]   Have you ever felt that, my friends? I don't think we've ever prayed unless we know something
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   about this. Prayer isn't just talking to ourselves or uttering up pious hopes and thoughts
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:06.680]   and aspirations. It's entering into the presence of God and his uncreated being, flashing upon
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:15.120]   the innermost parts of our souls and our very existence. That's prayer. It seems impossible.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:21.960]   Our very minds are dark, our native sphere is dark, our minds are dim. How can we ever
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:28.800]   do this? He says, "The spirits that surround thy throne may bear the burning bliss, but
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.040]   that is surely theirs alone, for they have never, never known a fallen world like this."
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:43.960]   How can I? It seems impossible. Well, now there are the difficulties in the way of prayer.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.480]   Prayer is not easy. It's the very last lesson that the Christian rarely learns in a true
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:59.440]   sense. How is it possible? How can one overcome these initial obstacles and apparent impossibilities?
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.160]   Fortunately this man tells us. Thank God for the Gospel.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.560]   The first thing he tells us that is absolutely essential is that we should have a true heart.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:17.640]   Let us draw near with a true heart. What does that mean? Well, that just means sincerity.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:24.880]   We have to be sincere with God. We can delude ourselves, we can fool others, but not God.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:32.800]   As David put it there, "Thou desirest truth in the inward parts. Thou understandest my
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:39.400]   thoughts afar off." Indeed, this man in the fourth chapter has already made this abundantly
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:45.480]   plain and clear. Listen to him putting it. He says, "The word of God is quick and powerful
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:52.960]   and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:59.640]   and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:05.320]   Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:12.400]   naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.180]   So we've got to be sincere. We've got to have a true heart. You can't hide anything
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:24.720]   from God. You can't give him 99% and give back 1%. He knows all about us. So we must
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.800]   be honest and open and sincere. It's a bare essential. But even that isn't enough. Sincerity
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.560]   doesn't admit into the presence of God. Something further is needed. And thank God it's there.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.440]   This is the great theme of this little paragraph that I'm holding before you this morning.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:52.440]   He says that there is a new and a living way which he hath consecrated for us through the
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:59.880]   veil, that is to say, his flesh. He says in spite of these difficulties, there is a new
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.680]   and a living way. Now this ought to appeal to us all at the present time. We are living
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:15.080]   in days of expressways, parkways, these great arterial roads, bypassing towns, taking us
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.760]   direct to our destination. That's the idea here. And he applies this to these people.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   He says, "I can't understand you. You're looking back to the old way, to the old temple,
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.680]   the old Jewish religion. I'm amazed," he says, "that you should even look back and think
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.120]   of going back with the new and the living way that's been opened for us." You notice
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:45.360]   he emphasizes this word "new." It's the difference between the old dispensation and the new dispensation,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.520]   the Old Testament and the New Testament. He says, "Why are you going back? The thing is
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.120]   incredible." And you know, my friends, I feel we need to consider this text at the present
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.360]   time. There are people, even Christian people, who seem to want to go back to some old temple
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:08.600]   and ritual and priesthood and ceremonial that has long since been put right out of date
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.160]   and never in a sense was Christian at all, and here's a new and a living way in the
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:20.240]   meantime. Isn't it astonishing that people always want to revert to some old way that
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:26.280]   was fallible and passing and transient instead of continuing on the new way? That's one
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:33.400]   thing. But then he calls it, you notice, a living way. What does he mean by this? Well,
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.720]   if you noticed the reading, you've got the answer. The trouble about that old way was
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:46.400]   that it was dependent upon men. It was dependent upon an earthly human priesthood. And the
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.960]   trouble with those old priests was that they got older and they began to fail and they
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:57.600]   died and you needed a new priesthood. Constantly changing. But, says this man, we've not
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   only got a new way, it's a living way. It's always alive. He's been making this point
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.280]   in chapter 7. He puts it like this. "They truly were many priests because they were
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   not suffered to continue by reason of death. But this man, because he continueth ever,
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:31.400]   who come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." It's a
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:38.000]   living way. Your priests, your popes, they come and go. Here is one who abides forever,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.840]   unchangeable, Jesus Christ the same, yesterday, today, and forever. A new way and a living
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:53.240]   way. How has it been made? Well, he tells us. He says that this new way has been made
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:01.720]   in the most extraordinary manner. And it has been made by the Son of God himself, which
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:08.520]   he hath consecrated for us, he says, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. How can
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:15.800]   a man enter into the presence of God? There's only one answer. It is by Jesus Christ and
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:21.560]   him crucified. He is the new way. He is the living way. Did you notice the reading? "When
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.000]   he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.160]   hast thou prepared me." You know, when you make these new highways, it's very important
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.400]   you should have a good foundation, isn't it? Otherwise it'll begin to crack and subside
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.280]   and there'll be troubles. You lay a firm foundation, strong enough to bear the weight
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.480]   of the traffic that's going to pass along it. And it's essential here. And what's the
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:58.000]   foundation of this road? It is the incarnation. The Word was made flesh. The eternal Son of
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   God, a body hast thou prepared me. He was made in the likeness of men. He was made in
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.080]   the likeness of sinful flesh. Here's the foundation. Man alone had failed in Adam.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.600]   God alone can't represent us. You need both. The God-men, the two natures in the one person.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   Here's the foundation of this mighty new and living way along which alone we can travel.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:35.240]   God hath visited and redeemed his people. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.120]   But that's only the foundation. What else? He hath consecrated for us through the veil,
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.000]   that is to say, his flesh. And you notice he says, "Let us have boldness to enter by
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:55.840]   the blood of Jesus." Now, now, the incarnation alone wasn't enough. It was essential, but
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.200]   he came in order to die. As this man puts it in chapter 2, verse 9, "He was made a little
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:08.680]   lower than the angels for the suffering of death." But he, by the grace of God, should
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:17.960]   taste death for every man. The broken body, the shed blood, the veil, that is to say,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   his flesh and the blood. What does this mean? Well, my dear friends, it's the heart of
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:33.040]   the gospel. There is only one way whereby a man can approach God. It is by a sacrifice.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.520]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins. That's why you had all your sacrifices
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.320]   – burnt offerings and sacrifices in the Old Testament. That's why a lamb was killed
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.960]   morning and evening. But that's not enough. That simply covered it over temporally. That's
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:56.040]   the old way, the dying way. What's the new way? "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:03.840]   away the sin of the world." God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. God has punished
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.880]   your sins and mine in the body of his own Son on the cross on Calvary's hill. His
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:17.320]   broken body, his shed blood, is the way of forgiveness. God hath made him to be sin for
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:24.600]   us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Or as Peter
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:33.440]   puts it, "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:43.000]   dead to sins, should live unto righteousness. By whose stripes we are healed." It is the
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.920]   only way, the way to God, the direct way, the new way, the living way, the incarnation,
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   the life of obedience, the death upon the cross, the substitutionary suffering, the
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.880]   resurrection, the resurrection, the resurrection of Jesus Christ once and forever. And then
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.040]   his ascension, and he is seated at the right hand of God, ever living to make intercession
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.840]   for us. Now here is the teaching. And this man looks
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.380]   at these people and he says, "Are you looking back to that old way? Do you want to go back
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:23.480]   to unearthly human priesthood with its repetition of sacrifices and offerings? The thing is
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:29.560]   monstrous. Have you forgotten the Son of God? Have you forgotten what's happened? Have
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.240]   you forgotten that here is the only way, the new, the living way, the only satisfactory
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:42.560]   way, the certain assured way, appointed and planned by God himself before the very foundation
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.600]   of the world?" And don't you think we need to hear this word of exhortation today?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:55.080]   Isn't it tragic that men are talking about the repetition of the sacrifice of the death
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.880]   of the Son of God daily, something worked by priests? My dear friends, have we forgotten
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.840]   the glorious history of the Reformation and of the pilgrim fathers and all the mighty
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.640]   men who have gone before us? No, no, let's never look back again. Let's walk along the
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:21.360]   new and the living way. But is it adequate? Is it sufficient? Does this really give me
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:32.800]   assurance? And the answer is an eternal yes. It solves all the problems. Can I face God?
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:43.040]   I can. This is God's own appointment. It is God's own plan and scheme. God so loved
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.800]   the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:56.080]   perish but have everlasting life. It was God who was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:05.120]   himself. It's his own way, specially prepared to admit us into his holy presence. Does it
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:14.760]   answer the condemnation of his holy law? Yes. Christ is the end of the law for sin to everyone
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.760]   who believes in him. What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.920]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemns him in
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:35.200]   the flesh that the righteousness of God might be fulfilled in us. Yes, it deals with that.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:42.560]   What about my own conscience? The answer is still the same. If our hearts condemn us,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:49.200]   God is greater than our hearts and knoweth all things. Whatever my heart may say to me,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.520]   I know that the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin, that God is
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.280]   faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:10.640]   we acknowledge and confess our sins. It silences my conscience. But ah, there's one more
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:20.000]   difficulty. The devil, the accuser of the brethren, the adversary, the one who follows
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   us everywhere and haunts us and mocks us and raises our past sins and horrifies us at the
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   sight of them and reminds us of the holiness of the law of God. How can I answer the accusations
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.800]   of Satan? The answer is still the same. They overcame him, says the book of Revelation,
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:47.520]   by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony. Your adversary, the devil,
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:54.080]   says Peter, as a roaring lion, roameth about seeking a way he may devour. How do you deal
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:01.720]   with him? Whom resist steadfast in the faith. Resist the devil in Christ and he will flee
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:11.800]   from you. Or let old John Newton put it for us most gloriously once and forever. Be thou
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:23.160]   my shield and hiding place. That sheltered near thy side, I may my fierce accuser face
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:32.200]   and tell him thou hast died. And he can't answer. Shield yourselves in the side, the
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:39.840]   bleeding side of Jesus Christ. And there you'll be able to answer your fierce accuser and
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:47.200]   tell him that Christ has died for you and he'll be unable to answer you. Or let me close
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.880]   by putting it again in the remainder of that hymn of Thomas Binney that I've already quoted
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:33:01.560]   to you. You remember where he left us? Eternal light, eternal light. How pure the soul must
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:09.600]   be that placed within thy searching sight, it shrinks that but with calm delight can
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:15.960]   live and look on thee. And then the impossibility, how can I, whose native sphere is dark, whose
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:24.160]   mind is dim before the ineffable appear, and on my naked spirit bear that uncreated beam?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:33.440]   Is it impossible? No, no. There is a way for men to rise to that sublime abode, an offering
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:43.160]   and a sacrifice, a Holy Spirit's energies, an advocate with God. These, these prepare
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:51.080]   us for the sight of holiness above. The sons of ignorance and light can dwell and shall
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:34:02.040]   dwell with the eternal light through the eternal love. The difficulties are real, but they've
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:13.240]   been overcome and overcome alone in Jesus Christ and him crucified. The new way, the
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:24.720]   living way, the only way whereby man, in spite of all that is true of him, can enter into
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:35.080]   the holiest of all and speak to God with confidence as his Father, knowing that he's accepted,
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.600]   knowing that he's loved with an everlasting love, knowing that the very hairs of his head
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:49.760]   are all numbered, knowing that nothing can happen to him apart from God through Jesus
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:59.000]   Christ, who is the same yesterday, today, yes, and though they let off all their bombs
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:08.800]   together and the world be convulsed in the final convulsion, and forever. The one thing
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:16.680]   to make certain of in this uncertain world is that our feet are firmly planted on the
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:26.680]   new and living way, and that we are walking and marching, looking unto Jesus, the author
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.840]   and the finisher of our faith. Let us pray.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:44.640]   O Lord, our God, how can we thank thee sufficiently for love so amazing, so divine? Forgive us
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.880]   that we so often in our folly, like those poor Hebrew Christians, will persist in looking
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:59.320]   back to our own works or to some external religious observances and rites and formularies.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:05.680]   God have mercy upon us. Open our blind eyes, we pray thee, and by thy Spirit so enlighten
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:12.280]   our understandings that we shall see the fullness and the finality and the freeness of this
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:20.120]   new and living way which thou hast made for us in the Son of thy love. Lord, receive our
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:26.640]   unworthy praise. Share thy love abroad in our hearts, and so fill us with it that we
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.200]   shall spend the rest of our time in this passing, evanescent world, singing the praises of him
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:40.720]   who loved us even unto death, and ever liveth to make intercession for us.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:48.000]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.480]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this day, throughout
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:04.000]   the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:13.440]   shall stand in the presence of God and see our Savior face to face and be made like unto
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.400]   him in glory. Amen.
