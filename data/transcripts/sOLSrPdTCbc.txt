[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   I should like to call your attention this evening to three of the verses which we read
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.440]   together at the beginning out of the first chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.520]   namely verses 22, 23, and 24. Verses 22 to 24 in the first chapter of Paul's first epistle
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.960]   to the Corinthians. "For the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.800]   we preach Christ crucified. Unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.760]   but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.120]   the wisdom of God." There can be no question at all but that these first two chapters in
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.920]   this first epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians contain statements which from
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.880]   the standpoint of vital importance in an understanding of the Christian faith simply cannot be surpassed.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.800]   Here in these two chapters the Apostle is dealing with basic issues. He is concerned
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.360]   about the very fundamentals and elements of the first beginnings of the Christian faith.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   And perhaps more clearly than anywhere else in his letters, he sets forth what is absolutely
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:41.000]   essential and vital and, as I say, basic. Now here in this particular case he was forced
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.120]   to do that because of the condition of affairs in the church at Corinth. You remember how
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:58.120]   he opens out his matter, he comes to it almost immediately. It had been reported to him that
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.040]   there were certain unhappy divisions in the church at Corinth. And the Apostle is amazed
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.400]   and appalled at this and realising, as he does at once, that such a thing is only possible
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.520]   because of the failure of these people to grasp the very elements of the Christian faith.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.040]   He again reminds them of them. And so we have this great advantage of having the greatest
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.480]   evangelist that the Christian church has ever known himself telling us what is really the
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   basis, the foundation, the very fount and origin of our Christian profession.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.600]   Now I call your attention to this because I am more than ever convinced that this is
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.540]   something which is perpetually necessary. No man can have even a cursory acquaintance
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.840]   with the long history of the Christian church without knowing that there does seem to be
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.800]   a curious tendency, even in the church herself, to depart from the faith. There is ever this
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   confusion, this uncertainty as to what is the essence of Christianity. And certainly
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.240]   at this present time that is something which is painfully evident. There is this tendency,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   I say, to go astray and to misunderstand. Now the Apostle opens out the matter and puts
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.480]   it to us like this. There is this tendency in the world, first of all, the world of the
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.520]   Greeks and the Jews outside the church. They, as I am going to show you, are in a state
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.120]   of great confusion as to what the Christian faith, the Christian message really is. And
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.600]   as it was true then, it is true now. It is extraordinary. I am never tired of repeating
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   this. And I have to go on repeating it because I am so constantly finding it again in conversations
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.840]   with people, in newspaper articles, in books. It is constantly coming before us. This tendency,
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.480]   I say, on the part of men and women to think of the Christian message and the Christian
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.120]   faith and the whole essence and being of the Christian church in terms that are entirely
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.240]   removed from the New Testament position. There is then, I say, that misunderstanding outside
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:27.320]   the church as to what is the very essence of Christianity. But alas, as the Apostle
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.040]   here makes it so plain and clear, this is a confusion that is not by any means confined
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.080]   to the world outside the church. It comes into the church. And when it comes into the
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   church, it is devastating of necessity in its effect. What is the Christian message?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.960]   What is the Christian faith? What is it really to be a Christian? In 1954, it is as essential
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.140]   as it has ever been to ask that question and to face it quite honestly. Moreover, it seems
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.720]   to me that as I am privileged to resume my ministry here in this place, I can do nothing
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.600]   better than start with something that is fundamental and foundational. There is no greater tragedy,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.920]   I say, than that men and women should assume that they are Christian when in reality they
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.160]   are not. Now the Apostle goes on to explain here that if these people at Corinth had but
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.240]   realized what is this basic principle, they could never have been guilty of their sad
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.720]   divisions. You remember how he puts it to them. He puts it like this. He says, "Is
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.320]   Christ divided? You have divided yourselves up." He said, "But is Christ divided?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.280]   Would you have divided yourselves like this if you had thought of it in terms of Christ?"
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.320]   He asks, "In whose name have you been baptized? Were any of you baptized?" He asks, "In
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.800]   my name? Were you baptized in Paul's name? Were you baptized unto Paul?" The thing
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.480]   is monstrous. But you see, forgetting this pivotal, central, vital thing and being interested
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.400]   as they were in things that belonged to the periphery and the circumference, even if there,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.760]   because they had forgotten this central thing, they had gone entirely wrong. So the Apostle
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.800]   calls them back to the beginning. He takes them all the way back to the foundation and
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.600]   he asks them to consider with him what in reality is the Christian faith in its beginnings,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.360]   in its essence, in its foundation. Now there is no point in proceeding to anything
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.520]   else unless we are clear about this. In the next chapter the Apostle uses words to this
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.680]   effect. He says, "Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.320]   of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to naught." And then in the
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.800]   third chapter he says, "I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:03.160]   as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ." The Apostle, the wise teacher as he was, knew
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   that it is rather a pointless thing to do to go on to more advanced doctrine if people
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.880]   are not clear about the first doctrine. So he starts again with the first principles,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.800]   with the elements, with the essentials of this Christian message. And what is that?
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.920]   Well you notice he goes on repeating it. "It is none other than this message concerning
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:37.480]   the cross." "It is this message concerning Christ crucified." "Christ sent me,"
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.720]   he says, "not to baptize, but to preach the gospel." "Not with wisdom of words,
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.640]   lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. For the preaching of the cross
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.400]   is to them that perish foolishness put unto us which are saved. It is the power of God.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.040]   The Jews require a sign, the Greeks seek after wisdom, we preach Christ crucified." He
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.600]   goes on repeating it. And then in the next chapter you remember, "I determined not
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:15.160]   to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified." And there were some
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.360]   foolish people in Corinth who thought that the Apostle did not know anything else because
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.680]   he preached this and this alone. He did it deliberately determined because he was anxious
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:33.320]   to show them that this is the message. And unless we are clear about this, any profession
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.920]   of Christianity on our part is but vanity and is but a delusion. Very well, then the
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:46.760]   message of the Christian faith is Jesus Christ and him crucified. That's the message. That
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.560]   is the message of the Christian church tonight. We preach this person. He goes on using his
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:59.280]   name. Did you notice it? "Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.840]   We preach a person. And we preach a person crucified upon a cross. That's why we have
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:15.200]   this table, the bread and the wine, the communion. It's Jesus Christ and him crucified. That's
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.360]   the message. Well now let's observe together some of the things that the Apostle tells
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:26.240]   us about this message. The first thing you remember he tells us is that this is a message
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:34.560]   which men never expect and which they never desire. He says, "The Greeks, the Jews require
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:42.200]   a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom." They're always seeking something else and
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   they're always expecting something else. This is a remarkable thing, this. It's always
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.560]   true. The gospel message, the real message of Christianity, always comes to the natural
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:02.240]   men as a surprise. It's never what men thought it was going to be. Now this is simply a simple
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.840]   fact of history. It's clear, isn't it, in the ministry of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:16.520]   Christ himself. He was constantly surprising people. They couldn't understand him. He
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.160]   wasn't saying what they thought he should say. He wasn't doing what they thought he
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.680]   should do. You remember his own brothers, after the flesh, they didn't understand him.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.880]   They came to him, as we are told in the seventh chapter of John's gospel, and they said,
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.880]   "You know, if you are the Messiah, if you are what you claim to be, why don't you go
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.200]   up to the feast at Jerusalem and declare yourself?" They thought he ought to be doing that, but
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.880]   he didn't do what they thought he ought to be doing. And that, I say, was constantly
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:53.760]   true of him. It was the trouble with the rulers also, likewise. They couldn't understand
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:00.120]   this person, so they went to him repeatedly and they asked him for a sign. They said,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.520]   "You're talking about the Son of Man. You're making claims for yourselves if you are whom
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.280]   you say you are. Why don't you give us a sign from him? Why don't you do something
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   that will make the thing absolutely unmistakable?" But you know, this misunderstanding, this
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:26.240]   element of surprise, was not confined to those who didn't belong to his inner circle. You
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:33.600]   had it even amongst the inner circle themselves. Do you remember that even John the Baptist
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:41.120]   couldn't quite understand him? He sent two of his messengers to him one day and put this
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.440]   question. "Go," he said to him, "and ask him this, 'Art thou he that should come, or
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.600]   do we look for another?'" John says, "In effect, I thought at first that you were the Messiah,
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.160]   but I don't understand you. If you are, why don't you declare yourself? Why don't you
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.720]   become crowned as king? Why don't you set up your kingdom at Jerusalem? Art thou he
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   that should come? Art thou the expected deliverer, the expected Messiah, or are we to look for
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.440]   somebody else?" Even John couldn't understand him at times.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   The apostle Peter, you remember, stumbled in the same way. "There at Caesarea Philippi
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.040]   he made his great confession, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.' And then
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.320]   our Lord went on to explain to the disciples how he'd have to die. And Peter protested
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.880]   and said, 'Far be it from thee, Lord! This must not, this cannot happen unto thee.' And
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.560]   our Lord had to rebuke him, saying, 'Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest not
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.680]   the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.'" Constantly his message,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:56.240]   his behavior, his whole course came as a surprise to men, surprise to the outsider, surprise
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:03.640]   to the disciples themselves, and especially when he speaks about the cross and when he
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:11.120]   directs attention to his death. That's the story of the Gospels.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.560]   And then when you go on, as we go on here, to the writings and to the message and the
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:22.280]   preaching of the apostles, you'll find it was exactly the same thing. The Greeks couldn't
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:29.480]   understand this message about a cross. They regarded it as foolishness. The Jews stumbled
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.840]   at it. They didn't want this. This idea that this is the Messiah, one who is condemned
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   as a felon and nailed to a tree, it's impossible, they said. They stumbled. It's an offense
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:49.760]   to us. They didn't expect it. They were surprised at this message of the cross. It was the thing
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.360]   that always was a source of trouble to them, Greeks and Jews.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:03.520]   And it is still the same. It is still the same in the world. It's still the same in
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:11.560]   the church. Men seem to be able to talk about Christianity without mentioning the cross.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:20.200]   So often there is a gap and a gulf which seems unbridgeable between men's statements and
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.920]   the Lord's Supper and its message. It isn't vital, it isn't central, it isn't pivotal.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:32.960]   It's something that seems to be outside and irrelevant. Men don't expect it. They're
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.440]   not ready for it. They don't seem to take it and to understand it.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   Why is this? What was the matter, you think, with the Jews and with the Greeks in the time
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.640]   of the Apostle? What was the matter with the disciples? What's still the matter with
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.840]   men? Why is it that this message, with its central emphasis upon a cross and the death
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.880]   of the Lord, should come as a surprise to people?
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:07.320]   Well, I think the answer is provided here by the Apostle himself. The real explanation
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:18.160]   is that men think that they know what they need. The Greeks require a sign. The Jews
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:25.800]   require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom. And it's because of that that they are surprised
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:32.160]   when the message of the cross is brought before them. This, I say, is indicative of the fact
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.440]   that men think that they know what they need. They think they understand their own condition
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.520]   and therefore they're able to prescribe for themselves. And what they think they need
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.560]   is still the same. The world hasn't changed during the last two thousand years in a spiritual
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.240]   sense. You've got the representatives of the Jews and of the Greeks in the modern world.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.560]   There are large numbers of people tonight still expecting from Christ a sign. No, no,
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.040]   they don't expect a cross and a message about a death and atonement. They're still seeking
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:13.440]   for a sign. What I mean by that is this. They're seeking for some demonstration which will
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:21.040]   give them some absolute proof and certainty of the being of God. I needn't specify,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.640]   I needn't come to details. You're familiar with that kind of thing as it is round and
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:34.040]   about us at this present time. People are interested in the unusual, in the odd, in
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   the strange, in anything that savours of us, suggests the miraculous and the supernatural.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.320]   Come, let me put it bluntly and very simply. Why is it you think that there is more interest
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.840]   in healing tonight than there is in the message of the cross? Everybody's interested in
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:58.480]   healing, Christ as a possible healer of physical diseases. There's a great interest in it.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.080]   Yes, people say, "I'm prepared to believe that. I'm prepared to believe that when
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.160]   the doctors are failed, this other power can come in. They believe in power, unseen forces.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.360]   There's tremendous interest in that. Why are men more ready to be interested in that
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:18.440]   than in the cross of Christ? You see, it's the old desire for a sign. We want some kind
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.720]   of certainty, some kind of certitude. We want some demonstration. The people were always
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.400]   asking for it, as I've already reminded you from our Lord. As the devil tempted him
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.780]   to throw himself down from the pinnacle of the temple and to give an unmistakable proof,
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.400]   so the people were constantly asking for the same thing. They said, "Moses, when he led
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.600]   the people, he gave manner. What are you giving? Why don't you do something? Do something
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:51.760]   that will be absolutely unmistakable, and then we'll believe." They require a sign.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:18:01.000]   And modern man, in his misery, in his distraction, in his unhappiness, is looking for a sign.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.480]   The simple message about the cross doesn't interest him. But you give him something unusual,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.680]   something that appears to be a kind of phenomenon, something phenomenal, and at once he'll begin
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:17.120]   to pay attention. He thinks he knows what he needs. He thinks he understands the situation,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:23.080]   and he feels that all he needs is some unmistakable proof, some signal opening of the heavens
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:31.120]   and a manifestation of the power of God that cannot be gainsaid. That's his attitude.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:39.160]   And there are also the representatives of the Greeks, those who are seeking wisdom,
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.600]   those who are interested in understanding. There's a great interest in philosophy today.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.560]   There's a great deal of talk about the search for truth, the quest for reality, the belief
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:58.160]   in knowledge. Men are interested in this, and what they really think they need is some
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:04.240]   further enlightenment, some further understanding. No, that was the thing that was expected of
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.720]   our Lord. It was the thing that was expected of the apostle Paul when he went to preach
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.040]   in Greece. They regarded him as a sort of philosopher, and they were expecting him to
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.760]   propound some marvelous new philosophical theory which would lead men a little bit further
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.840]   on in his quest for truth and for reality. But the apostle didn't do that. He just
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   stood before them and told them a story about a person who'd lived as a carpenter and
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.120]   who'd been crucified upon a cross and whose body was taken down and buried in a grave.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.440]   But who had risen from the grave on the third day and had manifested himself unto certain
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:50.960]   people, not one belonging to the great schools of rhetoric and philosophy and oratory, not
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:59.120]   a great philosopher, a simple man, crucified upon a tree. The message of the cross. And
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.920]   they said, "This is folly. We want ideas. We want something that we can hold on to with
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   our minds. We want enlightenment. We want to go forward in the quest for truth, and
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.160]   you're pointing us to a cross, and you're saying that it's all there. This is folly,"
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.640]   they said. "It's impossible."
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:26.000]   The Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom. And the modern world is still
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.360]   full of this. But here, I say, still comes the old message with the cross and the death
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:42.520]   and the agony and the burial and the resurrection. Well, I ask again, why is it that men thus
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:51.400]   expect the wrong thing? Why are they thus seeking the wrong thing? Why are they seeking
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:57.440]   signs? Why are they seeking after wisdom? There's only one answer to that question
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.760]   according to the Bible. It's this. It is the failure of mankind to realize the truth
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:11.000]   about itself in a state of sin. The trouble with the Jews and the trouble with the Greeks
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.320]   in the time of the apostle Paul was that they didn't know the truth about themselves as
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:23.080]   sinners. You see, let me put it like this to you. What they never realized was that
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:30.720]   what mattered above everything else is their relationship to God, their whole position
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.880]   as over and against God. They'd never stopped to realize that. Indeed, many of them, like
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:45.000]   most people today, had assumed that their relationship to God was all right. They took
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.480]   that for granted. And taking for granted, as they did, that their relationship to God
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.960]   was all right, they thought that all they really needed was a little help and a little
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.240]   aid. They believed that they were seekers after God, the Jews especially. They'd got
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.480]   their scriptures. They were religious people. They said, "We are God's people, and what
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.040]   we want is, well, a further bit of knowledge about God, some demonstration, some proof,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.200]   some sign from the heavens." They said, "This person claimed that he was the Messiah.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.240]   How can he be the Messiah? He was crucified in weakness. If he really had manifested some
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.340]   divine power, we'd have known that he was the Messiah. But he didn't. He was crucified
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:39.240]   in weakness." And so they rejected this message of the cross. And it's exactly the
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:48.520]   same with the Greek type, not considering their basic relationship to God. Men feel,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.440]   men feel that all they really need, I say, is a certain amount of aid, a certain amount
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.640]   of help. Here they are, seekers after God. Yes, they say, "We believe in God, but we
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.040]   are not clear. We can't see God, and we haven't got absolute proofs. Now what we
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.720]   want is some help. And can philosophy help us? Have you a teaching that will take us
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.160]   a step further forward? Or can you give us a marvelous sign? If we see a miracle happening,
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.920]   well, then we are prepared to believe. But this is just a message of yours, and it's
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:23.720]   a message about a cross, they say. It seems wrong. It's irrelevant." That's why mankind
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:31.000]   is surprised at this message about the cross. Men do not realize that it's their very
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.520]   relationship to God at the center that constitutes their real problem, that they don't know
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.840]   God and are in the wrong relationship to him. They are confident in themselves and in their
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.680]   powers. They ask for a little help. They need something fundamental. It isn't help man
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:24:01.700]   needs. He needs complete deliverance. And so, the message of the cross is still the
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.600]   only message. Though the apostle Paul knew perfectly well that these Greeks were seeking
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.840]   after wisdom, when he went amongst them, he determined not to know anything among them
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.320]   save Jesus Christ and him crucified. He'd studied philosophy. He could have argued with
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.640]   them about it. He could have debated. He knew it, but he knew that he couldn't save. The
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.840]   message was the message of the cross. He knew that what they needed wasn't wisdom, but
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:40.440]   what? Well, salvation and regeneration. And likewise with the Jews. And so he went on
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.800]   preaching this simple message of the cross. The Jews required a sign, and the Greeks seek
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:56.160]   after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:04.920]   the Greeks foolishness. So I say that mankind in the first place always finds this message
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:13.320]   of the cross surprising, strange, bewildering, perplexing. And it's all due to a failure
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:21.200]   to realize the nature of sin. But I must go even a step further than that. The apostle
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:28.480]   takes us to a second statement. The message concerning the cross is not only a message
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:37.080]   that surprises men, it is a message that men resent, a message that they dislike. Here
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:48.320]   are these terms, you remember, "a stumbling block," "foolishness." This message is
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:55.200]   not merely surprising, it's annoying. It's rarely a rock of offense, it's a stumbling
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.520]   stone. It's something that men regard with annoyance and with contempt. They did in the
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.120]   days of the apostle. They did when our Lord spoke about it. I've reminded you of that.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.800]   There after Caesarea Philippi even, when he mentions it, Peter can't abide it. The disciples
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:21.280]   stumbled at it. These Jews did, the Greeks did. There is an offense in the cross. I am
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:32.200]   not romancing, my friends. This is still true. The preaching of the cross is still an offense
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:40.360]   to men. You can tell him about Christ as a teacher, as an exemplar. You can tell him
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.040]   about Christ, as I've said, as a healer, and he doesn't object to it. But you tell
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:53.200]   him about the blood of the cross, and he resents it and he dislikes it. The offense of the
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.840]   cross is as real as it was in the first century. Very well then, let's face this doctrine
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:04.760]   and let's ask again the question, why is this? Before I deal with it, let me make this
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:10.840]   simple statement. There's a very good way of knowing whether your view of the cross
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:18.440]   and of the death of the Son of God upon it is the true view or not. Is your view of the
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:25.720]   cross of Christ an offense to the natural men? If it isn't, it isn't the true view.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:32.440]   The true view of the death of Jesus Christ upon the cross has always been an offense.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   Invariably. When he preached it, when Paul preached it, when Peter preached it, it doesn't
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.800]   matter who preached it, it's always been an offense. Is your view of the cross something
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:48.160]   that offends men? Or, let me put it very plainly, is your view of the cross that it's just
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.080]   a great tragedy that this innocent and beautiful and marvelous person was misunderstood by
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:59.680]   his contemporaries and that they put him to death? That doesn't offend anybody. Is your
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.800]   view of the death of Christ on the cross that it's just a passive resistor, a pacifist
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.280]   if you like? That never annoys anybody at all. Is it just some demonstration of the
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:16.880]   love of God? That certainly doesn't annoy, that pleases people. They say it's marvelous,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.440]   it's heartbreaking, it's the most wonderful thing the world has ever known. That never
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:28.960]   annoys anybody. That's never a stumbling stone or a rock of offense. But this message
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:36.080]   is an offense. It always has been, it still is. Well, very well, I say, is our view of
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:44.360]   the cross such that it is an offense to men by nature? Well, why should it be an offense
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:54.440]   to men by nature? The answer to that is that the message of the cross has certain implications.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:02.640]   It's its teaching that annoys us. It's its meaning, its message. Men are annoyed
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.120]   when they hear this preaching of the cross because of what it tells them. And what does
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.960]   it tell them? Well, again it brings us back to this terrible question of sin. And that's
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.640]   the thing that men can never abide. Our Lord's own teaching did it. It always annoyed the
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:25.960]   Pharisees because, you see, it worked like this. The Pharisees regarded certain people
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.720]   as sinners. They thought that they were all right, that they were not sinners. But when
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.080]   they listened to the preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, they were made to feel that
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.720]   they themselves were sinners. And they hated him for it and they couldn't stand it. He
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:49.240]   humbled them, and he always does. Now, the cross is the place at which that happens supremely.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:56.560]   What is the message of this cross? What is it I hear? What am I taught as I look at the
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:04.800]   Lord Jesus Christ dying upon the cross on Calvary's Hill? Well, the first thing it
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:18.360]   proclaims is this, that we are all of us condemned sinners. Every one of us. Jews and Greeks.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.400]   And they were not only amazed at it, but they were annoyed at it. You see, the Jew regarded
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:29.440]   himself as in a special position. He divided up his world into Jews and barbarians. The
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.080]   Jews, God's people, all well with the Jew, all wrong with everybody else. The rest were
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:40.480]   dogs outside the commonwealth of Israel, beyond the pale. And the Greeks, you remember, had
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:47.360]   a similar kind of classification. The Greeks, the men of wisdom. Everybody else, barbarians,
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.120]   ignoramuses. Every man finds himself in a privileged position. Yes, but this message
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:59.600]   of the cross comes and it demolishes our positions. We are all reduced to a common level. The
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.880]   Jew is made to see that his privileges as a Jew do not save him, and the Greek, with
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:12.920]   all his wisdom, is told that he is lost.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:18.440]   The cross is a proclamation to us all that we have all sinned and come short of the glory
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:27.880]   of God. There is no difference between Jew and Greek, barbarian or Scythian, bond and
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:37.680]   free, male and female. The whole world lieth guilty before God. The cross of Calvary's
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:45.280]   hill is first a revelation of the holy heart of God. It reveals God to us in his unutterable
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:52.080]   purity and sanctity and holiness. And it says you have to stand before him. There is no
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:32:01.520]   volume in all you have bursted up. There is the question and the problem. God's holy
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:13.480]   law, God's holy character, God's holy being. And as I look at Christ upon the cross I am
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.760]   determined that I must believe the statement of this same apostle in his second letter
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:24.560]   to the church at Corinth, in which he says this, "We believe that if one died for all,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:33.200]   then we are all dead." Why did Christ die upon the cross? And there is only one answer,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:44.720]   and that is that all men were guilty before God. There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:52.680]   And all our righteousness is but as filthy rags. Oh, it is not surprising that Paul preached
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   this. Wasn't it his own experience? Wasn't it the very thing that he had to go through
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:11.040]   himself? Look at that proud Pharisee. He had lived as he thought to please God. He had
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:18.000]   studied the law. He had given himself to fasting and sweating and praying. He had exceeded
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.260]   all others in this religious life of his. He will tell you all about it in the epistle
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:28.560]   to the Philippians in the third chapter. And he was boasting of it. He built up this tremendous
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:36.680]   mound of righteousness. What a good, what a religious, what a wonderful man he was.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:43.840]   And yet he tells us that when he came face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ, he saw
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:51.240]   that it was all but dung and refuse, all loss, not the slightest value in it at all. He saw
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.400]   himself as a sinner, and as vile a sinner as anybody could be. He says he is the chief
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.280]   of sinners. It is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception, he says, that Christ Jesus
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:10.760]   came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the chief. Says this religious, moral,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:17.640]   zealous Jew. He's been brought down by the cross, and as a natural man he didn't like
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.520]   it, and men have never liked it. It's a stumbling block to the Jew because it denounces
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:30.960]   his righteousness and demolishes everything upon which he has hitherto relied, and likewise
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:45.760]   with the Greek. Face to face with God, we're all lost, we're all undone. There's no
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:52.280]   division amongst men tonight when you look at it in that way. It doesn't matter whether
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:59.040]   you're wealthy or poor. It doesn't matter how learned you are or how ignorant you are.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.200]   It doesn't matter what your background is, what your circumstance is, what your family,
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:12.800]   what your country. None of these things count at all. Before God we are all lost. We, none
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.960]   of us have glorified him as we ought. We don't know him as we ought. We can't please him
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.920]   as we ought. That's the test, that's the standard. The standard isn't morality, it
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:32.760]   isn't understanding, it's God, it's personal. This isn't theory, this isn't some philosophy.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:41.640]   The whole essence of religion is a knowledge of God and a communion with God. And it is
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:51.780]   there, I say, that the cross condemns us all and shows that we've all gone short. And
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:58.640]   men dislike it. It strikes at our pride, it humbles us, and hence the offence. But you
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:05.760]   see it doesn't merely stop at condemning us, it goes further. It not only tells us
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:13.720]   that we're all guilty, but it tells us that we're all helpless. It isn't merely that
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.600]   we've sinned against God and haven't pleased God. Further, I say, we can do nothing about
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:26.360]   our condition. We are not only estranged from God and under God's wrath, we can't do
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:34.480]   anything to deliver ourselves. That's the message of the cross. Isn't it quite inevitable?
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:42.640]   Haven't you ever thought of it like this? Have you ever asked this question? Why is
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.560]   the Son of God there? What's he doing there? Why should the Son of God be crucified and
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.680]   suffer and die? Why is that? And you know, my friend, there's only one adequate answer,
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:02.280]   and that's this. There was none other good enough to pay the price of sin. He only could
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:10.440]   unlock the gates of heaven and let us in. Surely it stands to reason, if there was any
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:16.680]   other way whereby God could forgive us and our sins and reconcile us to himself, he would
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:23.160]   never have allowed that. Are you asking me to believe that the God Almighty allowed his
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:28.840]   son to go through that agony and that suffering? If there was any other way, there isn't another
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:37.000]   way. You and I are as helpless as that. Sin is as foul as that, and our sinful state is
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.800]   as desperate as that. It's no use going out and saying, "I'll turn over a new leaf.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.600]   I'll give up certain sins and start living a better life." My friend, it won't help
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:52.120]   you. If you spent the whole of your life from now until you're dead in trying to please
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:57.080]   God, you'd be no nearer to it than you are at this minute. No, no, the message of the
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:03.560]   cross is this, that man cannot save himself. The Son of God has come because nothing else
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:17.880]   and no one else could do it. And that is why men dislike the preaching of the cross. It
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:25.960]   says no to our self-confidence and our assurance. It says to all of us, however strong our wills
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:32.840]   may be, however great our determination, however intense our moral effort, "Vanish useless!
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:43.160]   Give up! Stop! Get on your knees! Confess your sin! Cast yourself upon his mercy!"
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:52.920]   And man doesn't like that. Man is proud and self-confident. He believes he can make
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:59.640]   himself fit to stand in the presence of God. He believes that by doing good and helping
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:05.880]   others and being philanthropic and all these things, that he really can stand before God.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:20.600]   The cross of Christ is an everlasting no to it all. He died because no man can ever save
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:30.360]   himself. So I say just a last word, which is this, that in spite of men being surprised
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:39.800]   at this preaching, in spite of men resenting it, it is still the Christian message, and
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:49.080]   there is no other. I say that this mighty apostle Paul preached it, though he knew that
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:56.600]   it offended the Jews and that the Greeks dismissed it with disdain as unutterable folly. He preached
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:06.760]   it. Why? Well, I'll tell you. He preached it because it's a fact. It is the simple
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:21.560]   and the startling fact that nearly 2,000 long years ago, God sent forth his own Son, made
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:28.360]   of a woman made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law. That's the message
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.680]   of Christianity. That's the thing I'm commissioned to preach, and if I don't preach
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:38.360]   it, don't listen to me. I'm simply here as a mouthpiece to say this, that the Son
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:44.760]   of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, has been in this world, and he came to taste death for
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.120]   every man. He came to go to the cross. The cross wasn't an accident. It wasn't something
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:58.520]   that happened in spite of God. God planned it. God sent him to it. "For this hour,"
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:08.360]   he says himself, "I came into the world. He came to die." It's a fact, my friend.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.840]   Whatever you and I think of it by nature, whatever our reaction, the fact is this, that
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:19.160]   the Son of God has died upon the cross. The most amazing fact of history. It's taken
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:34.120]   place. It happened there. There is a green hill far away, outside a city wall, where
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:46.200]   the dear Lord was crucified and died to save us all. It's a fact, and I preach it as
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.800]   a fact. I'm here to proclaim it, not to understand it, above everything not to try
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.600]   to philosophise it, lest I, with the Apostle, say that the cross of Christ should be made
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.960]   of none effect, not with wisdom of men. I'm simply announcing it, that the Son of God
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:12.360]   has been in the world, that he died for the sins of men. I proclaim the fact.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:24.120]   I go further. I proclaim that it is God's way of salvation. We preach Christ crucified
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.440]   unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness, but unto them which are
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:38.400]   called both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God. God sent him
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.680]   there because there he's making the way of salvation. It's the only way, I say it
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:53.360]   with reverence, that even God can forgive men. It had to happen. He hath made him to
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:43:05.320]   be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be the righteousness of God in him. God hath
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   laid on him the iniquity of us all. By his stripes we are healed. My dear friends, they
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.680]   laugh and scoff, though men say I'm out of date and that I'm a fool. I preach it,
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:28.080]   why? It's God's way of salvation, God's wisdom, God's power. God's way from hell
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:39.660]   to heaven, from man to himself. God's wisdom, God's power. And lastly, we preach it for
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:50.880]   this reason, that there is no other way of deliverance. I think I've demonstrated that
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:44:05.400]   to you. If this is God's way, there is no other way. And to reject this means to remain
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:15.680]   in your sins. We don't like the doctrine of the wrath of God today. No, no, that doesn't
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.760]   work. Men have never liked Biblical doctrines. They didn't when Paul preached. How can
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:27.560]   you expect them to like it today when a little man like myself is attempting to say it? I
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   am not here to say what men seek. They seek wisdom, they seek signs, but I am here to
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:44.080]   proclaim truth, and the truth is the wrath of God upon all who have sinned against him.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   But he offers a way of deliverance. He sent his son to die that that wrath need not abide
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:45:02.440]   upon you. And if you believe it, you are forgiven. You need never fear the wrath of God. You
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:11.000]   can know yourself as his child, and you will go on to share eternal bliss with him.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.680]   My friends, that's why I preach Jesus Christ and him crucified. The alternative to him
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:28.960]   is darkness and blackness, desolation and doom. It's not my business to try to solve
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:34.200]   the international problem. I don't know enough. The Church can't do it. She's not
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:40.000]   commissioned to do it. She doesn't understand, and her interferences and her pompous statements
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.040]   do more harm than good. The message of the Church is this, Jesus Christ and him crucified,
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:55.160]   a saviour for lost souls, a deliverer for men who are going to perdition. God's plan
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:08.320]   of reconciliation. Do you believe it? That's all that's asked of you, is that you believe
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:17.240]   it. "The world, by wisdom," says Paul, "knew not God." And when the world, by
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:27.480]   wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of this message preached, "to
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:38.200]   save them that believe." That's the question. If you believe it, you're saved, saved by
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:48.240]   it. So I ask a question. Did you know that you were a sinner? Had you realized your utter
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:54.520]   hopelessness and helplessness face to face with God? Had you realized that if all Paul's
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:00.200]   religiosity and his morality and all his good deeds were done and refused, that the same
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:07.300]   applies to yours? Had you realized that nothing you've ever done or ever can do can possibly
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:15.000]   put you right with God? Did you know that? Did you believe that? That's the first thing.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:24.120]   And then did you know and believe that God sent his own Son to bear your sins, and that
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:32.600]   Christ died for you and for your sins, and thereby reconciled you to God, and that thereby
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:43.480]   you are saved? That's the message. You can't afford to neglect it. You're in a passing
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:50.640]   world. We're all moving on. Time doesn't stand still.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:59.360]   I have only one question to ask you. Have you believed this everlasting gospel? If you
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:06.320]   haven't, can't you see that there's only one reason for it? That you're blinded by
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:14.680]   the God of this world. Cry unto God to save you and to set you free. The alternative to
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:23.940]   believing the everlasting gospel is everlasting destruction. Let the broken body and the shed
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:34.280]   blood plead with you tonight to save yourselves from this untoward generation, to flee to
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:44.400]   him who alone can save you and who saves with an everlasting salvation. Cry unto him now.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:52.520]   If you've seen it tonight as never before, thank him now and begin to enter into training.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:49:03.080]   But when that great anthem is sung, you'll be ready to shout that hallelujah. God, Christ
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:13.400]   in God, and God in Christ is all in all. That's the story. That's the chorus. That's the
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:23.680]   song of heaven. God, Christ, the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:32.440]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:40.280]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:53.840]   the remainder of this short, uncertain, earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.920]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
