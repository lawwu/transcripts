[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   I'm a full-time teacher, but previously worked in journalism.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.960]   I'd like to develop a side hustle writing about using walking to explore the history
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.960]   in London.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.040]   My long-term goal is to write a short book or walking guide on whether I should start
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.560]   a blog as I want to be writing more frequently to sharpen my skills.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.860]   Well, Andrew, I'm going to use this whole desire of a side interest in producing a book
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.880]   about walking histories of London to test out our productivity perspective.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.600]   If you are haphazardly busy in your teaching job, it is going to be very unlikely you are
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.480]   going to succeed with this endeavor.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.820]   You'll have moments of inspiration, other times where you feel like you have no leeway
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.840]   to work on it, the project will make some progress, and then because of haphazardly
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.460]   busy periods will disappear for months, you might sour on the idea, you might lose your
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460]   momentum.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.300]   On the other hand, if you have a productivity framework in place, if you feel like you really
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.200]   do have control over the various obligations and your time, and when you work on it, you're
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.600]   capturing, configuring, controlling your teaching responsibilities, now you have a shot at succeeding
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.560]   with one of these projects.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000]   You can figure out, do I have time for this?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880]   Where is that time best placed?
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.320]   And then actually place that time in those locations.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.880]   And there's all sorts of different options for how you might do this, but you're not
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   going to be able to know what options are available or what is best until you really
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.780]   do have a framework in place in your professional life that is helping you control everything.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500]   Now I'm going to give a particular suggestion.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.200]   So assuming you do this, you get a control productivity system in place, you feel in
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.860]   control of your time and obligations.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.780]   I was thinking about your specific project here, writing this book, Walking History,
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.700]   and your question in particular about, should you start a blog?
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.740]   Is that going to be the right way to sharpen your skills and build this out?
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.380]   Well, my instinct is this project is probably a quality over quantity play.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.420]   I think you want to be producing specific walking tours.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.580]   Let's put the digital channel aside for now, but producing particular walking tours at
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.660]   a very high level.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.640]   So well-researched, either well videoed or photographed.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.440]   You have a map that you can follow it.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   Not that often.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   Sometimes once every month or once every couple of months, but when you release one of these
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   things, it's really, really high quality, really easy for people to follow and use.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.600]   It seems really professional.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   This is the like Mr. Beast or Tim Urban frequency of content production where it's not every
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.780]   three days, but the stuff they put out, they've made excellent.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.920]   I think that's what you're looking for here.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   Be so good.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   The stuff should be so good.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   It can't be ignored.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.680]   I think that's going to be the most fulfilling for you and be the best foundation for eventually
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.600]   then collecting these into a book.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.020]   The channel question, I'm not sure.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.400]   I think if you just had a blog, sort of web 2.0 style, you had a domain and a WordPress
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.680]   blog that might be not enough given the way that digital media has evolved.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.920]   You probably need some other sort of media involved here.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.500]   I mean, YouTube could be a big player here.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.160]   You could have very well produced videos where you're actually doing this walking tour, maybe
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.760]   sub stack as opposed to just so people could subscribe and you get sent these walking tours.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.600]   It would be a narrow band of people subscribing, but you would have a good band of followers.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   You could carefully put your toes in the professional social media.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.520]   Obviously, I'm not a big believer in spending people using social media as a source of personal
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.200]   distractions, something people are on on their own time just to sort of keep up with the
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.040]   world and be distracted, but an Instagram account, a professional Instagram account
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.900]   where it's just for you, whatever, posting the photos from your latest tours that you're
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.240]   working on as it builds up to you, then launching your latest tour on a website connected to
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   sub stack.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   I don't know the right mix there.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   You probably need a more heterogeneous mix than just a blog, but that would be my guess
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   is that once you get control over your teaching life, you have that productivity framework
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.600]   in place.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.880]   You'll be able to build a rhythm where you build up to once every couple of months, a
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   great tour.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.680]   I would imagine you do, you put aside a Saturday to really explore and scout things out, and
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.760]   then you have some sessions to do your background research and writing, and then you have another
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.480]   session a few weeks later where you actually go to do the video or photographs for the
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.360]   very nice actual tour put together.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.040]   I would also say, don't hesitate.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.280]   I wouldn't hesitate too much about spending some money on this as well because you're
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.040]   getting, you will get great satisfaction out of producing these really good tours.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.080]   So if you gather all this information and then you're hiring, you're paying 200 bucks
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.960]   to an online contractor to then put it all together digitally in the right format so
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.760]   that you don't have to spend 30 hours trying to figure out how to do that.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.200]   I think that's a very good investment of money, those type of strategic investments.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.520]   So that would be my guess.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.600]   Quality over quantity is the way to build not only towards a book, but just to enjoy
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   this as you go along.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.400]   But none of this is possible unless you leave haphazard business and really feel like you
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.240]   have your arms around your day job, you have that productivity framework in place.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   I don't know.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   What other channels do people use, Jesse?
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.840]   If you were, I mean, there's sort of people who've been grandfathered into just having
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.920]   their own blogs like Marginalia, which used to be Brain Pickings.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.960]   I think Tim Urban with Wait But Why, Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   I don't know.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.480]   Starting from scratch though, it's difficult, I think.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   I agree with you.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   I think you need multiple mediums.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.840]   I think the key is just don't let your professional use of a medium be your excuse to have your
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.920]   personal life devolve into consuming that medium.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.480]   It's like you can do the Ryan Holiday thing and have stoic quotes on Twitter, Instagram
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.340]   photos of these sort of cool places you are and these videos that you've made without
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.320]   actually being on Twitter yourself and reading what other people said, without actually being
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.840]   on Instagram and scrolling it all the time.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.280]   So there's definitely a professional mindset that I think helps there.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.240]   You can also, I mean, he was saying how he wanted to work on his writing.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.720]   You can also do that with both mediums for sure.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.040]   And see, I'm not as worried as he seems to be in sharpening his writing skills because
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.480]   he's a full-time teacher with a background in journalism.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.280]   And the type of writing he's doing is describing history for a walking tour.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.240]   I'm sure he's perfectly capable of doing that.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.680]   His craft is where it needs to be.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.000]   If he was a 22-year-old college student who has never really written professional before,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.240]   okay, you got to get some training to get above that amateur bar.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   He's already well above that amateur bar and the writing he's doing is not, the value in
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   what he's doing is not in the quality of the writing.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.400]   It just has to be non-amateur writing.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.880]   I bet he can already do that.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   Good point.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   All right.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   What do we got next?
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880]   All right.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.520]   Next question's from Ruby, a 35-year-old banker from London.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.400]   I'm taking a few weeks off to recover from burnout due to a period where my responsibilities
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   kept increasing.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.480]   What would you recommend to do to make the most of my time away from work?
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.280]   So Ruby, the productivity perspective here is that if all you do during your time off
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.160]   is recharge and then just go back into this environment where you were before, give it
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.640]   six months, you'll be back in the same place.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.400]   What is important here, this is what I would do with my time off, is figure out what is
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:30.560]   the productivity framework I'm going to put in place so that I have clarity into all of
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.600]   the obligations entering my world.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.360]   None of it is being held only in my mind.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   I am configuring.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.400]   I can see what it is, what type of work do I have at different parts.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.200]   This is the traditional facing the productivity dragon.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.380]   And then I control my time on different timescales.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.380]   Here's what I'm doing today.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.380]   Here's what I'm doing this week.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.600]   Here's how these projects fit.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.080]   Now here's the goal here.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.680]   Not that with this productivity framework, you can optimize your time enough that the
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.040]   workload that burnt you out before you can now handle.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.400]   That's not the goal.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.280]   The goal instead is clarity.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.320]   Clarity about what's on your plate.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.680]   Clarity about what is reasonable to be on your plate.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.660]   Clarity about proposing this, this and this makes sense, this, this and this is too much.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.440]   The productivity system, a good productivity system can give you the confidence you need
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.200]   to advocate for yourself.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.720]   Now again, this I think is one of the, one of the insidious side effects of rejecting
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   productivity because you associate it with this optimization over our culture is that
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.680]   ironically it is exactly what your employer wants you to do.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   We think about it.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.080]   Oh no, the productivity is somehow part of this base superstructure sort of early 20th
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.440]   century Marxist approach of, of trying to exploit more labor from the, from the, the,
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.800]   the proletariat or something like this.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   Right?
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.280]   That's the old grad school, blah, blah, blah approach to it.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.360]   Actually knowing what you're doing, knowing what's on your plate, having a extreme clarity
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.960]   about exactly your workplace, seeing the matrix of the obligations being thrown at you with
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.400]   clarity.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.080]   That's actually what in a lot of these overwhelmed situations, your employer wouldn't want, because
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.620]   it means you can come back and say, I know this is crazy.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.760]   We need to cut this in half.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.800]   Let me tell you why.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.720]   You know, I have my arms around everything and I'm very careful.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.080]   I run my schedule very carefully and I do very good work.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.360]   This is 50% too much.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.400]   And I have confidence in that conviction.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   If you instead fall back into haphazard busyness because you're trying to reject the, the hustle
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.120]   culture, et cetera, you are at the mercy of these employers.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.200]   It's just all stuff.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   We're all busy.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   You got a bunch of stuff.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   Why aren't you doing work?
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   Why are you complaining?
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.840]   You're either going to burn yourself out again and again, or give them excuse to fire you.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   So productivity can actually be what you need to prevent and push back against overload.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   Right?
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.880]   So this is, again, the whole autonomy frame for productivity is having your arms around
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.800]   your obligations is what allows you to do so many different things.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.960]   And this is one of the things you can do is it allows you to stand up, allows you to stand
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.640]   up and say with a clear voice and conviction enough.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.200]   This is too much.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.840]   I know it's too much.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   You know that.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.760]   I know that now this is my, this is what's reasonable and this is what I'm going to do.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.240]   And when people know that you have your act together, when it comes to these sort of productivity
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.320]   systems, it's much harder for them to push back against that.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.280]   So that's what I would say, rest and recharge, but also get your systems fired up so that
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.480]   when you come back, you're no longer at the mercy of like whatever junk your employer
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.040]   is just throwing at you and hoping you won't notice that it's completely unreasonable.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.400]   I like what you said at the end of the deep dive to about having options.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.760]   Productivity is about that's the autonomy frame.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.320]   If you don't have control over all the different obligations orbiting you in your professional
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:02.440]   life, you are at the mercy of whim, your boss's mood, your personality, what you can get away
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.720]   with and basically will probably just be stressed out.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.440]   I mean, or you could be okay.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.800]   Like maybe you just whatever, become kind of misanthropic and, and resentful and people
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.920]   want to deal with it and you kind of find a way to make it work, but it's all just,
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.200]   you're drifting towards some sort of steady state.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.880]   There's probably going to be a non-optimal equilibrium, but when you know everything
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   that's going on, you can stand back and say this, this, and this is the problem.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.320]   And if I move this, I can't do those.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.720]   I got to take this off my plate and no, no, no, of course, no, of course, no, of course,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   no.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   Yes.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   I'll do this.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   And it just makes all the difference.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.800]   You can do so much if you have a good productivity system and you can't do almost anything without
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   it.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.160]   So it's not like I'm burnt out or I'm, you know, quitting the workforce and hoping that
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.600]   people subscribe to my sub stack.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.720]   There's got to be something in between those two.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   All right.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   Let's keep rolling.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   What do we have next?
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.000]   All right.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.920]   Next question's from Rito, 23 year old from India.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.000]   I have too many interests in my life.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.360]   I have so many choices.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.160]   It's crippling and I end up doing nothing.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.440]   My question is how do I learn to prioritize?
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.160]   So Rito, I included this question because it helps show that the productivity perspective
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.180]   is also relevant to your life outside of work.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.360]   It's also relevant to your leisure life.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.000]   So haphazard busyness can cripple you like it's happening here in your leisure life in
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.440]   the same way that it can in your professional life, especially like Rito, you're young,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.020]   you're 23 years old, you have all this time and all this potential.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.280]   And there's so many different things you can do that you bounce from one thing to another
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.120]   and nothing's making progress.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.400]   Your brain will eventually stop trying to generate motivation.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.160]   I've written about this before, Rito, what's really happening here, if you want my opinion,
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.980]   is that our brain is very good at evaluating potential plans.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.520]   Is this objective worth it?
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.400]   And do I have reason to believe this plan is going to work?
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.560]   Our brain asks and answers those two questions all the time.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.800]   We're very good at that.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.160]   This is something that is bred into our paleolithic path.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.280]   Those mechanisms, when it doesn't trust you really know what you're doing, when it doesn't
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.220]   trust that there's a plan here that makes sense, that's going to lead to some sort of
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.840]   mastery or a highly fulfilling outcome.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.900]   It says, nope.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.160]   And what does it feel like when your plan evaluation apparatus in your brain says, no,
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.500]   it feels like procrastination.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.520]   You can't summon motivation because there is a system in our brain that generates the
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.200]   feelings of motivation towards action and has to believe what you're doing.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.560]   So if your leisure life is crippled with or ridden with haphazard busyness, it's like,
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.320]   I'm not going to just start this whatever by a video camera to become the next Martin
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.640]   Scorsese, because you don't know what you're doing here.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   There's no plan here.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.440]   This is one of like 15 different things you have.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.640]   That is why you have this feeling of I can't do anything.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   I feel crippled.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   It's because it's too haphazard.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   It's too busy.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.680]   So you can bring a productivity framework into your leisure life to get your arms around
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.880]   this, to start to be selective, to start to be intentional about what you spend your time
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.240]   on.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.000]   And in doing so, you're going to end up in a much better place.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.560]   So let me give you a particular suggestion here, just to plant a seed.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.720]   So one way you might structure more intentionally your life outside of work would be a four
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   part focus.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.960]   I've talked about this before.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.360]   Three routines and one project in one time.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.820]   So the three routines that just figure out how to have going in the background would
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.440]   probably be some sort of fitness health routine.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.360]   This is eating and exercise.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.520]   This is foundational.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.240]   Let's get that going background, some sort of reading routine.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.800]   I'm reading on a regular basis.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.460]   I'm moving away from just distraction.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.960]   My mind is learning how to actually remain focused on complex thoughts.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.640]   You're going to develop as a human being.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.200]   You're going to develop as a, as a thinker.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.820]   We did a podcast episode a few weeks ago on how to become a reader was called the joys
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   of the reading life.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.960]   It's probably like two 38.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Episode two 38.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.080]   You can watch that.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.600]   Your third routine I would say to put in place foundationally is some sort of community routine.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.280]   These things you do on a regular basis that keep you connected and serving your friends,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.640]   your family, other people in the communities that you're involved with.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.720]   Get background routines for those three things going.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   That's just foundational.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.960]   You can tweak those, but you should always on a regular basis.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.560]   Those things are just woven into the fabric of your life.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   Okay.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.040]   And then one major project.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.760]   And then do that major project till you get to a great milestone that you can swap in
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.520]   another major project.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.840]   So just one major project at a time, spend six months on it, spend a year on it.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   I don't really care.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   You're young.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   You're 23.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.080]   You have more time than you think.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.600]   So this is just one particular suggestions of how you might establish a more intentional
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.960]   approach to your leisure life, but, but having routines for the things that are foundational
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.760]   to a life well live and then pursuing one thing at a time until a good point, giving
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.360]   that your full attention that for example, works really well.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.180]   And it's the type of thing that you're not going to get to until you get more intentional
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:57.820]   about your time.
