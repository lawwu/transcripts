[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai,
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.080]   and I just want to say thank you to the 2,000 plus of you
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.200]   for pre-ordering a hard copy of my book,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.320]   "Buy This, Not That, How to Spend Your Way
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.560]   "to Wealth and Freedom."
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.760]   I truly believe my book will be the best
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.680]   or one of the best personal finance books out there.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.120]   I spent two years writing, editing, rewriting the book
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.080]   over and over again to make it as applicable as possible
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.400]   and to help as many people as possible
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.040]   get their finances right.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.520]   In addition, over 90 million readers
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.880]   have come to Financial Samurai
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   since I started the site in 2009.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.920]   And as a result, I've heard many, many different perspectives
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.600]   that have really elucidated my blind spots
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.680]   and perhaps many of yours as well.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.720]   I truly believe the best way to learn
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.240]   is to look at different perspectives,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.200]   to listen to other people,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.000]   and then build upon some of the positives
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.960]   from their viewpoints into your own
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.760]   so you can make better choices going forward.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   It's hard to believe, but I've spent over 30 years
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.520]   working in finance, studying finance,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.560]   and writing about finance.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920]   So in essence, finance is in my blood
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   and this is the book I've always wanted to write
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.920]   to help readers everywhere
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.360]   live better lives on their terms.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.200]   Money is too important to be left up to pontification.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.400]   As a result, everything I've written in the book
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.840]   is based on firsthand experience.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.280]   This way, I can share with you the good and the bad
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.000]   to help you make better decisions.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.720]   The secret to stop saying,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.160]   "Well, if I knew then what I know now,"
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.560]   is to simply learn from someone
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.200]   who has been through what you will go through
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   or what you may go through.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.640]   Preparation is so important
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.400]   if you wanna get your finances right
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.480]   and if you wanna get your life right.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   Here's the thing.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.120]   Once you get your money right,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.420]   you can start better focusing on things
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.120]   that really matter to you.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.840]   After all, money is only a means to an end.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.480]   And for those of you who treat money as the end all be all,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.840]   I hope my book will help change your philosophy.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.640]   Once you achieve a certain level of financial independence
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.360]   where your passive income covers your living expenses,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.520]   the world really opens up.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.640]   I believe the ultimate goal
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.480]   is to move money into the background
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   so you can stop obsessing over it,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.840]   worrying about it, fretting over it,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.820]   and start focusing on doing the things that matter.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.240]   I show you how in the first half of my book
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.480]   with actionable advice under a logical framework.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.080]   I help you move forward with confidence.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.600]   And let's talk about the word confidence for a bit.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Some of us have more confidence
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.080]   and more courage than others.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.040]   And that's fine.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.720]   The more education you have,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.920]   the more knowledge you have,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.720]   and the more experience you have,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.840]   the more confident and courageous you will be.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.240]   So this is one of the reasons why
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   Buy This, Not That is so important.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.160]   Because after reading the book,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.680]   I truly believe your confidence and courage will go up
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   so that you can approach life in a more fulfilling way.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.120]   In the second half of my book,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.920]   I talk about many of life's biggest dilemmas
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.080]   and how to approach them
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.440]   using my 70/30 decision-making framework.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.180]   In other words, if you believe there's a 70% probability
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.880]   or greater you will make the correct decision, go for it.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.360]   At the same time, have the awareness of knowing
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.680]   you may get things wrong 30% of the time.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.720]   Unless the outcome is death or financial ruin,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   you'll be able to learn from your mistakes,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.200]   recover, and make better choices over time.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.640]   And if you've been with Financial Samar for a while,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.080]   you have heard many of my failures and many of my mistakes.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.600]   After every single failure, it stings, it hurts.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.480]   Why did they reject me?
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.920]   What's wrong with me?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.600]   But I turn it around to say,
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.660]   well, the reason why they rejected me
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.880]   was because I was insufficient in these areas.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.400]   Let me improve upon them.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.040]   The reason why they said no
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.280]   was because I didn't have the proper framework
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.360]   or the idea or the charisma or the courage.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.760]   Whatever the rejection may be, we can learn from them
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.440]   because rejection and failure are the best teachers.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.640]   And this is what I've incorporated in "By This, Not That."
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.300]   One of my core messages is for readers
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.800]   to think in probabilities, not absolutes.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   If you think in absolutes,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.440]   you will likely miss out on a lot of great opportunities
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.960]   because you'll feel you need 100% certainty
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.700]   before moving forward.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.340]   Think back to the time, let's say,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.200]   maybe you were in high school,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.880]   or maybe it's even middle school.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.160]   You liked that girl or that boy, but you weren't 100% sure.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.340]   Therefore, you didn't ask them out.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.960]   And then 10 years later, you run into them on the street,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.440]   and then you just confess your love.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.280]   Who cares?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.240]   You're an adult now, right?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.400]   You don't have any fear.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.640]   And then they suddenly tell you, you know what?
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.600]   I really liked you too.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.920]   I really liked you.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.640]   Why didn't you ask me out?
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.040]   Both parties were stuck with uncertainty.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.120]   So I say, 70% chance or greater, just go for it.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.400]   With the expectation, you'll be rejected.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   You'll be wrong 30% of the time.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.240]   But who cares?
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.200]   Because you'll learn from it.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.640]   And every single time you get rejected,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.840]   you gain a little bit more courage.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.520]   With my 70/30 decision-making framework,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   I tackle some of these dilemmas.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.120]   For example, pay for private school or public school,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.200]   join a startup or work for an established company,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.600]   start a lifestyle business or go for the grand slam,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   job hop or stay a loyal soldier, live
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.200]   in an expensive coastal city or move to a low-cost area,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.640]   invest in real estate or stocks, whether you should
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.960]   marry or just cohabitate.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.360]   Should you marry for love or marry for money?
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.800]   Should you have children early or late?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.320]   Should you seek fame to boost your wealth or stay low-key
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   and peaceful?
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.840]   And so many more topics that you and your friends
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.440]   can talk about, discuss over a drink or a meal,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.800]   and argue your own viewpoint and discuss mine as well.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.480]   Again, money is just one part of the equation.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   It's how we use our money to make better choices that
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.680]   matters most.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   If you've read Financial Samurai or listened to this podcast
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.760]   over the years, you'll notice that I don't incessantly
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.720]   talk about financial independence
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.520]   or early retirement.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.200]   And the reason is, is because I'm busy living my life,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.880]   even though financial independence is what I achieved
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.280]   back in 2012 when I was 34.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.840]   It was a simple life back then, and it's a little bit more
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.040]   complicated now because I'm a father of two young children.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.520]   So I'm spending a lot of time taking care of them,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.560]   trying to help them with their emotional and physical
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.000]   development, and just trying to be present.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.800]   And so as a result, I'll talk about fatherhood.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.160]   And maybe another day, I'll talk about the Federal Reserve
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.320]   hiking rates by 50 basis points.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.880]   Whatever the case may be, life goes on after you've
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.840]   achieved financial independence.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.080]   And so it's all about the journey, the journey to
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   financial independence and post financial independence,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   and what you're using your money to do with your life.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.680]   Now, obviously, the more money you have, the more options
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.440]   you have, and that's up to all of us.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.360]   And this is why I've decided to dedicate a good portion of
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.680]   the book by trying to figure out what are the real life
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.900]   scenarios that we'll face and how money is involved in
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.280]   these scenarios.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.480]   Now, let me share five reasons why I wrote "Buy This, Not
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.000]   That," and in the end, I'll also share some bonus gifts
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.820]   that I'll provide for you if you order more than one copy.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.340]   So one, the book had to be written.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.680]   One of the reasons why I started Financial Samurai in
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.320]   2009 is because I noticed there weren't any personal
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.980]   finance bloggers with finance backgrounds.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.020]   It was strange to me.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.040]   So therefore, I thought, well, it'd be a good idea to fill
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.720]   this obvious hole.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.480]   I thought about money a little bit differently, and I wanted
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.440]   to bring my expertise and perspectives to the world.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.120]   When I was approached by portfolio Penguin Random House
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.720]   with the book idea, I noticed there also weren't many
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.440]   nonfiction finance books that were written by people with
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.840]   finance backgrounds.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.960]   I thought it was really strange, so I said, well, I
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.400]   figured I might as well fill the hole again.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.760]   After being able to escape corporate America at 34 and
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.880]   live the life I've wanted and I want for the past 10 years, I
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.840]   just had to write a book that could help people potentially
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.560]   do something similar.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.520]   In my mind, once you see how something is done, it's much
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.880]   easier to believe a similar path is possible for you.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.640]   It's kind of like when Roger Bannister broke the four
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.520]   minute mile in 1954 at the age of 25.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.480]   Before then, nobody thought breaking the four minute mile
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   was possible.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.720]   But after he did so, many other runners followed suit.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.040]   All right, the second reason why I wrote Buy This, Not
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.920]   That, there's a whole world of consumers out there who love
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.240]   to read books and not blogs.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.200]   Therefore, it was only logical to write Buy This, Not That to
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.800]   try to reach them.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Before you start writing a book, you want to think about
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.760]   impact and how it will help others.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.080]   So in my mind, creating maximum impact in an affordable
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.960]   way is important.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.200]   I could create $2,000 plus e-courses like some of my
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   peers do, and I would probably make a lot of money.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.400]   However, I felt packing in all the information in a book that
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.680]   cost $27 or less was a more accessible solution.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.440]   One of the reasons why I continue to write three times
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.840]   a week on Financial Samurai plus a weekly newsletter is
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.000]   because I want to write for free and help as many people
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.080]   as possible think about different perspectives, get
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.640]   their finances right, feel more confident in
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.720]   living their lives.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.480]   I know that once I started getting my finances right,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.560]   whether it's through investing, budgeting, saving,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.640]   asset allocation, I could move forward more.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.200]   I could buy a house.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.160]   I could feel more confident starting a family.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.760]   All these things matter.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   And if it's free or if it's low cost, it
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.360]   can help more people.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   If you look at the average net worth, the average median
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.200]   household income, I believe the world needs more financial
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.440]   education.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.160]   A personal finance course should be mandatory in high
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.640]   school or college.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.440]   But it is curiously still not.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.840]   I live in this bubble where I studied economics in college,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.320]   got my MBA, worked in investment banking for 13 years,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.360]   and I've written over 2,500 personal finance articles
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.840]   since 2009.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   I'm like hooked.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   This is just a part of me.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.520]   And if I don't write for a couple days, I start getting a
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   little bit jittery.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.520]   Now, the things that seem obvious to me or others with
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.760]   finance backgrounds don't seem as obvious to those without
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.720]   financial backgrounds.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.840]   Therefore, my goal is to bring more financial education to
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   those who seek to grow their wealth in a
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.560]   risk-appropriate way.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.760]   And I think it's our duty to share what we know.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.600]   Sharing is how we can all learn, and sharing is about
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   giving back.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.560]   One of the things I noticed after I reached 40--
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.760]   I'm 45 now--
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.840]   is that the desire to share the knowledge grows.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.480]   And I think one of the reasons why is because your skill set
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.040]   actually slowly begins to diminish from
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.960]   your 20s and 30s.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.240]   Think about as an athlete.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.600]   The reason why a lot of tennis players retire in their 30s is
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.080]   because they just can't compete anymore.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   And the mind, thankfully, lasts a much longer time.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.880]   But you want to preserve that knowledge.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   And the more you share, actually, the better you feel,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   because you know that other people are being helped.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.800]   All right, the third reason why I decided to write the
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.680]   book--
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.840]   I want to narrow the growing inequality gap.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.880]   Since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.400]   rich have gotten extraordinarily rich
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.840]   compared to the middle class.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.800]   Meanwhile, the top 0.1% have blown past the top 1% as well.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.560]   In the book, I want to bring their secrets and their ways
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.160]   of investing and thinking to the public in order to help
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.440]   more people build wealth.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.120]   And while I was writing the book, I also had an epiphany
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.920]   as to why so many personal finance authors write mainly
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.760]   only about saving money, budgeting, and index funds--
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.440]   all very important topics, but they've been talked about over
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.320]   and over again.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.840]   And I just didn't understand why not write more interesting
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.680]   and potentially lucrative topics.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.120]   After all, you can only save so much, but income and
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.120]   investment returns are unlimited.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.520]   So after over a year of writing and rewriting my book, I
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.200]   finally understood why.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Without a finance background, writing about anything else is
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.120]   way more difficult.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.480]   And it was very difficult for me to try to distill these
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   ideas and concepts that I've been practicing and that I
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.760]   have learned in finance to be understandable and
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.200]   helpful to readers.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.360]   So my hope is that with the knowledge you'll gain from
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.640]   reading Buy This, Not That, you will build way more wealth
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.880]   in your lifetime than you thought possible.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.160]   And if this happens, your standard of living will go up,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.960]   and the growing inequality gap will ultimately narrow.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.400]   Now, I can't pretend to imagine this book and Financial
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.480]   Samurai will reach the whole world.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.560]   Of course it's not.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.360]   It's just a small, small, tiny sub-segment of the internet
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.680]   and for the book-reading population.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.640]   But if you get your hands on this book, and if you read my
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.480]   writing, I am certain that you're going to build more
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.800]   wealth and have more confidence to live your life
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.120]   the way you want going forward.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.640]   All right, the fourth reason, new perspectives with more
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.360]   representation.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.600]   As an Asian person who lived in Asia for 13 years, I used to
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.200]   be part of the majority.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.440]   That's all I knew.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.960]   And then when I came to Virginia for high school and
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.360]   college at the age of 14, I became part of a minority that
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.120]   made up only 6% of the US population.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.040]   The juxtaposition was eye-opening.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.680]   I could see both sides.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.000]   And it was really, really, really interesting.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.800]   At times, it was hard to fit in for me in Virginia.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.160]   I got into fist fights.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.080]   I was suspended once and felt like I often had to battle to
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.200]   be given an equal opportunity to participate.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.120]   Although some of the experiences were really harsh,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.720]   they also gave me tremendous motivation to try harder and
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.440]   not be beholden to anyone for the rest of my life.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.040]   By high school, I clearly realized the world isn't fair
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.600]   and never will be fair.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.040]   Therefore, instead of complaining, whining, I
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.280]   accepted the way things were and focused on what I could
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.560]   control.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.880]   And I bring this fighter's mindset to the book to give you
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.400]   the motivation to push on through no matter who you are
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.000]   or how difficult your struggles.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.400]   This is my favorite Chinese proverb of all time.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.800]   If the direction is correct, sooner or later,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.280]   you will get there.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.200]   We know people are biased towards people who think, look,
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.360]   and talk like them.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.680]   It's why podcast interviewees, award winners, bestsellers,
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.240]   and families who attend elite schools tend to be quite
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.200]   homogenous.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.440]   Let's just be frank.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.760]   But that's just the way it is.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.480]   But in my mind, I thought it would be nice to change things
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.680]   up a little bit and provide new perspectives.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.080]   And maybe there will be more love and understanding
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.040]   for Asian folks in America if they read a good book
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.520]   by an Asian person who helps them.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.440]   And maybe, perhaps, a kid who seldom sees anybody
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   who looks like them will be inspired
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.920]   to write their own book or do something out of the ordinary.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.720]   I personally have this dream one day
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.520]   that my son and daughter will bring my book to show and tell
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.560]   class one day and say, this is what my daddy does.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.600]   In addition, a large percentage of every country's population
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.160]   lives in more expensive urban cities
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.360]   because historically, that's where the jobs were.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.560]   In America, about 45% of the US population
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.600]   lives on the coasts.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.080]   And high cost of living areas present some unique challenges
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.800]   which I address in the book.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.120]   With how bifurcated America is, I'm
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.800]   hoping to create an understanding
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.200]   bridge between those who live on the expensive coasts
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.880]   and those who live inland.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.680]   There's no right or wrong way.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.840]   But there are interesting and new ways
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.720]   in terms of how to live your life and build wealth.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.440]   Ultimately, we all have the same goals of supporting our country
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.640]   and doing more of what we want.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.200]   I'm convinced most conflict in this world
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.560]   is due to a lack of understanding of other people
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.040]   and their personal situations.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.880]   So let's spend more time getting to know each other
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.840]   and less time judging people for their choices.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.880]   And now to my final reason why I wrote by this, not that.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.080]   Steady your navigation through bad times.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.240]   As someone who has worked in finance since 1999,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.920]   I've gone through the euphoria and despair
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.760]   of the first dot-com bubble.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.080]   I know so many paper millionaires who lost it all.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.320]   Then I went through the investment mania of 2000
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.440]   and the devastation a few years later
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.520]   with a significant amount of capital.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.960]   I lost about 35% of my net worth in six months.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.600]   However, after each collapse, I've
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.360]   learned how to strengthen my finances
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.240]   so that no matter what happens, I'll most likely be OK.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.680]   And I want to share with you what
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.520]   I've learned to help more people survive downturns
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.280]   without too much harm.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   Reading by this, not that will help armor your finances
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.160]   and provide security for your household.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.840]   For so long, it's only been good times, right?
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.480]   Since 2009, July, when I started the site,
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.000]   that was the bottom of the market.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.600]   And it's just been up, up, up, and up.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.760]   And you may have read only perspectives
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.280]   of people who've only experienced good times
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.880]   since 2009.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.960]   So in other words, maybe people 40 and under.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.360]   This can be very, very dangerous.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.920]   Bad times will eventually come, which
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.840]   is when you'll need financial guidance the most.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.160]   And it's really hard to understand your true risk
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.880]   tolerance and how bad things can get
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.400]   if you don't go through a prolonged bear market yourself.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   Now, although many of us went through the March 2020 crash
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.720]   and it was quite violent, it was also a quick, quick rebound.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.480]   So by this, not that will help navigate you
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.200]   through stormy waters so that no matter how wretched the economy,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   you will not drown but thrive.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.240]   On my long journey, I've encountered
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.880]   many people who've gone bankrupt and who've had to start over.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.600]   And it is very, very devastating,
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.760]   especially if you have a family.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.520]   And my goal for by this, not that is to help you be OK
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.360]   and to give you that courage to live the life that you want.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.240]   Thanks so much for listening to this episode.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.000]   And thanks again if you pre-ordered a hard copy of

[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.080]   For those of you who order two or more hard copies,
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.720]   I'm going to send you a book plate just
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.400]   to fill out the form with your contact information.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.640]   For those of you who order five or more copies,
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.520]   I'll send you a couple of book plates and the latest edition
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.360]   of How to Engineer Your Layoff--
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.320]   Make a Small Fortune by Saying Goodbye.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.200]   It's in its fifth edition, and it has helped thousands
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.320]   and thousands of people leave jobs with money in their pocket.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.120]   And finally, for those of you who order 10 or more hard
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.000]   copies, I've got a special gift for you.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.120]   It'll be a signed copy by yours truly,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.480]   plus a signature stamp that only 100 of you will receive.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.720]   They're going to be numbered 1 out of 100, 2 out of 100,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.600]   and so forth.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.160]   And if you're a collector like I am--
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.600]   I've been a collector since I was a kid--
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.960]   you might really enjoy this.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.080]   I'll send it to you in a hermetically sealed plastic bag
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.680]   for you to keep as a collector's item.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.640]   And who knows?
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.840]   Maybe in 10, 20 years, it might be worth a lot more.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   Take care, everyone.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.800]   I'm having so much fun recording these episodes,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.280]   writing these posts, and pre-marketing.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.040]   Maybe I'll see some of you around the Bay Area, Honolulu,
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.280]   or New York City.
