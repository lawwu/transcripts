[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   I can absolutely see sometime over the next four quarters,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.080]   we're going to hit a zone of disillusionment
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.140]   because everybody's pigpiled in here.
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.940]   They think it's all happening now.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.440]   It's going to take a little bit longer,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.020]   just like the internet did, just like cloud did.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:28.300]   - Bill, we made it to episode two.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.340]   - We did. Aaron, I'm super excited you decided to join us.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.200]   I've known you for a while
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.540]   and I've heard other people talk about you.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.500]   And there's two things I just really love.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.100]   One, you always have an independent point of view
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.940]   and you're not afraid to state it,
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.780]   which is not true for everyone,
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.920]   especially people in the CEO slot.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.480]   But more importantly, people refer to you as an old soul.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.460]   Now, I looked that word up.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.280]   It's actually, it's not derogatory at all.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.320]   And it doesn't even mean you're old.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.660]   It means you're wise beyond your years.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.660]   Now, I know you're not 40 yet,
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.400]   so you're two decades short of me.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.900]   So I'm not calling you old,
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900]   but I do think people look up to you, respect you,
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.400]   think of you as a mentor in the valley.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.980]   And so we'd love to hear what's on your mind
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.400]   and what you're thinking about.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.240]   - I appreciate that.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.780]   I think, actually, I have more gray hair
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.280]   than either of you guys.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.580]   So I think I'm going to say--
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.980]   - That's what happens when you run a software company
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.820]   through Zerp.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.160]   - They did not tell me this when I got started.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.260]   So I wish this would have been on the label,
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.860]   but yeah, no, I'm super excited to be here.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.420]   Obviously, a ton of stuff happening
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.380]   in the industry right now,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.460]   and I'm excited to dive into whatever
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.460]   you guys wanna talk about.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.160]   - We have to kick off with software, right?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.780]   You're one of the thought leaders in the space,
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.100]   and certainly we know you well,
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.420]   and most people in Silicon Valley know you well,
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.900]   but maybe just a level set,
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.380]   quick reminder for everybody.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.700]   What does Box do?
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.400]   What inspired you to get it started,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.260]   and then how it's evolving as you guys exit Zerp?
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.100]   - (laughs) Actually, the Zerp thing,
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.540]   I know there's a lot of Zerp stuff going on,
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.720]   but we actually never really even had
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.540]   that much of a Zerp benefit.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.620]   I can certainly get into the different eras.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.860]   There was about a three-year period
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.780]   where we raised a ton of capital and we burned it,
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.560]   and we did have a little bit of a Zerp benefit,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.540]   but it was actually, on paper,
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.660]   exactly the right thing to do at that point.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.020]   I got diluted a ton in the process as a result,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.700]   but it was actually, strategically,
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.940]   the most important thing to be doing.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.180]   But history of the company, super quickly,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.020]   and what we do, so we built a platform
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.280]   that helps companies manage their most important data,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.260]   their financial documents, their marketing materials,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.320]   their contracts, their strategy content,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.540]   anything that can turn into a piece of content
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.500]   we manage and store and secure.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.060]   We have about 115,000 customers,
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.940]   70% of the Fortune 500,
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.020]   and we started the company with a really simple premise.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.420]   This was in 2004, 2005, when we got the idea.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.620]   It was right at the start
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.180]   where you could put data in the cloud.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.380]   It wasn't called the cloud then,
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.940]   and we did crazy bridge rounds and all this stuff.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.820]   I think we pitched Bill four times at that point,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.240]   handled it, got rejected, probably appropriately,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.780]   and, or maybe it was Peter Fenton,
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.300]   but we can blame it on him,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.380]   and then pivoted to the enterprise,
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.780]   and then just got super lucky,
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.780]   which was there was this hyper wave of cloud with AWS,
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.780]   iPhone, and then iPad,
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.600]   and what happened was everybody's legacy technology
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.740]   no longer worked in this era of mobility
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.140]   and cloud computing for managing their content,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.140]   and so we were able to kind of ride that wave
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.020]   where we just had a better, cheaper, faster,
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.380]   more secure platform than what else was on the market,
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.380]   and then that was sort of the period
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.380]   where we just poured the fuel on the fire
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.780]   on hiring sales reps, hiring engineers,
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.780]   building out a platform,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.580]   and then scaling up to basically where we are today,
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.340]   so 15 years of history in a couple seconds.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.820]   - One thing I'd love to talk about,
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.580]   especially with you here, Aaron, is software multiples,
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420]   and so you've lived through a lot of different
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.740]   spots on the curve,
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.180]   and I've always said that Silicon Valley
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.260]   has the crudest kind of least intelligent view of valuation.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.380]   They always rush to price to revenue
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.700]   because it's easy,
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.060]   and because, quite frankly, it's easier to be optimistic,
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.140]   and then the other thing that happens in Silicon Valley,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.620]   all founders kind of tie themselves to a single number,
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.880]   so 10 times revenue or something,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.860]   and Brad has some data,
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.900]   and on the first slide,
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   I think the average multiple for a SaaS company is now six,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.020]   which is actually not that bad.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.180]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.700]   - But even to say the average is misleading
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.160]   because the dispersion is so great.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.700]   - I mean, you guys have done more content
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.580]   and thought leadership on this
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.340]   than probably any two people in the world.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.980]   Not all software companies are created equal.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.060]   Not all technology companies are created equal.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.900]   I think we clearly have been through a period,
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.460]   probably due to just the influx of capital,
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.780]   maybe this is the Zerp element, Brad,
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.940]   that you're kind of referring to,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.700]   is if you're one click or two clicks
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.620]   removed from Sand Hill Road,
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.540]   and Sand Hill's equally to probably blame at certain points,
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.660]   you're sort of like, oh, tech-enabled everything
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.460]   should all get a six or 10x revenue multiple
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.020]   when the underlying economics of this business
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.180]   could be literally 100x difference.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.340]   You could have a five or 10% margin company
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.740]   versus a 90% margin, 95% margin company,
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.860]   and, but yet the outside capital inflow
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.940]   is treating those as exactly the same revenue multiple,
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.380]   which is obviously diabolically crazy.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.940]   Our own journey has been a little bit really simple
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.140]   because we've always sort of traded
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.660]   somewhere between four and 8x.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.260]   We've never had the crazy high multiple.
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.700]   We haven't also been totally sort of forgotten about
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.540]   at any point, and I think that's a result of,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.040]   we've always had basically between 70 and 80% gross margin,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.160]   somewhere in the 100 to 120% net retention rate.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.680]   And so the economics kind of always work out that,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.760]   okay, you kind of know the underlying contours
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.120]   of the business model, but yeah, I mean,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.160]   I think we've been for too long treated all software
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.480]   and all technology indiscriminately as sort of,
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.280]   like it should be an 80% gross margin company
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.640]   with a triple-digit net retention rate,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.800]   and that's just not the case.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.820]   So, I mean, I kind of almost flip it back to you guys
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.040]   on like, how do you think, do we come back
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.160]   to forgetting about the differences,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.400]   or is this now a much more sort of normal environment
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.240]   that sustains?
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.040]   - I think that really is the critical question.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.280]   We have a few more charts here.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.800]   To your point, if you pull up this next chart,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.960]   the blue line represents the multiple of revenue.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.160]   Here, we are actually looking at this growth adjusted,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.240]   and you can see that we had this major spike
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.680]   during the period of '20 and '21, right?
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.000]   So, this is normalizing for growth.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.560]   We fell all the way back down to this 10-year average,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.940]   and now we're above it again on a growth-adjusted basis.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.700]   If you go to the next slide, we said, okay,
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.400]   let's look at it from a free cashflow
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.800]   multiple perspective, Aaron, and what you've seen here
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.520]   is that a lot of companies like Box have said
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.960]   during this period of '20, '21, whoa,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.080]   we gotta focus on profitability, not so much on growth,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.500]   because we may not raise that next round of financing.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.320]   So, everybody got a lot more profitable.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   So, on a free cashflow basis, you know,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.800]   the multiples are actually trending
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.920]   right around that 10-year average.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.080]   You see this next slide,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.720]   which I think points out really well,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.880]   this is the median free cashflow margin
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.960]   of the same basket of software companies.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.520]   So, you see these companies were, you know, remember,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.680]   you remember back in 2015, it's hard to raise capital
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.980]   if you were a software company.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.360]   You know, certainly in '13 and '14, it was.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.120]   So, everybody had to fund themselves.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.240]   Then we entered this period again, you know,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.980]   around Zerp where everybody said, oh, I guess it's just
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.600]   growth at all costs and who cares about profitability?
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.720]   And now we're seeing the return to that.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.600]   But the final chart, at least on this bit
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.720]   that I thought would be interesting, you know,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.360]   everybody talks about the rule of 40.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.160]   So, this is a dispersion, this is a scatterplot
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.720]   just of all the software companies, you know,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.040]   against that rule of 40, you know,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.440]   and you see where, you know, Box, you know,
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.200]   stands on that currently, you know, like, you know,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.520]   just to calibrate, you have one of the highest
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.680]   free cashflow margins, I think, you know,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.640]   in the software universe, around 29%,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.800]   but currently are kind of that mid single digit growth rate.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.280]   And I think this is the point that Bill talks about
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.800]   that I'm super interested in, because you have to deal
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.240]   with the animal instincts of the market.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.200]   And there's certain phases of the market
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   where they're valuing growth really highly
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.040]   and certain phases of the market
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.760]   where they're valuing profitability really highly.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.080]   It sounds like you just kind of, you know,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.840]   ignored Zerp a bit, didn't get caught up in this,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.560]   but when you looked around, right,
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   Frank Slootman said to me, probably in 2021,
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.320]   most software companies in Silicon Valley are walking dead
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.280]   and they don't even know it, right?
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.960]   When you looked around in 20 and 21 and look around today,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.840]   how do you think your fellow CEOs and founders
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.920]   are balancing that profitability versus growth trade-off?
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.680]   - A lot to unpack here.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.800]   So, first of all, I mean, empirically,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.400]   the data is showing that most public company CEOs
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.680]   have dealt with this relatively well.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.400]   They have sort of responded to the crisis
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.120]   and, you know, Brad, especially, obviously,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.760]   you put out great content that I think has catalyzed
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.720]   that across a number of CEOs as well.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.280]   And I think there's been a clear wake-up call to,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.800]   you know, let's just say, you know,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.520]   my contemporary group of, you know,
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.400]   2010 onward SaaS companies where, you know,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.480]   we benefited from relatively cheap capital,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.360]   you know, relatively high valuations.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.560]   We could use that capital to, again, grow at all costs.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.600]   I would, you know, if I represent, you know,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.200]   probably many of the names on this group,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.240]   I think that was the exactly right economic decision
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.080]   at the time.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.040]   There was sort of a market share war.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.480]   You were acquiring customers that maybe had a,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.280]   sort of a five or 10-year, you know,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.760]   kind of lifetime value curve associated with them,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.160]   maybe even more.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.600]   And so, of course, you want to gobble up
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.200]   as much market share as humanly possible.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.760]   There's a lot of stickiness to the platform.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.480]   There's some kind of network effects
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.400]   in some of these enterprise software players.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.680]   - And that's what you were referring to earlier, Aaron,
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.120]   when you said doing the right thing at the time.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.080]   - Yeah, I think that, I just wish I could have negotiated
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.040]   maybe slightly better terms, you know,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.560]   from a dilution standpoint, but, you know,
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.800]   there's little I would have done dramatically different
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.720]   in terms of putting our foot on the gas.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.680]   - If you could go back, yeah.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.960]   - Yeah, like, with the perfect benefit of hindsight,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.240]   there's some things in maybe demand gen
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.320]   that were unprofitable that we'd like to have not done.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.040]   There are some decisions, like, you know,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.600]   it just, to all the founders out there,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.240]   like, there are lots of little things,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.400]   and feel free to call me, like, you can just,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.600]   you can actually have better terms of your billings
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.880]   with customers that brings in more cash flow up front,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.480]   which means you raise less money.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.960]   Like, all of these very boring things
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.440]   actually just mean you can be more capital efficient
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.000]   and still grow at the same rate.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And, you know, we had a fantastic board.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.960]   They were pushing us and governing us appropriately
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.560]   on these things, but there's lots of little tiny,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.600]   you know, single decisions that can be the difference
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.680]   of an extra five or 10% dilution in some cases.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.880]   - Wow.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.920]   - And, you know, if I could go back,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.400]   I maybe would be incrementally more thoughtful
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.240]   on a bunch of those.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.080]   But the underlying element of grow at all costs,
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   get market share, you know, get to 100,000 customers
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.280]   I think was pretty important.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.160]   And I think so is true for the Slack and Okta
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.400]   and Zooms of the world.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.760]   Now, some of those names, you know, sort of,
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.840]   I just would, you know, mostly blame Wall Street.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.840]   Some of those names got, you know,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.280]   so hyper accelerated into the future on their valuations,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.720]   you know, way outside, you know,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.800]   what the market was actually gonna be able
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.400]   to actually support.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.200]   And so then that's why you have this, you know,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.720]   crazy volatility of multiples, you know,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.240]   versus either revenue or free cash flow.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.400]   And then now, obviously, and, you know,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.600]   I think companies sort of invested, you know,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.880]   maybe as a result of getting that response,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.120]   you know, from Wall Street,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.080]   and then now are obviously pulling back.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.120]   But I think that from a public company standpoint,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.080]   I think the message is clear.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.160]   Everybody understands.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.320]   I think the private market's
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   probably still a little bit different
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.360]   'cause you can do this under the covers.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.320]   You don't have, you're not gonna get judged
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.880]   on a quarterly basis on, you know,
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.560]   how much have you reduced your expenses.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.160]   And, you know, there's probably less risk
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.480]   of getting a letter from Brad, you know,
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.240]   in those kinds of environments.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.040]   - That is a huge risk these days.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.720]   - Come on, come on, come on.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.400]   - But ultimately, so I think what we, you know,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.120]   have is probably, you know, dozens,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.760]   maybe hundreds of companies where they do have,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.840]   they probably could not file an S-1 today,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.600]   you know, with their current economics,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.560]   but they might actually be able
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.600]   to either grow into their numbers,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.880]   or they can do some of these changes behind the scenes,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.320]   and then ultimately have a bit more of a, you know,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.560]   pristine set of financials
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.160]   when they finally go public.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.680]   So I think we've been afforded the amount of time,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.200]   partly because of the AI wave, you know,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   partly because of some kind of, you know,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.400]   soft landing in the economy where like,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.080]   there's gonna be a lot more successful outcomes here
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   than I think we would have probably thought
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.880]   a year or two ago.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.240]   - Hey, Aaron, a quick question for you.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.040]   Obviously, there are a lot of software companies
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.640]   in the Valley.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.000]   Based on what you've been through,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   if you were advising them on what metrics matter most,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.480]   what's at the top of the list
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.280]   for them to pay attention to internally?
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.000]   - There's probably a few that are just like literally
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.680]   the underlying business model economics.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   Like I'm a big believer in gross margin.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.640]   Your gross margin will ultimately determine
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.080]   your operating margin.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.560]   There's almost no way that you can kind of make those two,
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   you know, kind of get out of sync.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.240]   And so if you're subsidizing something,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.560]   or, you know, or in just such a commodity business,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.160]   and you're, you know, 40, 50, 60% gross margin,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.640]   like there's just like no way
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.760]   you're gonna have an operating margin
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.200]   that looks like a software company.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.640]   Understanding your gross margin,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.880]   managing to gross margin, I think is super important.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.000]   You know, all forms of LTV CAC are probably good.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.280]   I don't know what the latest, you know,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.800]   everybody, every two years is a new term
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   in the industry that is used.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.320]   But like something that just shows
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.880]   that you can acquire a customer profitably,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.960]   and whether the payback is a year or two years
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.400]   or three years, almost doesn't matter
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.080]   as much as do you, you know, ultimately generate
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.240]   a long-term, you know, sticky customer.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.920]   I think cashflow is super important.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.560]   I've definitely like, I've gotten religion on cashflow.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.840]   And I think companies getting the cashflow sooner
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.480]   is a really good move.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.200]   I think it pushes the business to be super focused.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.960]   There was a lot of, again, kind of sloppiness
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.480]   around the edges that we had in our hyper growth years
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.600]   that if we maybe had had cashflow
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.800]   as a more top of mind metric,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.520]   we probably could have executed the same results,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.680]   but around the margin, we would have been, you know,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.000]   just doubling down the things that were working,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.720]   the incremental international region
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.400]   that was sort of like, you know, we were, you know,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.440]   just betting on we probably would have waited to invest in.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.520]   And then ultimately again, you know,
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.000]   burn less cash, gotten to the same point.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.720]   So I think cashflow is, you know,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.240]   I definitely encourage founders to raise less
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.000]   than I would have five or 10 years ago
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.600]   and focus more on, you know,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.040]   self-sustaining, you know, business models.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.360]   - The comment you made about earlier
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.800]   about managing your cashflow,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.240]   and I presume the same,
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.400]   you're meaning the same thing on gross margin management.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.840]   I've just found very few companies in the Valley
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.880]   pay attention to this.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.920]   Collections is another one that's in this area.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.040]   So, you know, a company will be at 70, 80 million
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.280]   and they don't have any good processes around collections.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.760]   And so their DSOs are just slipping out.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.320]   They could be way sooner
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.960]   and they're just not doing the work.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.400]   - I mean, they're like,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.120]   you guys should rally to get collections people
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.520]   to get paid way more or something.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.680]   So like, just, there are some of these functions
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.560]   that are so high leverage that if you just nail it,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.280]   you know, the deal desk legal team
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.640]   who's negotiating the contract terms.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.880]   I mean, these things are like,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.800]   they literally are trajectory defining in your cashflow.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.840]   - Earlier in the podcast,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.600]   you mentioned net dollar a couple of times in a row.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.680]   How important is that?
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.800]   - I think incredibly important.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.000]   You can make, you know, any business model work
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.160]   if it's 90 or 100 or 110,
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.680]   but like, there's no question that if you can be,
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.640]   you know, in our best years, you know,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.600]   in the hyper growth year, we're 130, 140, 150.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.760]   That comes down at some point.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.840]   And, but, but, you know, anything, I mean, just,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.240]   I mean, you guys have all the math on this,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.360]   but just like as high of a number as possible, so.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.040]   - You know, one of the things you said earlier,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.840]   I mean, there's no doubt Silicon Valley has contributed,
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.040]   I think, to the confusion here, right?
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.760]   And one of the things that, you know,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.680]   the rules of thumb that we, we've talked about everybody--
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   - Wait, who are you blaming?
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.720]   - No, I'm saying the investors have contributed, right?
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.560]   - VC.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.120]   - And at the end of the day, you know,
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.240]   like Bill has this aphorism that, you know,
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.200]   venture capital ultimately follows the public markets,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.320]   right, and founders follow venture capital.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.560]   And the reality is that part of the reason Bill and I,
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.080]   I think, are such advocates for getting
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.920]   into the public market sooner as a founder,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.160]   whether, you know, like Benioff did and Bezos did
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.440]   and so many others,
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.480]   is because it exacts a bit of a discipline.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.440]   But Bessemer came out with an analysis last week.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.360]   We have a chart on this I want to pull up
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.120]   called Rule of X, right?
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.600]   And I would love to see us get rid of Rule of 40
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.480]   and start talking about Rule of X,
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.200]   because what Rule of X does is it acknowledges something
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.880]   that all investors know to be true,
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.680]   which is growth and margin is not treated equal, right?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.920]   And so, you know, for everybody, you know,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.160]   who's may not be as familiar with Rule of 40,
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.120]   it's this idea that if you have a 20% free cashflow margin
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.800]   and a 20% growth rate,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.040]   then that you're at a Rule of 40, right?
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.520]   And I think in the case of Box, Aaron, you know,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.840]   if you take your, let's call it 20, 30% free cashflow margin
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.520]   and, you know, and 5% growth rate, even, you know,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.360]   that would be a, you know, a 35%, you know,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.320]   35 on the Rule of 40.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.600]   What this chart shows is that, you know, again,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.080]   during the ZURP period, right,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.400]   growth was a huge multiplier.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.160]   Like that's all people cared about.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.840]   But if you look at it over time,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.120]   the average has been two to three.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.840]   And I asked my team to actually plot the regression
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.600]   on this now, just so I could see
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.880]   what today are we valuing the most?
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.400]   And that's this next chart,
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.880]   which basically shows growth is being valued
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.120]   at about three times, right?
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.200]   In the Rule of 40 calculation, you know,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.280]   what margin is being valued at.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.400]   So I think one of the things I would like to see change
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.840]   in the nomenclature from the investment community
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.200]   in Silicon Valley is that we get over this enslavement
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.080]   to Rule of 40.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.480]   At the end of the day, you said it.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.200]   For a public market investor, when I look at Snowflake,
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.560]   or I look at Palo Alto Networks, or I look at Azure,
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.640]   I'm looking at what their free cash flow
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.760]   is going to be in 2025.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.400]   I'm applying a multiple to that,
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.200]   and I'm discounting back to where we are today.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.680]   Whether you're Rule of 40 or a multiple of revenue,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.600]   those are shorthands for getting
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.200]   at the multiple of free cash flow.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.120]   And so I'm just curious, you know, does this make,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.720]   you know, when you see this Rule of X,
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.240]   I assume it's instinctive to you that you get,
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.720]   you know, how this changes over time.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.160]   - Yeah, I mean, A, 100%, B, I would love to move on
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.840]   from this sort of, you know, random combination
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.320]   of two metrics that doesn't tell you a full story.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.640]   I guess the question would be, you know,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.520]   in this model, if you have a 40% growth company
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.240]   at exactly 0%, or whatever, it doesn't have to be 40,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   but like, but 0% cash flow, and whatever the growth rate is,
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.320]   how do you use your judgment to decide
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.760]   when will that company be able
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.360]   to actually produce the cash flow,
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.400]   and do the underlying economics, you know,
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.600]   sort of support that?
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.560]   And so then you don't have sort of these money pit,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.520]   you know, burning companies getting valued
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.600]   in the same way as a snowflake, let's say,
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.720]   or a workday or whatever, who like,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.320]   you kind of deeply understand it's going to be
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.400]   a 30 or 40% margin company at some kind of point
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.240]   in the future.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.120]   So you have to have some way to kind of normalize for that,
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.280]   because again, not all growth, you know,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.760]   rates are created equal as well.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.400]   And I don't exactly know how you do that
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.800]   other than just individual company analysis
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.040]   to just think through, like,
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.480]   what are the pricing pressure dynamics
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.560]   in this industry going to be?
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.920]   You know, what part of this particular product
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.040]   gets commoditized, where is there going to be,
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.960]   you know, long standing, you know, kind of moat,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.560]   or, you know, for lack of a better term.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.160]   And unfortunately, none of these models,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.240]   you know, sort of capture that
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.560]   when you look at a regression line.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.760]   So, I don't know how to solve that.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.640]   - But, I mean, literally at the peak of the madness,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.200]   people were saying, oh, you know,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.680]   you can do software investing
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.440]   just using quant analysis, right?
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.840]   Just say, you know, slap 100X on whatever the ARR is,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.480]   and, you know, this is super easy.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.000]   And, you know, I remember back in 2013,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.800]   when we invested in Snowflake,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.680]   nobody was investing in software.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.400]   And part of the view at the time was, you know,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.720]   like, we were very focused on database software,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.320]   because it was the only software
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.560]   that we had really seen scale to a billion dollars in revenue.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.720]   And a lot of this application software
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.840]   would hit a ceiling, right?
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.640]   Somewhere around 70 million, 80 million, 90 million,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.280]   and never got to the margins that were promised.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.600]   But, you know, you could look at, you know,
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.040]   Teradata or Netezza, or, you know, or IBM or Microsoft,
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.480]   the database market was always one of those markets
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.400]   that was incredibly large,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.240]   and that could get to these mature margins.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.280]   - Yeah, I mean, this obviously makes your business
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.040]   actually have differentiation in it.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.320]   But like, you know, I would see either IPO filings
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.480]   or, you know, analyst reports of,
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.280]   okay, you have a company growing at, you know,
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.640]   30, 40% or something,
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.080]   and then you'd apply the same revenue multiple
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.440]   on that company as, let's say, a Snowflake or whatnot.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.720]   But one has a 90% retention rate or something,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.720]   which means that sales and marketing is required forever
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.000]   to refuel the customer base
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.920]   because of the churn rate of that product.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.280]   And it means you'll never actually converge on,
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.480]   you'll never actually converge on cashflow
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.240]   at the level of a company with, you know,
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.760]   let's say a 110 retention rate or whatnot,
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.080]   because the moment you stop spending on sales and marketing,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.240]   that customer will drop,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.760]   the company will drop their customers
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.680]   and they won't have any cashflow.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.560]   So, but like, but like from afar,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.240]   they were like plotting on the regression line, you know,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.720]   like they should be funded or, you know,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.240]   like the valuation should be a Snowflake.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.360]   So that's, I don't know how, you know,
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.640]   I mean, the market eventually kind of gets that right
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.680]   on a per name or category basis.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.960]   But I do think, like,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.240]   if you don't really understand the dynamics
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.160]   of these categories,
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.360]   it gets easy to sort of not understand like,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.960]   well, how will this company actually produce real cashflow
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.280]   in the future in three or five or 10 years out?
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.120]   - Yes.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.840]   - Hey, one quick question for you, Aaron.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.480]   I've noticed over many years of investing in startups
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.080]   that a lot of times the product market fit
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.480]   of the first product will get you,
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.400]   especially a really good product market fit,
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.920]   will get you to a hundred million or 200 million
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.200]   or some really large level,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.960]   but then start to peter out.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.520]   And then you have to figure out other growth drivers.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.600]   And so I imagine, you know,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.120]   just based at the scale you're at,
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.360]   you've had that kind of thought process,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.480]   like how do we drive growth for a more mature startup
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.160]   or a company that's a little bit further along?
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.440]   Any hints for everybody?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   - Yeah, it's so case by case,
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.920]   'cause it all depends on probably
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.400]   how big your first category is.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.120]   And so, you know, as a founder,
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.560]   you always think your first category
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.960]   is gonna be just insanely massive.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.520]   And so you can kind of run the clock on that.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.800]   And we were really,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.640]   I think we actually paid a lot of attention to this
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.320]   around kind of three, four or 500 million in revenue.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.640]   We said, okay, what's our next act?
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   And I think McKinsey did this analysis like 10 years ago
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.480]   around when your second act has to happen
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.320]   in your growth curve
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.720]   or else you basically just peter out.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.240]   So we got like pretty obsessed with that.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.800]   And so our second act was really our platform business,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.960]   which turned us from just being an application
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   that you bought at an end-user license
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.720]   to then you buy actually like our platform utilization.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.840]   And that certainly worked, that gave us a boost.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.440]   That has had different characteristics
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.000]   than just getting us to the billion
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   as quickly as we wanted.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.880]   So we had to get into security and workflow.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.760]   So it's like, we're beyond like second act
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.160]   and it's more like we've got multiple
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.320]   kind of additional capabilities that we monetize.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.520]   But you do have to,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.080]   there's definitely like a finessing
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.440]   to your product strategy, your go-to-market strategy.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.880]   Like we used to be like super SKU oriented
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.800]   and then we had to rebundle things.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.040]   And so your whole company is sort of,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   riding these shifts in some kind of concerted way.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.600]   And it's interesting like part of this,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.160]   part of this as like a founder
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.720]   and just your own kind of like acknowledgement
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.640]   of where you are in the journey is sort of saying,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.120]   okay, like there's two kinds of companies maybe out there.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.920]   Let's just like two kinds of successful companies out there
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.440]   for getting the ones that don't work or get acquired.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.120]   There's, wouldn't it be great
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.000]   if everybody was Google or Meta, that would be great.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.440]   Like you just grow 50% a year forever
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.040]   and then 10 or 20% a year.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.640]   But then, and that's fantastic.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.200]   Like I'd love to have a trillion dollar company.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.400]   Wouldn't love to be in Congress like Zuck is,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.360]   but other than that.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.760]   And then there's,
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.000]   but then there's like actually like extremely good,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.800]   valuable companies that you're,
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.720]   you just are building a real business.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   And like, you don't like,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   you don't think about them as Google or Meta or whatnot,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.360]   but they produce an insane amount of value for the world,
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.840]   for their customers, for their cultures and employees.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.680]   And so we started studying the Autodesks
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.160]   and Adobes of the world,
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   which is like, okay, well like what's a compounding model
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.920]   where you're growing 10 or 20%
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.960]   and your free cashflow is 30 to 40%.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.200]   And you just do that for like literally decades.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.800]   There was a company we studied a ton that,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.520]   it almost further proves the point
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.440]   in the past couple of weeks, Ansys.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.000]   We studied these guys a year or two ago
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.160]   and it's a $30, $40 billion,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.600]   and that being $30 billion company,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.520]   they just own their space of CAD,
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.480]   simulation, industrial software,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.040]   maybe $2 billion revenue, plus or minus,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.120]   40, 30, 40% margin.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.920]   Like that's a fantastic business.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.960]   Like everybody would love
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.360]   a 20 to $30 billion market cap company.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   And they don't have to deal with the sort of daily changes
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.960]   of Wall Street of, okay,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.240]   we're valuing growth at this percent more or whatnot.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.080]   They're just like,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.360]   let's just build a very profitable business,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.840]   like dominate our market and scale that.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.040]   And I think that, you know,
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.960]   I think it'd be great if the Valley also got, you know,
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.920]   more enthralled by those types of names.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.640]   - I love that idea of studying other businesses.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.760]   That's another thing that I think people don't do enough of,
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.040]   but going out and getting the peer data,
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.160]   looking at how others did it, finding those experts.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.320]   - Have you looked at like Cadence?
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.560]   - Not deeply.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.320]   - Okay, of course Brad has,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.120]   but like we should all be talking about Cadence more.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.920]   Like we should be talking about Cadence.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.600]   We should be talking about Synopsys.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.000]   We should be talking about Ansys.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.640]   Like these are crazy,
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.680]   like literally like 15 years ago, Cadence was a,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.520]   I'm going to make up a number,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.280]   so please just like do all your charts or whatever.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.400]   Like, I don't know, three, $5 billion company.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.520]   It's a 50, $60 billion company today.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.240]   Like, and just dominate a vertical and just keep building
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.520]   and just do it profitably.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.240]   And I think if we got as enamored by that as building Meta,
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.160]   you know, first of all,
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.200]   we'd have a lot less stress all the time.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.040]   But I think we'd just be building, you know,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   more attractive and valuable companies.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.400]   - Speaking of dominating in Meta,
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.440]   several of the large companies reported last week, Brad.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.640]   And if I think about the public markets,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.520]   like prior to, right prior to 2024,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.960]   everybody's talking about Magnificent Seven, Own 2023,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.680]   and everybody's talking about cost reduction in the Valley
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.760]   is something you're very familiar with
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.840]   from your back and forth with Meta.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.480]   So what did we learn this week that,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.160]   and how does it affect the playing field?
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.960]   - Well, yeah, I mean, so you and I talked about last week,
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.200]   you know, 2023, like all these things were up a lot,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.240]   but it was really reversion to the mean.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   I mean, we started 2024 still trading below
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.600]   kind of the 10-year average.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.920]   That's how debilitating '22 was, right?
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.920]   But I said this year,
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.960]   like I thought this year would be more normalized.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.360]   Like I think return expectations, you know,
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.640]   are more in kind of that 15 to 25 range,
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.600]   not, you know, the return to target of 80
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.800]   like we had at the start of '23.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.480]   But, you know, I went into Q1
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.200]   kind of holding my breath a little bit to see, right,
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.120]   what in fact, whether or not we were seeing
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.320]   any of this acceleration.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.680]   So, you know, we had Google, we had Meta,
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.280]   we had, you know, Amazon and Microsoft report last week.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.040]   And I had a couple, a few big takeaways.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   The first was, you know, the Mag Seven's
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.080]   really not the Mag Seven
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.880]   and maybe the Mag Four right now, right?
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.720]   Because we have, you know, a few of these companies,
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.680]   Apple's flat on the year, Tesla's down on the year,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.040]   Google's basically flat on the year, you know,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.480]   and you have four companies that are-
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.200]   - We could have gotten ChadGBT
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.080]   to do a really nice illustration of that dynamic,
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.760]   the seven with three of them falling behind.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.280]   - I think- - We still can, I guess.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.800]   - We'll insert that post-fact.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.640]   You know, but last week, what we saw at a Meta,
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.000]   and I think this is really significant, you know,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.520]   obviously as a big beaten race,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.680]   stocks up over 30% year to date,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.760]   they're clearly benefiting, right?
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.800]   They are at the tip of the AI spear.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.320]   Their video engagement was up 25% year over year,
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.600]   which is just like hard to get your head around.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.400]   There's only one way to do that,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.120]   that's through the application of AI.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.000]   We're seeing their monetization also up a lot, you know,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.360]   but here's the thing that I think is so impressive, right?
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.600]   They nearly tripled their earnings per employee, right?
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.680]   Their head count in Q3 of 22 was 87,000,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.160]   this quarter they reported 67,000.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.600]   So they're doing this while they're like,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.480]   they really believe that Flatter is faster.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.600]   And I think there are a lot of people
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.680]   who are cutting 9% or 12% or this or that, you know,
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.600]   and it's not a fundamental change
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.320]   to the ethos of the business.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.080]   It's just a little bit more CYA, you know,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.640]   and I think that, you know,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.840]   what you see with Mark is a real commitment
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.080]   to transform that business,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.320]   and it's showing up in, you know, in the results.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.520]   And, you know, I think I tweeted something about,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.600]   you know, Reality Labs is still losing,
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.640]   I think, $20 billion.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.560]   And if you look at that on a per share number, okay,
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.920]   and that's about $6 a share, you know,
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.240]   in losses for the company due to Reality Labs.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.440]   And if you apply a 20X multiple to that,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.840]   that's about negative $120 a share
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.880]   that's being attributed to the valuation of Meta
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.720]   as a result of their--
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.160]   - Hold on, hold on, Jack, that's only true
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.760]   if you put zero future free cash flow
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.880]   from that unit in your analysis.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.520]   - Yeah, no, I-- - Which maybe you're doing.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.120]   - Well, I would like to think that everybody
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.440]   was doing that analysis, Bill,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   but you and I both know that most sell-side analysts
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.880]   are slapping a 20X multiple on earnings for this company,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.120]   and, you know, that's what suffices for research these days.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.680]   And I would just say, in a consolidated view,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.000]   that is pretty crazy to me,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.200]   and Zuck even mentioned on the call--
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.800]   - Well, but also, I mean, alternatively, Bill,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.760]   like, it's not, like, it's also not crazy
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   because how should you figure out, like,
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.400]   what the actual profit potential is of Reality?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.560]   Like, we have no evidence at the moment
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.400]   of what that looks like.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   So, everything else would just be a made-up number.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.560]   - Fair. - So, I don't know.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.120]   - But any non-zero, you know,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.640]   one of the things that Mark said during the call
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.280]   is that the Meta AI glasses with Ray-Ban,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.440]   they sold twice as many as they expected to sell, okay?
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.760]   I think we're gonna have this explosion of AI devices
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.280]   we're gonna talk about a little bit later.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   But he said that was the first clear example
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.960]   of some of this convergence
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.000]   between the work that they're doing in Reality Labs, right,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.840]   and what they're doing in the rest of the business.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.520]   And so, you know, again, as an investor,
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   I assign greater than negative $120 a share value
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.360]   to Mark Zuckerberg investing $20 billion a year
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.440]   on something that's in the zip code of AI,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.520]   you know, and augmented reality.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.600]   The second thing we saw this week, Bill, Google,
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.720]   you know, I mean, it was a solid quarter,
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.440]   but the stock is flat to down now on the year.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   I think you're seeing increasing concern
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.080]   about the core business, you know,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.400]   from threats, you and I've talked about this,
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.360]   chat GPT, perplexity, just go through the list,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.400]   you go into any room,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.120]   clearly answer engines are becoming more relevant.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.400]   Well, you know, when you said, you know,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.040]   chat GPT could have made the chart,
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.920]   you didn't say BARD could have made the chart
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.400]   or Google could have made the chart.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.000]   So I would say Google Cloud was pretty uninspired.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.640]   And I think, I don't think they've gotten real
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.360]   on the efficiency and the fitness.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.600]   You know, I have a slide here,
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.960]   I asked my team to pull together.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.640]   This slide plots, you know, what they've done on headcount
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.320]   and what that translates into
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.480]   in terms of earnings per employee
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.000]   over the course of those, you know, same six quarters, right?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.160]   And so Facebook has actually reduced headcount significantly
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.640]   and their earnings per employee has exploded.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.800]   And Google kind of, you know, they're fine,
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.240]   but they really just haven't made many changes.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.200]   Now, if this was just about earnings per employee
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.040]   in the short term,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.480]   then you see your differential
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.800]   in terms of share price performance right there.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.840]   I think a much, much bigger issue here
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.400]   is the implications this has for future product development.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.720]   The implications it has for, you know,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.560]   real focus out of the business.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.360]   And I just think this flatter is faster is very real.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.280]   I think that Meta is very focused
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.680]   and I think that Google is still trying to sort out,
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.440]   you know, how to get focused around some of this stuff.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.320]   And then finally, cloud software, you know,
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.160]   after a year of belt tightening,
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.600]   you know, what we really heard out of Amazon
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.880]   and Azure last week is that kind of core workloads
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.920]   are back to their prior growth rates, right?
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.360]   So that CFOs are largely through the, you know,
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.080]   the belt tightening on the core.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.720]   And we saw real evidence, right,
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.600]   of AI workloads beginning to kick in.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.920]   Both at Amazon, as well as at Azure.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.960]   I think Azure, I've got a couple of charts here,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.440]   you know, that the team threw together.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.800]   The first is just, you know,
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.960]   you can see the reacceleration on the right-hand side
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.440]   in terms of this is all three
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.880]   of the cloud providers put together.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.360]   So this is their growth, aggregated growth rate.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   And on the right-hand side,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.640]   you can see you finally saw that turn, that reacceleration.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.400]   Now, mind you, these things are reaccelerating
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.240]   in the case of AWS from $100 billion run rate, right?
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.960]   So like, you know, you're reaccelerating.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.160]   These are massive growth rates at massive scale.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.480]   On the left side, what you see
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.200]   is they actually set a record quarter,
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   15 billion in net new ARR across these three platforms.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.520]   So I think, you know, that to me is, you know,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.480]   kind of the real story that came out of, you know,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.460]   out of the big cloud providers.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.520]   And, you know, one of the questions I think
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.720]   that we now have to answer, you know,
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.360]   is does that read through apply
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.760]   to everybody else in software, right?
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.700]   Like, you know, is this something that's unique
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.000]   to the big cloud providers?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.160]   And then the second question that I had in my mind,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.520]   you know, was like, when do we just hit the wall on this?
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.720]   Right?
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.640]   I, you know, I had a friend to say to me the other day,
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.320]   they thought that three years from now
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.720]   that the cloud providers,
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.840]   the revenues would actually be smaller
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.160]   than they are today, right?
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.200]   Which I can't get my head around.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.080]   When I look at this, you know,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.240]   I talked to Adam Solepski who runs AWS,
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.920]   and he said, "Brad, this is a multi-trillion dollar market,
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.880]   and that does not include AI."
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   Okay, so yeah, $100 billion is a lot,
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.040]   but it's a multi-trillion dollar market,
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.400]   and it doesn't include AI.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.960]   So Aaron, I can't get back over to you.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.720]   That's, you know, that's my brain dump
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.700]   on what happened in the public markets this week,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.040]   but on the software side in particular,
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.360]   you know, were you surprised at these numbers?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.140]   And how do you think about,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.120]   is this unique to what's going on with the cloud providers?
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.000]   You know, or are you starting, you know,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.280]   to, you know, hear other software companies
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.340]   talking about how, about similar trends?
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.600]   - Yeah, so first of all,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.900]   you might wanna short your friend's portfolio,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.480]   or do the, I've never heard that metric of,
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.400]   in three years from now, we're gonna be smaller,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.340]   but that's an interesting take.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.260]   I honestly am so done with trying to guess
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.400]   when this thing runs out.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.560]   Like, it is, I think we just have to honest,
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.920]   like, you basically are just,
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.280]   it is an uncapped, unknowable total amount
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.040]   of addressable market in this space.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.880]   There are clear differences between the hyperscalers
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.040]   and the rest of software simply because
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.640]   a company can just move their core data center infrastructure
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.280]   from their, you know, their current colo
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.600]   and server providers to the cloud.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   And, you know, some software providers
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.760]   will make money in that transition,
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.400]   but that's basically 90% hyperscaler benefit.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.280]   And so that doesn't sort of all show up
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.020]   in the rest of software and SaaS in the same way.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.160]   So there's some kind of tale of two cities
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   of these massive infrastructure migration
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.620]   where the hyperscalers are just, you know,
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.760]   again, uncapped market opportunity for these guys.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.240]   And then there's a lot of surrounding services
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.080]   like you would imagine that as this goes up,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.120]   the snowflakes and confluence and whatnot
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.080]   also see some benefit 'cause there's lots of data services
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.800]   that you need around that.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   But yeah, we're not seeing any slowdown of, you know,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.960]   companies that we talk to just continuing
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.280]   to be moving to the cloud.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.240]   I, you know, get the fortune of talking to, I don't know,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.480]   you know, dozens of CIOs a month.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.860]   And there's nobody that is sort of like
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.340]   done with their cloud journey.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.740]   There's nobody even at 90%.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.420]   And this is across every sector of the economy.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.180]   So we're still weirdly relatively early.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.660]   And then to Adam's point, like, yeah,
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.820]   like that's even pre-AI.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.340]   AI is just in the experimentation phase
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.620]   for all intents and purposes in the enterprise right now.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.860]   And so we don't even have the AI TAM, you know,
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.900]   quite understood from a software
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.380]   or infrastructure standpoint yet.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.040]   - Brad made the comment that in his view
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.600]   from checking around that CIOs had moved past
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.120]   their kind of shrink and reassessment.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.000]   Do you agree with that?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.960]   - I wouldn't want anybody to like trade
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.120]   on my like qualitative anecdotes, but-
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.480]   - Yes, you're right, Aaron and Bill.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.160]   As a reminder to everybody,
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.040]   just our opinions, not investment advice.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.160]   - But you know, there's like,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.680]   there's very clearly this interrelated, you know,
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.220]   system of like, you are like listening to Powell's commentary
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.940]   and then deciding at your management committee meeting,
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.260]   you know, should we lean into budget, you know?
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.020]   And so, you know, if we're only hearing
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.500]   doom and gloom 18 months ago, inflation is exploding,
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.460]   interest rates are about to go crazy,
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.100]   massive layoffs happening in tech,
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.660]   that's like a scary environment to then be investing,
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.860]   you know, and leaning into whether it's a software company
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.280]   or an insurance provider in, you know, Minneapolis,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.480]   like we're all, you know,
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.240]   kind of thinking about this the same way.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.640]   Fast forward to today, you know, okay,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.320]   inflation coming down clearly,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.920]   interest rates either at the peak
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.820]   or starting to come down at some point,
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.960]   like I feel like, okay, we could invest a bit more,
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.080]   which means that that incremental application
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.200]   we wanted to launch that had some data consumption
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.600]   as a part of it, you know, the extra focus
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.780]   of the engineers working on optimization versus innovation,
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.760]   you can kind of tune that knob a little bit.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.140]   And so I think that's the sort of qualitative
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.220]   not captured in the, you know, econometrics,
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.180]   you know, kind of elements of this
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.020]   that are actually happening now in businesses,
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.860]   which gives me a little bit of, you know,
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.260]   incremental confidence that that means CIOs
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.400]   are gonna be putting on more growth initiatives
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.240]   going forward.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.000]   - Hey, Aaron, you just hit on something so important.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.220]   You know, perhaps one of the greatest sources of alpha
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.300]   for me and certainly my mentors in this business
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.100]   over a long period of time is this idea
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.100]   of positive and negative reflexivity, right?
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.160]   That in fact, when there is all doom and gloom,
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.360]   that causes people to behave in a certain way, right?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.480]   And when confidence begins, you know,
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.600]   like as we started entering this year,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.340]   as confidence is turning and the second derivative
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.360]   on interest rates is down, et cetera,
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.820]   it leads to the positive reflexivity on the other side.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.680]   So it actually leads to acceleration
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.720]   because people feel comfortable in doing that.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.000]   And you need to invest ahead of that, right?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.060]   And oftentimes to really get ahead of it,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.460]   you have to be buying when there is, you know,
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.000]   the proverbial blood in the streets,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.740]   when there is that doom and gloom
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.740]   and people say it can't ever, you know,
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.260]   it can't ever be different.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.060]   - Well, yeah, yes.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.020]   I mean, I can only imagine though,
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.340]   there is some timing element to that
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.740]   because you have to know when you've reached the bottom
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.980]   of the doom and gloom. - Of course, of course.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.300]   - But that aside, which I don't actually wanna like
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.900]   veer this politically at all, but like,
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.060]   as just like a bookmark, this is,
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.380]   I get very confused why we are so passionate
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.900]   about changing the government right now.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.400]   Like, they're like, they're nailing it.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.200]   Like, why pull out a Jenga piece out of nowhere
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.680]   and then see what changes.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.080]   But again, you know, different podcasts,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.060]   but like, we are so lucky right now
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.160]   that we somehow landed this thing.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.560]   And sure, there's, you know, a bunch of incremental issues
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.200]   on the margin that we're dealing with,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.720]   but like, wow, we should like be, you know,
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.000]   not taking this for granted too much.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.120]   So that's a software take.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.520]   I know you have opinions on this other one as well.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.440]   Right, there's, you know, there's a spicy battle out there
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.680]   about, you know, Google and 10 Blue Links and, you know,
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.200]   and what happens next.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.920]   And, you know, I tweeted over the weekend, you know,
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.520]   this isn't a question about like knowing, right?
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.280]   Larry and Sergei always knew that 10 Blue Links
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.600]   was like a waypoint in route to answers, right?
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.560]   Like anybody who was in the business
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.360]   of information retrieval,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.440]   or they've been around artificial intelligences
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.560]   and out in front of everybody else.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.480]   And so the idea here is that, you know,
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.400]   I think it's not a matter of will,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.720]   I don't think it's a matter of knowing, right?
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.920]   I just think it's this innovators dilemma, right?
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.200]   That Google faces, which is that 99% of their profits
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.880]   or 110% of their profits comes from an advertising model
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.680]   around 10 Blue Links that is just at its core
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.280]   seems somewhat at odds with what Perplexity is doing,
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.400]   with what ChatGPT is doing, the age of answers.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.880]   And so I would just love to, you know,
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.440]   kick it around for a second.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.280]   How, if you're running Google today, right?
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.120]   And you're faced with this innovators dilemma around this,
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.000]   like what should they be doing here?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.720]   - Well above my pay grade, fortunately,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.600]   I am just a lowly enterprise software.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.400]   (laughing)
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   But, you know, so as a reminder, obviously for everybody,
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.200]   like innovators dilemma is about business model,
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.160]   you know, difficulties.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.360]   And we always think it's a technology problem.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.480]   It's always about your business model,
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.200]   doesn't make the new thing attractive to you.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.800]   And so you avoid doing it until you get disrupted.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:43.440]   You know, I might take after, you know,
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.240]   thinking about this a little bit, maybe not enough,
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.360]   is I don't think there's a totally 100% classic
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.320]   innovators dilemma issue with the move to AI with Google.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.840]   I think on the other end of this,
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.640]   the business model could be as good if not better.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.760]   And Brad, you think about this a lot of like,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.000]   if you actually had Google literally tell you
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.760]   the thing to buy and they got a transaction on that,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.560]   it would actually be a similar business model.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.680]   They would just get you to that answer even faster
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.760]   and you'd still transact and you'd still do commerce
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.280]   and they are still the distribution engine
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.880]   for all of the people that need to advertise somewhere.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.200]   Like everybody has to find a customer
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.000]   and so you still need an interface
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.280]   to get my product into that customer's hands.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.040]   And so if Google's AI is doing that better
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.240]   than the 10 blue link model, that's great.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.360]   I actually think that the more complicated thing
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.360]   is probably more of a product management,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.280]   user behavior experience issue,
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.880]   which is how do I navigate my customer base?
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.480]   How do I navigate my user base to this model
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.880]   in a way where in the process,
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.400]   I don't get totally hammered by that journey.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.000]   And I don't know how to do that.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.320]   Like Bart is clearly their way of experimenting to do that.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.920]   But like, their big problem is like,
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.680]   you go to a search box, you type in a search
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.960]   and they give you a lot of results
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.200]   and Perplexity and ChatGBT
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.080]   are just totally different product interfaces.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.480]   And so they can't clearly make
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.700]   the Google homepage just do that.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.540]   So they have to kind of--
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.760]   - Doesn't that sound, doesn't that rhyme in your ear?
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.920]   I mean, 1999, Google was just a different interface
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.920]   relative to the portals that existed at the time.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.440]   And you can say, why the hell didn't Yahoo just copy Google
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.040]   because they had an existing business model
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.720]   that required them to sell real estate on this big port.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   - There was, probably you're 90% more right,
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.920]   but there was also a literal tech differentiation
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.840]   that Google had, and Yahoo did not have PageRank.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.800]   And so Google just literally gave you better results.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.460]   And so the user base migrated.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:45.160]   I mean, short of maybe some internal
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.800]   kind of political issues,
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.720]   like Google's technology is probably
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.200]   not in the way of this issue.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.520]   And so now it's actually like a, as a user.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.640]   Now, I will leave like one big X factor,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.200]   which is just like, maybe our brains are the limiter here.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.880]   And like ChatGBT just owns that little slot in our brain
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.200]   of you ask a question, get an answer.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.520]   And like, now we have like a whole
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.200]   like brain rewiring problem
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.440]   that Google's gonna have to contend with.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.960]   I don't know, I mean, like that's above the,
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.080]   that's above what a PM on the Google search homepage can do.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.840]   So this one is, you know, pretty complicated.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.600]   Bill, were you raising your hand?
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.240]   - I didn't want to interrupt.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.400]   So for the college game day fans,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.720]   I'll do a lead course, so not so fast.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.140]   I'll take the other side of this one.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.460]   - Okay.
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.320]   - I think it's a horrific problem.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.160]   - Oh wow.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.820]   - Because one is the user interface
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.460]   is subject to disruption.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:45.060]   So the whole idea that I'm gonna throw you 10 links,
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.340]   it's really more than 10, right?
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.860]   'Cause there's four ads on top and four ads on the bottom
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.200]   and you gotta search through and find what you want.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.280]   I'm a big sports fan.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.740]   I often search for the roster of a team.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.400]   That's not even at the top.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.240]   - No, yeah.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.400]   - It's like five links down.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.760]   I have to find it and get around the ads.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.360]   So it's like, so that's one.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.120]   Two, you already mentioned the business model.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.300]   Their business model is to throw their customers
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.840]   in a cage match and let them compete
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.060]   with one another to the death.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.980]   And that drove revenue sky high
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:24.580]   because it created Prado, like a super optimal payment.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.900]   And no one wants to see four or five ads.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.580]   You're not gonna get to the same revenue per visit
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.100]   with a transaction model that you do with the ad model
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.180]   because you already mentioned Cactail TV.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.000]   People will pay using marketing math,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.400]   40, 50, 60% of first purchase
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.080]   with a transactional integration, they wanna pay 5%.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.560]   So you have a 10X reduction if you were to partner
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.400]   on a transaction enablement than you do on a marketing lead.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.040]   And so the customer wants neither of those on the screen.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.380]   - Yeah, I'm gonna push back a little bit on the...
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.320]   So when I said transaction, it didn't necessarily mean
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.080]   that you turn it into a CPA model, but maybe you do.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.600]   And I understand the changes in economics there.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.120]   I guess what I'm saying is that when I do a Chachabity
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.680]   question of, "Hey, give me a recipe for this thing."
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.800]   It's actually a gap that they don't then let me
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.920]   go buy the things that...
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   - But if you were to go buy 'em, you wouldn't buy 'em
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.360]   from a marketing model, you'd buy 'em
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.600]   from a transactional model.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.720]   Otherwise you're gonna say, "I'd like to book a flight
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.760]   to Chicago and get a hotel room."
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.760]   And instead of doing it, the Google AI is gonna say,
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.740]   "Would you like to hear deals from Hotels.com
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.540]   and Expedia and Booking.com?
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.160]   Can I read you through the deals they're offering?"
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.640]   Like that's not...
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.260]   - Brad, you're the expert on this.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.940]   Why can't Google get $40 for that flight
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.780]   or $30 for that flight instead of the $2
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.700]   for clicking through to Expedia?
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.220]   - Well, I think to Bill's point,
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.140]   if you look at the traditional commission models,
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.520]   and I think the iconic example is in travel,
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.860]   the traditional commission model, for example,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.380]   in hotels is 10%.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.020]   And let's just say the average daily rate is 100 bucks.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.180]   So they're willing to spend on a commission model, 10 bucks.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.420]   But in a marginal advertising model
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.780]   where they're bidding up all the way to their gross profit
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.260]   on in order to get that next customer
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.380]   to drive that growth rate, which I think...
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.380]   And if you're a startup, you certainly go above it.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.340]   You may spend two or three X on that individual purchase.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.500]   It certainly has extracted more rents.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.420]   But I think the other piece here
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:47.220]   is that if we really just telescope way out here,
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:51.300]   like we are heading to answers and actions, right?
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.580]   And even the people who invented the damn Blue Link model
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.780]   don't believe that that is where this thing ends.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.020]   So like, and all I'm saying is the idea
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.900]   that Google can replicate a 99% monopoly
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.660]   and take all of that pool of profits with it
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.660]   into this new world after letting chat GPT become the verb,
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.620]   at least at the start for what this new world is.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.820]   It just, that to me is almost impossible to believe,
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.540]   but the consensus view has continued to be
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.880]   that they're going to dominate this new thing
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.060]   the way they dominated the world of search.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.140]   And I just think if they pull that off,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.940]   I hope I'm a shareholder along the way,
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.020]   that will be one of the greatest jujitsus
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.660]   in the history of capitalism.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.980]   I'll be remarkably impressed.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.220]   One last thing.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.820]   There's one last problem.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.060]   In addition to everything I brought up,
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.460]   because their core business model
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.380]   is to throw their customers in a cage match.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:50.380]   They don't have the culture internally
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.540]   to partner in a friendly win-win way.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.940]   Every company I've ever had that sat down
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.420]   to do a deal with Google has been shown a contract
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.500]   that you would never, ever, ever, ever consider.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.680]   And if we're going to get to a place
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.180]   where I just tell Google my favorite travel site is this,
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.420]   my whatever, they're going to have to work out a deal
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.660]   that's reasonable on both sides.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.380]   And I don't think they're capable of it.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.100]   I don't think they're capable of sitting down
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.700]   and it becomes a cultural problem
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.280]   because if every meeting you have
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.680]   with an external third party,
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.500]   you bring this kind of I'm in charge attitude,
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.420]   getting that out of a company is very, very, very hard.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I see something else.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.380]   - You don't have to agree with that.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.820]   - No, I know that there's great anecdotes
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:44.820]   of that problem in tech, but at the end of the day,
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.580]   the entire world is advertising on Google.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.900]   So they clearly have made,
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.660]   they clearly figured out how to partner
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.260]   with the CMO of every company on the planet.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.940]   And so if our CMO got a call that said,
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.940]   "Hey, from Google, we can get you more customers
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.460]   when they ask a question about content management software."
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.060]   We're still going to say like,
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   we're going to follow where the distribution is.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.260]   So at the end of the day,
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.620]   and so then that's why I still think it's all,
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.980]   like the name of the game is still,
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.100]   can they navigate their customer base
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.540]   to a new user experience paradigm?
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.020]   Well, obviously fast enough before,
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.180]   you know, it's the classic can Amazon become a studio
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.300]   before the studios become Amazon or Apple or whatever.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.060]   - I mean, the company with the buzz is perplexity,
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.260]   not even chat GPT.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:32.140]   And so like barge not in the top two, right?
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.940]   - Yeah, but then you get into a different issue,
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.580]   which is like, obviously they should just buy these things.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.980]   And then, you know, Lenacon doesn't let that happen.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.100]   So, you know, how do you like,
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.060]   like if they bought perplexity, call it Google assistant,
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.700]   like, I don't think we'd be having this conversation
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.380]   in the same way, but they obviously, you know-
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.700]   - That's a fair point.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.540]   - Yeah.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.140]   - Which is like the Instagram WhatsApp.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.620]   - I'm just saying that's like Instagram WhatsApp,
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.820]   what he's saying and what metadata.
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.620]   And so Google's like not allowed to do that right now,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:03.460]   which is pretty interesting.
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.300]   - Yeah, it's totally crazy.
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.140]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.980]   - Which actually, one last thing,
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:11.980]   it's similar to Microsoft in the '96, '97 timeframe
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.500]   where they were, you know, in the penalty box
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.500]   and couldn't do those similar things.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.340]   - Yeah.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.340]   - I would say it's not only the government's not allowing,
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.780]   but you gotta remember with Instagram and WhatsApp,
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.700]   it was not, they were not facing an innovator's dilemma.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.380]   Those deals did not cannibalize their core business
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.580]   in the way that perplexity would cannibalize,
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.620]   at least in part, the core business at Google.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:33.660]   - Some of the searches.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.020]   - Let me shift us forward.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.900]   You know, you brought up, you know,
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.340]   a subject on our episode one, Aaron,
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:45.100]   we talked about, you know, these interesting investments
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.020]   made by one of my partners had called MANG.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.420]   So investments by Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Google
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.980]   into the big model businesses.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:57.100]   Bill suggested, you know, that at a very minimum,
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.380]   that's low quality revenue.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.420]   But, you know, this credit for investment thing
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.900]   as we've seen historically in the past,
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.780]   it wasn't lost on me that the very next day
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.340]   that the FTC came out, I think we have a tweet on this.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.580]   It was on Squawk, you know, and said,
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.180]   "Hey, we're gonna look into the nature
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.680]   "of these relationships, you know,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.100]   "between, you know, the open AIs and Microsoft's, et cetera."
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.780]   So Bill, just to close that one out
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.420]   before we jump into our third topic,
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.180]   you know, what do you think the outcome is of this inquiry
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.700]   that, you know, that the FTC announced, you know,
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.340]   which was right in line with some of the things
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.220]   that you were talking about?
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.020]   - My concern, which was really a concern for the industry
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.820]   more than just those players,
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.940]   is that those deals pervert and distort the market.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.500]   And when that happens, people do things you wouldn't expect.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.460]   Just like Zerp, all of a sudden,
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:48.860]   competition doesn't look like you would think it would
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:50.380]   because those are happening.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.060]   And just real quick, the one thing that,
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.780]   I don't think Lena was,
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.220]   she never mentioned accounting or anything like that,
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.460]   but the bright lights, you know, being shined at it
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.060]   might prevent more of those deals in the future,
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.020]   which I think would be healthier for the environment.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.220]   - The thing that I actually don't understand
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:11.380]   for you guys is, so if I'm a big tech company,
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.180]   I have an entirely different incentive structure
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.460]   for these rounds than, obviously, a venture capitalist,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:20.060]   and yet they're pricing these companies.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:20.900]   - Totally.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.740]   - So that's the distortion effect
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.780]   for either those rounds directly
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.740]   or for everybody else in the space.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.900]   It's like, yes, X company got a $20 billion valuation
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.540]   from a non-economic actor.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.460]   That does not make your revenue or your multiple
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.860]   have any correlation to that
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.620]   because the acquisition premium
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:40.060]   or the ultimate cashflow of this company
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   doesn't have any relationship to the credit model
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.540]   that just got a deal done.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.820]   - I think it's even trickier
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.220]   because based on what I've read,
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:54.220]   secondary transactions are kind of expected now
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:59.100]   in the hiring, in that world, that LLM competition world.
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:02.380]   And if you can't get a financial investor
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:06.740]   to invest alongside, 'cause these are non-cash credits,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.660]   then you don't have the cash to do the secondaries
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.220]   and you can't keep up.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.420]   And then that's tricky.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:16.180]   And on our last show, Brad talked about
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.580]   why these big companies might have an incentive
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.620]   that's other than ownership at the right price.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:26.220]   So that, as you're saying, the valuation's not real.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.140]   And there's all kinds of problems this can create,
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:32.100]   especially if you're running the company.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.700]   - Yeah, I think, unfortunately, there's an inevitable,
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.380]   there's gonna be an inevitable,
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.900]   that the music will stop at some point
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.820]   on this particular dynamic.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.260]   OpenAI aside, just because they actually
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.100]   do have the traction,
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.260]   they probably do have the real revenue.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.100]   - Right.
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.820]   - But I don't love to see the broadening of this,
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.940]   just from a, again, healthiness of this model.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:57.420]   - I mean, Bill referred to it a little bit,
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.980]   like the SoftBank effect from '20 and '21,
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.380]   where capital was used as a weapon of economic destruction,
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.620]   capital was the kingmaker and all of this,
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.260]   rather than allowing the product
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.860]   and the fundamental performance of the business to go.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.020]   But I'm gonna just shift this a little bit, Aaron,
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:17.060]   into perhaps a little bit broader discussion about AI.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:20.100]   You had a tweet that caught my eye,
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.860]   where you just said, this is,
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.380]   you've been around for a while,
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.580]   you're a deeply respected technologist.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.660]   You said, hey, we got this confluence of events
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.020]   going on in the world right now,
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.980]   confluence of technologies that make this, in many ways,
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.180]   the most extraordinary of times.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:38.100]   And so, as we dig into AI a little bit with you,
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.420]   maybe a little context for that tweet,
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.700]   and then I would love for you to go inside out.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.500]   Like, where are you actually seeing the traction
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.140]   for AI in your business?
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.260]   What are your guys' top three priorities
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.260]   in terms of leveraging AI?
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.700]   And how do you think those reflect
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.180]   the priorities of your peers?
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.700]   - Sure, yeah, I mean, this tweet specifically
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.620]   was related to a bunch of stuff,
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.060]   including Vision Pro or whatnot.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.660]   Just, I just think it's an incredibly exciting time,
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:10.500]   purely economics aside, to just be building technology.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.820]   We are literally given these platforms to build on
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.220]   that are doing incredible things
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.460]   that quite literally a decade or two ago
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.700]   was just not possible.
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.420]   So, that's more of an emotional, psychological thing
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.620]   of just like, hey, incredibly exciting time.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.500]   As it relates to the opportunities,
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.740]   and maybe then AI specifically,
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:35.660]   we are, so, maybe just like three seconds on Box,
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:36.620]   and then I'll broaden it.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.500]   So, what we're doing is we have
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.020]   hundreds of billions of files that are stored in Box,
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.180]   and every single one of those files
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.420]   has more value inside of the file
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.900]   than what currently the customer
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.460]   is kind of getting benefit from,
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.460]   'cause you have to like open up the file,
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.540]   look at it, read it, watch it,
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.740]   to get actual like real commercial economic benefit
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.900]   of that content.
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.380]   With AI, you now have little bots that can run around
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.700]   and do things on that content
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.940]   to generate more value for you.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.980]   You could get a decision in your business faster,
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.660]   you could summarize a contract and accelerate a workflow,
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.940]   you could extract data from something that's unstructured
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.420]   to automate a process that was un-automatable before.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.300]   So, that's why it's incredibly exciting for us.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:24.780]   The dynamic right now is, I think we have,
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.220]   we are still, even though we're a year and a quarter
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.060]   into Chachapiti phenomenon,
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.700]   we're still literally in the earliest of days.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.220]   I think most enterprises right now
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.860]   are just in the experimental period.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.260]   They are trying to figure out where to plug AI
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.580]   into their overall stack.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.740]   I don't think anybody has sort of fully figured that out,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.940]   you know, commonly across kind of normal corporations.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.780]   And that means that it's anybody's game right now
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.420]   in terms of the winners and losers of AI.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.420]   I think, you know, I probably prefer incumbents in software
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.740]   on the margin right now,
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.940]   because it's so important to have the customer data
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.060]   in an environment that is already trusted,
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.420]   is already secure.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.340]   They don't have to move the information back and forth.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.300]   They often already have the workflow.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.980]   So, if I'm thinking about who wins in CRM AI,
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.420]   it's to me Salesforce, as opposed to a startup.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.660]   ITSM AI, it's ServiceNow versus a startup.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.340]   That's like the quick thing,
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.180]   because there's not as much innovator's dilemma
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.900]   in the kind of pure software categories.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.060]   In fact, this is just really like an advantage
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.500]   for anybody, again, who has users, data, and workflows.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.460]   AI is like this dream come true,
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.660]   because now we can just literally offer more value
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.660]   to our customers.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.580]   So, that's sort of like in the classic incumbent categories.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.300]   I'm extremely bullish for startups.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.860]   They're just not gonna probably be about disrupting,
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.420]   you know, known categories of software.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.140]   There's probably much more about known categories
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.020]   of like the economy.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.300]   And so, I think if we spent like the past 20 to 30 years
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.460]   putting software, making it so, you know,
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.340]   software is a layer above what humans do.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.420]   Now we're at a point where software will just do
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.740]   what the human did.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.580]   And that creates a whole new vector of opportunities.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.860]   And I think, you know, the classic way to look at this
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.180]   is sort of like, you know,
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.060]   figure out which parts of knowledge work
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.780]   can convert into tokens.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.900]   And then those are the areas
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.140]   where there's new software opportunities
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.140]   that we did not have software for before.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.540]   And then those are the businesses.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.780]   So, I think there's, you know,
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.500]   there'll be trillions of dollars made in AI.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.340]   But I think it's gonna be in verticals.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.180]   It's gonna be, you know, kind of helping augment
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.220]   the people element of the work.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.460]   It's gonna be in the infrastructure
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.860]   and the scaffolding around it.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.100]   I'm a little bit bearish, not bearish,
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.780]   but just like more like on the margin,
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.580]   not as excited about the economics
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.700]   of the actual pure AI model providers.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.260]   I think it's tough to be in a space where Zuck,
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.540]   you know, at any day could just open source
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.780]   the thing that you've been working on
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.700]   for, you know, three or five years.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.740]   And then all of a sudden, you know,
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.340]   now there's just this leapfrog moment of technology.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.620]   And, you know, the thing that I go back to is like,
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.540]   there's rarely been technology I think we've seen
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.140]   where the actual, like the thing you're building,
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.700]   the asset you're building is almost perishable
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.300]   as a piece of IP.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.780]   Like the thing literally like can just become obsolete
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.860]   like a second later, and you can't update it.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.100]   You don't, like, I can't take the obsolete thing
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:26.940]   and make it a little better.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.180]   I have to like rerun the training run
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.620]   and then like do the new model.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.940]   And so I actually have like converted, you know,
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.620]   CapEx dollars into this like thing.
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.660]   And at any moment, something else could be better
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.500]   than that thing.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.020]   And I have no, I can't pivot around that.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.260]   Like I'm stuck with this perishable asset.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.780]   So then you kind of just say, okay,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.860]   well then OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, you know,
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.140]   Facebook are basically like where you place the bets
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.580]   on who makes the models.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.420]   And then everybody else
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.460]   should just be building software essentially.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.540]   - What about internally?
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:01.540]   I'm curious as someone that runs a large public company,
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:06.660]   how do you feel about like what's the right expectation
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.180]   for programmer productivity improvement?
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.180]   Are you measuring it?
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.900]   Do you care?
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.720]   Where in your org are you seeing impact early?
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.940]   - Yeah, so, you know, programming obviously
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.860]   the first place with Copilot.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.460]   And I don't know, we have not done
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.100]   a specific measurement internally.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.220]   You know, I'll walk, you know, through the office
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.420]   and see what's on people's screens.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.100]   And, you know, AI is certainly actively being used
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.700]   for in Chachaputi to optimize a code, you know,
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.740]   the code that somebody is working on, you know,
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.380]   how do I change this, you know, SQL query
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.500]   to be more efficient, that kind of stuff.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   Copilot obviously for writing code.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.420]   Obviously the estimates are, I would probably just agree
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.500]   with the estimates of, you know, 30, 40, 50%.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.460]   - That's what I heard.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.900]   Drunk said 7X yesterday.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.300]   Anyway, move on.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.420]   - Drunk said that?
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.260]   - I think he did.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.740]   - Yeah, okay, I have not seen somebody say that.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.300]   - I don't think that was accurate.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.140]   - Okay, got it.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.900]   - Yeah, I like the 70% number.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.300]   - Yeah, so I'm probably more in the, you know,
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.500]   30 to 50% camp in it, like in the best case scenario
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.820]   right now with where we're at.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.740]   And I think still coding is the number one use case.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.540]   And there's actually, I think this actually
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.220]   is an important element of thinking through AI.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.460]   Like coding is still working better
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.100]   than most other use cases.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.180]   And it's because you basically have a workflow
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.980]   where you're in a text interface that is just linear,
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:37.940]   where most of the sort of knowledge of the field
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.340]   is all public and open source for the most part
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.980]   and available for training runs.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.460]   And the next line prediction, you again,
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.820]   have the perfect interface for next line prediction.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.220]   Most knowledge work actually doesn't look like that.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.060]   Like we want it to, we want to believe.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:51.900]   - Timer structured.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.820]   - Yeah, and so, you know, even the legal work,
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.140]   I'm still like talking to the client
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.300]   and then like comparing something with somebody else.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:05.140]   And so this idea that you're gonna get a GitHub
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.260]   co-pilot effect for all forms of knowledge work,
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.380]   at least in the near term, it's way too early
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.860]   to be kind of jumping to that conclusion.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.260]   - Programming is like a more precise language than language.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.100]   - Yeah, and then literally it's automatically
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.780]   testable instantly.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.660]   And so you just don't have those characteristics
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.220]   for a lot of other work.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.860]   So I think it's gonna take longer than maybe we'd like
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.220]   for AI to sort of show up in the average knowledge workers
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.060]   sort of day at the level that GitHub co-pilot did.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.580]   You know, if you could automatically write
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.700]   all of my emails, you know, faster,
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.300]   I still would have to read each one.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.900]   I still have to process like,
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.740]   do I agree with that thing that is being said?
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.700]   I still need to understand the substance of the content
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.340]   from the sender.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.540]   I can't have AI just sort of jump in and replace me.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.780]   So I think we're probably a little bit early
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.580]   in the general knowledge work sort of transformation.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.340]   And the things I'm much more excited about
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.980]   are where can you take a process
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.900]   where a person does that kind of rote task
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.180]   over and over again,
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.500]   and we can swap that out with AI and improve that workflow.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.420]   And that's where the opportunity is
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.140]   and certainly what we're spending our time on.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.260]   - I mean, it reminds me so much,
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.500]   I saw this chart this week,
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.620]   maybe we can pull up from Morgan Stanley.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.940]   And it shows how we systematically underestimate
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.300]   the size of super cycles, right?
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.460]   Over a reasonable period of time.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.260]   When I think about what's going on here,
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.500]   of course, they show,
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.540]   they went back and did some math against initial estimates
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.700]   and said, you know,
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:38.340]   super cycles are about 40% underestimated at the start.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.580]   So, you know, the initial forecast for the PC
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.980]   or the initial forecast for internet 152 million users
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.340]   in 2000 ended up being 361 million users.
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.660]   When I think about what's gonna happen here,
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:54.820]   I can absolutely see sometime over the next four quarters,
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.420]   we're gonna hit a zone of disillusionment
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.500]   because everybody's pig piled in here.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.300]   They think it's all happening now.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.820]   It's gonna take a little bit longer,
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.860]   just like the internet did, just like cloud did, right?
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.220]   To hit its stride.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.700]   When that happens, those who were, you know,
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.060]   who are always against the super cycle,
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.700]   call it a fad, everything else,
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.060]   they're gonna say, see, I told you so, you know,
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.740]   it's not really happening the way you all thought it was,
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.940]   you know, you made bad bets, et cetera.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:24.860]   But my sense here is, you know, and I've said,
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.860]   the AI is gonna be bigger than the internet itself
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.940]   in terms of impact on economic productivity.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:32.620]   But I do think sometime in the next several quarters,
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.740]   we have this zone of disillusionment set in a little bit.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.900]   It doesn't happen quite as fast as we all thought.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:43.060]   But then when we look back three to five years from now,
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.220]   you know, you had a tweet about, you know,
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:49.180]   the dramatic reduction in costs of these models.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.060]   So you can imagine chat GPT five or six,
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.260]   and it's costing us 90, you know, percent less than today.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.020]   I don't even think we can get our heads around
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.660]   how that's going to change everything.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.620]   - Well, so most of, and just to underscore this,
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:08.140]   most, and again, we're like,
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.900]   we're deep in sort of the use cases of,
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.460]   I have a really long contract,
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.220]   I wanna read the contract,
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.820]   I wanna automatically present data
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.460]   from that contract with AI.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:21.860]   And so think about like, just all of those things,
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.420]   you know, an invoice, a contract, a presentation,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.100]   most of the things that customers are asking us for,
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.820]   what they want to do with their content
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.580]   is 100% possible.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.180]   And just, there's a curve, which is,
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:40.140]   is AI cheap enough to make that use case
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:42.500]   be worth transforming to a software-based way
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.540]   of doing that versus human-based way.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:47.660]   And so that's like exactly what you want in a market,
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.060]   because you know the costs are gonna come down,
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.820]   and then you'll reach that convergence point.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.460]   So like, we're increasingly not limited
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.740]   by the architecture of the technology.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.100]   And now we're just limited by like,
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.540]   can Jensen make these things cheaper?
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.300]   And can the, you know, can the engineers at OpenAI
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.140]   have more efficient model algorithms?
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.340]   And that's great,
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.820]   because then you can just ride that curve.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.700]   Like, we are way more inundated with use cases
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.900]   that companies want to do with AI today
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.380]   than simply just like the scalability of these architectures
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.100]   from a cost standpoint.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.460]   - Brad, I'll give you one other reason
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.900]   why I think you might be right
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.860]   about the trough of disillusionment.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.180]   You know, I saw this great interview once with Spielberg
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.060]   when he was talking about JAWS.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.580]   And he said, you know, I didn't show the shark
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.980]   until like 75% of the way through this thing.
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.620]   And the reason he said he did that
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.020]   was because human's imagination is much grander
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.900]   than anything I could possibly put on the screen.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:52.220]   And I, you know, we had AI before LLMs.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.380]   Like, I heard Nikesh bring this up once.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.780]   And so, but in our modern lexicon,
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:01.100]   we think of AI as chat GPT and what the LLM did.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.260]   That's what really shocked us.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:07.380]   And I just worry that the one, two, three thing
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.780]   has caused people to think
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.100]   there's this linear extrapolation.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.580]   I do think the text has kind of been solved
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.740]   and everything's kind of been scanned.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:22.740]   And I think the next steps not linear are super linear.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.940]   I think it's gonna be a little bit of a find.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.380]   - Well, I think that, I mean, the growth of cloud
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.060]   as just a shape of the curve is somewhat instructive
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.540]   because it at least closely approximates
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.620]   like the change management dynamic
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:42.340]   that is required to change your infrastructure architecture.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.020]   So obviously not a perfect analogy,
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:48.900]   but like anybody in '06, '07, when we saw AWS,
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.220]   we're like, oh shit, like this is clearly the future.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.020]   I would literally, I would never wanna go
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.620]   and manage servers again.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.220]   But now here we are, it's 2024
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.940]   and you have the biggest growth rates
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:02.140]   from a dollar standpoint still happening.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:06.820]   And so why is it taking 18 years for that still to occur?
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.020]   It's because there's somebody in a data center
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.180]   in Minneapolis that still has to just move the data.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.820]   They have to move the services into the cloud.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.700]   And so the equivalent of this is we'll talk to a customer
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.620]   and they say, we'll show them the demo
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.500]   of AI can now read that invoice
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.380]   and do what the human was doing instantly
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.860]   and much more cost-effectively.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.660]   But it's still gonna take a year or two
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.380]   to do the change management of the workflow itself
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.940]   to swap in AI for where the human was.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:36.780]   And so now multiply that-
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.060]   - Technically, it should have been an XML file
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.140]   and not an invoice.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:40.980]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.380]   Well, I believe me, I'm extremely,
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.780]   I'm glad that it's actually a document still.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:49.020]   And we're still in business
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.780]   'cause most of these things still are documents
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.620]   and not XML files.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.460]   - Fair enough.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.820]   - I still think the press, they watch the movie "Her",
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.820]   they expect chat GPT-7 to be this all-knowing,
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.820]   all-loving personality that they can talk to.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.380]   And this does spin to one thing
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.900]   I would be hyper-optimistic about.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:15.100]   I do think this memory issue is a big, big deal,
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.900]   at least on the consumer side.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.620]   So none of the major contenders today
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.300]   can remember who you are
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.780]   because it would require them,
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.260]   and I mean, remember over five years, 10 years
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.260]   to really become a personal assistant kind of thing
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.660]   that "Her" represented.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.060]   And it's because you'd have to redo the model
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:35.900]   for each human.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.700]   And of course that makes no sense economically.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.180]   So it's actually a huge structural problem.
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.780]   There are complaints in Reddit
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.820]   about character AI on this front.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.500]   I think all of the people sitting atop these companies
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.780]   know that this is a huge breakthrough opportunity.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.460]   And the first one that gets to it,
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.620]   I think could outrun whoever the contender is
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:00.180]   at that moment in time,
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.300]   because the things you could do,
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.180]   if it could remember everyone in your contact database,
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.620]   all your emails that you've done,
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.300]   like the thing, the personal productivity
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.020]   an individual could have,
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.340]   if this thing could be that way.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.860]   And I think most of the press thinks
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.340]   it'll be that way tomorrow.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.420]   And no one's really solved this problem yet.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.460]   I think it's a huge opportunity.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.340]   - Yeah, 100% right.
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.060]   - I'm gonna move us on to the fourth topic.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.980]   I mean, we could, we have to do a whole show
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.140]   just on that one that we're just on,
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.700]   because it's so good.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.980]   And I'm quite certain, Bill,
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.340]   that what you just talked about,
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.740]   a fiduciary, an agent, an assistant
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.460]   that knows me longitudinally,
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.620]   that knows everything about me,
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.420]   like my personal assistant,
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.660]   five years from now, this is cracked, right?
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.220]   The cost curve is gonna come down,
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.140]   the security curve, the confidence curve,
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.700]   all of those things are gonna intersect.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.700]   And we're going to give a personal assistant
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.620]   in people's pocket to billions of people.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.980]   And when we think about the broad implications
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.380]   to Apple, to Google, to Meta, et cetera,
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.100]   of this change, right?
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.420]   We haven't seen this scale of change in 25 years,
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.300]   but we'll come back to it.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.660]   Because Aaron, you had a tweet
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.540]   that really caught Bill and I's imagination.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.780]   You know, maybe we can pull it up on immigration.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.860]   And you know, like the world is, you know, right now,
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.820]   I think appropriately objecting
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.260]   to the insanity of illegal immigration
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.980]   and what's going on at the Southern border
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:25.180]   and lots of fights and finger pointing
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.780]   as to why that's going on.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.140]   But what was interesting about this
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.580]   is you took on the subject of legal immigration.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.820]   And, you know, why don't you explain to us a little bit
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:37.300]   about what the tweet was about and about this chart?
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.180]   I saw it went a little bit parabolic
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:42.140]   in terms of Twitter.
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.740]   - Well, I mean, unfortunately,
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.780]   Elon wrapped it into the illegal immigration as well.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.900]   So that was the only reason for the parabolic nature.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.380]   But my point was-
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.780]   - 22 million views, yes.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:58.100]   - Yeah, everybody really liked H1B immigration this day.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.460]   Actually, the amount of racist responses I got
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:02.140]   was pretty impressive.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.100]   So, I mean, it's so simple.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.220]   It is just the biggest cell phone in economic history.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.540]   We have the best environment
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:16.540]   for the smartest people on earth to contribute value.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:19.540]   And we are literally doing everything we can
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:22.140]   to make sure they cannot work here, pay taxes here,
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.820]   and start their next company here.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.820]   And so it's just the most offensively illogical thing
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.220]   that I think we have in the country.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:34.460]   I put it above all other things that we do
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.580]   that is totally inane.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:39.420]   And we are, you know, by the grace of God,
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.020]   Apple was created here, Google was created here,
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.180]   Microsoft was created here, Meadow was created here.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.900]   It is not a given that in 20 years from now,
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.740]   those companies will be created here.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.540]   So why not make sure, why not just like seal that
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.580]   and lock that in as a monopoly
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.940]   and get all of that talent here?
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.980]   And the thing that is crazy to me
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:00.820]   is that U.S. companies are currently employing
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.860]   all of the people we're talking about moving here.
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.980]   They're just employing them in a different country.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.460]   And we have expanded dramatically in Poland.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:12.100]   Facebook obviously expanded dramatically in India and UK.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.580]   Like we are employing all of these people.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:18.380]   It's just, we're not gonna get the local community benefits.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.180]   We're not gonna get the local tax dollar benefits.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.780]   And then we're certainly, when they go off
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.340]   and leave one of our companies,
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:25.220]   they're going to build a company
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.300]   that is in and native to their country.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.460]   And then it's over.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.660]   And we just have to pray
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.260]   that that is not the next Apple or Google or Microsoft.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:35.460]   And otherwise you just flip the entire
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.580]   kind of economic environment.
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.440]   And so it's just very frustrating.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.420]   This just happens to be a chart of H-1B demand
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.220]   and applications per year.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.380]   It's actually not even that interesting of a graph
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.620]   because if you actually looked at the true demand,
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:50.140]   if you could measure how many people actually wanted
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.620]   and were capable and qualified to work in the U.S.,
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.780]   the number would be five times larger.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.340]   And again, we are currently employing all of these people.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.260]   This is not going to reduce U.S. jobs.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.100]   They are employed.
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.120]   There's no way, the kind of responses I always get
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.820]   is somebody will randomly, some troll will be like,
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.320]   you're just trying to take U.S. jobs.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.160]   It's like, no, no, no.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.340]   Like no matter what this person on the other end
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.420]   is going to be employed by our company,
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.780]   they're just not going to be living in the U.S.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.740]   and improving our economy.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.300]   And so I think it's crazy.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:23.300]   And I think that, I'm a part of a kind of a tech lobbying
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.140]   kind of group or whatever.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.340]   We lobby about all the things all the time.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:30.340]   And so we'll meet with Congress and talk to the senators
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.820]   and Congress people about this.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:38.820]   And what's really sad is that on a one-on-one basis,
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.240]   everybody, right, left, everywhere in between
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.460]   agrees with the issue.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.960]   And there's just always one thing that's holding it up.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.920]   It's no, we have to solve the whole immigration package
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.720]   or we can't give this one,
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.720]   we can't give into this particular deal
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.840]   that we're working on.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.680]   And so this one little number in a document,
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.640]   i.e. the quota that we have,
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.020]   you just change that one number
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:04.740]   and our whole problem goes away
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.980]   and nobody's willing to do it.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.500]   Nobody's willing to just like sign up for that project
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.700]   in Congress to say, I'm going to do it.
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.620]   - Brad, do you have the chart of the actual grants
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:14.900]   that happens each year?
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.580]   It's flat, it's fixed.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.060]   - It's basically 85,000 a year
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.780]   and it's been that way for 20 years.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.380]   - 65K, that's H1B and then there's another form.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.020]   And the process is remarkably bureaucratic.
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.140]   So that's another thing that probably would make
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.560]   the demand higher if it were,
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.360]   as we've proven on the Southern border,
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.540]   if you ease the pathway, you create more demand.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.720]   Yeah, it's tough.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:45.720]   I think the biggest thing that we probably lose
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.760]   by not increasing that is this future founder thing
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.940]   that you're talking about.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:55.240]   And on one hand, it's kind of impossible to numerate
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.820]   like why that could be so huge.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.760]   But when you look at the legacy of immigrant founded
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.280]   companies in the Bay Area and the head count
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.200]   that's now under those companies,
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.480]   it's almost impossible not to believe.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:11.200]   And why wouldn't you want that aperture bigger?
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.920]   - Well, there's also the argument of okay,
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.120]   this is just a Silicon Valley thing.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.400]   And I mean, clearly it's not like,
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.780]   so we all know it's not.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:21.680]   But like, even if you wanted to prove that it's not,
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.520]   Silicon Valley, well, we're gonna literally run out
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.400]   of real estate, okay?
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.920]   So like, and room, we know that.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.740]   So guess what?
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.520]   If I'm a freaking town in anywhere in the country,
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.800]   and I could just be like, what?
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.200]   I can create like 10,000 tech jobs if I just become,
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.480]   if I'm able to get this amazing talent
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.800]   and they're all gonna move here.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.460]   Like, this is totally a country wide opportunity for us.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.880]   And we're just sitting on this and not doing anything about
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.800]   and I think it's insane.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.080]   So yeah.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.520]   - You know, this really comes down to the question
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.960]   of whether we have the will, right?
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.920]   To increase the quota of legal immigrants.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.840]   Again, we're talking about legal immigrants
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.800]   who companies want to hire in order to drive our economy.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.960]   To your point, Aaron, we're effectively,
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.280]   you're shipping your GDP to Poland.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.880]   That would be US GDP.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.340]   Instead, it's the GDP of Poland
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:14.940]   because it's workers in Poland who are doing the work
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.480]   that you can't hire to be done here.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.400]   And Bill, you make the point about,
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:23.400]   it's hard to enumerate what we won't have started,
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.360]   the counterfactual of the companies that won't be started.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:29.160]   But I look at just the acceleration generally,
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.680]   the moment we live in, we just talked about,
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.660]   the acceleration around AI.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.560]   This is not just about economic advantage.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.780]   This is about national security.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.160]   This is about national strategic advantage, right?
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.400]   That we have these things invented here, right?
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.400]   Again, we're lucky that Chad GPT was invented here,
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.580]   the open AI is here, that Anthropic is here,
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:53.960]   but that's not a given.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.540]   And the best way, and this has been a source
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.080]   of our national strategic advantage
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.020]   for hundreds of years, right?
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.240]   And Bill pinged me this morning and he said,
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.840]   it reminds me of this speech that Reagan gave,
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.660]   his last speech in office.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:16.100]   - To be fair, I found it on the Twitters, but keep going.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.040]   - Maybe we'll play it here, play it here,
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.560]   and then we'll end with all three of us
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.700]   by just rapping in reaction to the video.
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:29.200]   - It is that lady who gives us our great
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.520]   and special place in the world.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.880]   For it's the great life force of each generation
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.120]   of new Americans that guarantees that America's triumph
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.700]   shall continue unsurpassed into the next century and beyond.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:45.420]   Other countries may seek to compete with us,
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.320]   but in one vital area as a beacon of freedom
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.800]   and opportunity that draws the people of the world,
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.580]   no country on earth comes close.
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:58.720]   This I believe is one of the most important sources
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.720]   of America's greatness.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.720]   We lead the world because unique among nations,
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.440]   we draw our people, our strength from every country
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.640]   and every corner of the world.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.880]   - You know, you can't say it better than that.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:18.380]   And you know, you look at what it's given us, right?
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:21.680]   You know, I came of age in 1978
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.680]   when the Japanese were devastating our auto industry,
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.800]   where the view in the country was that our best days
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.640]   were behind us.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.640]   I grew up in a place that people referred to
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.860]   as the Rust Belt.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.760]   We didn't have really venture capital.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.240]   We, you know, the innovations around technology
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.640]   were just starting.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.440]   And, you know, and so I think about,
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.880]   we now have such great global advantage in technology.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.160]   The only way, right, in which we give way on that
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.200]   is to shoot the golden goose.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.600]   And part of the equation, you know,
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.160]   the most important part is the human talent
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.560]   and desire to start the next thing,
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.520]   to invent the next thing.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.680]   And I think you pointed out something
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.080]   incredibly important, Aaron, which is yes,
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.720]   we need to solve the illegal immigrant crisis
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.120]   on the Southern border.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.320]   But, you know, we really do need to focus
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.640]   on how we continue to be the place
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.600]   that all the best entrepreneurs on the planet,
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.600]   the best technologists on the planet
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.360]   wanna come start the next company.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.360]   Well, Aaron, thanks for being here.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.040]   You know, one of the reasons Bill and I wanted to,
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.600]   you know, to do a pod wasn't just to hear each other,
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.560]   but was really to tap into the people we admire,
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.160]   the big thinkers in Silicon Valley, you know,
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.800]   kicking around with them on occasion.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.480]   So really appreciate you taking the time
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.560]   and doing this today.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.560]   - I look forward to when those people join the pod,
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.040]   so I'll tune in for that one.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:49.960]   - Thank you.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.000]   - But thanks for having me.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.840]   I appreciate it.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.640]   And good luck on the charts.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.240]   (upbeat music)
