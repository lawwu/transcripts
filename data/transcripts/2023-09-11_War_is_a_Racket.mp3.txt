[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:38.100]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.900]   My name is Joshua Sheets. I am your host.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.700]   And today on the show, I want to talk with you about one of those big-picture financial topics.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.900]   It's not about personal finance.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.900]   It is, however, about how the world works.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.900]   And I think it's important that you and I pay attention to these things when they come across our desks.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:10.400]   I watched today on Twitter, I watched a comment from Senator McConnell, the United States Senator, a comment that he made here on Twitter.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.800]   I want to read it to you. Published September 7, 2023 at 1044 AM from Leader McConnell in the United States Senate.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.000]   Quote, "Standing with our allies against Russian aggression isn't charity.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.700]   In fact, it's a direct investment in replenishing America's arsenal with American weapons built by American workers.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.400]   Expanding our defense industrial base puts America in a stronger position to out-compete China."
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:53.300]   Now, this particular Twitter comment to me is rather shocking because it seems like a textbook example of what we sometimes refer to as saying the quiet part out loud.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:03.400]   And I thought, you know, there is a very important essay that I have thought about for many years, read many years ago, probably reread it at least every couple of years or so.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.600]   I've talked about it on the show, but I've never read to you.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.100]   And I believe this is one of the more useful essays for you to have in the back of your mind.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.900]   You see, current events are hard to parse through.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.600]   They're confusing, hard to figure out, etc.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.700]   But sometimes you can look back at history and by seeing what has happened in history, you can understand your present day a little bit more clearly.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.200]   The essay I want to read you is called War is a Racket.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:43.300]   This is a fairly well-known essay by Major General Smedley Butler, a long ago retired United States Marine Corps Major General.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:59.500]   And what is interesting about General Butler, Major General Butler, is that he is one of those men who was incredibly decorated, very highly placed in the overall military.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:14.600]   Reading from his Wikipedia entry, Major General Smedley Darlington Butler, July 30, 1881 to June 21, 1940, nicknamed the Maverick Marine, was a senior United States Marine Corps officer.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.100]   During his 34-year career, he fought in the Philippine-American War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Mexican Revolution, and World War I.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.600]   At the time of his death, Butler was the most decorated Marine in U.S. history.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:38.000]   By the end of his career, so I repeat that in case you missed it, at the time of his death, Butler was the most decorated Marine in U.S. history.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.500]   By the end of his career, Butler had received 16 medals, including five for heroism.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:52.900]   He is the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal, as well as two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:09.000]   In 1933, I'll skip the other controversies, after Butler retired from the military, he became well-known for giving a speech and for a pamphlet that he wrote called "War is a Racket."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.800]   It's a speech in a 1935 short book that he wrote and published, and it talks about what war is.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.200]   And without further ado, let me just read this to you so that you understand.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:31.000]   And I want you to have Leader McConnell's tweet in the back of your mind as I read this to you.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.100]   Chapter one, "War is a Racket."
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.300]   War is a racket. It always has been.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.400]   It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.600]   It is the only one international in scope.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.500]   It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.200]   A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.700]   Only a small inside group knows what it is about.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.900]   It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the very many.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.100]   Out of war, a few people make huge fortunes.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.700]   In the World War, meaning of course World War I, in the World War, a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.000]   At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That many admitted their huge blood games in their income tax returns.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.900]   How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns? No one knows.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.800]   How many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle?
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.600]   How many of them dug a trench?
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.300]   How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat-infested dugout?
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.200]   How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.500]   How many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy?
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.900]   How many of them were wounded or killed in battle?
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.000]   Out of war, nations acquire additional territory if they are victorious.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.600]   They just take it.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   This newly acquired territory promptly is exploited by the few.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.100]   The selfsame few who wrung dollars out of blood in the war.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.900]   The general public shoulders the bill.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.000]   And what is this bill?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.900]   This bill renders a horrible accounting.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:38.500]   Newly placed gravestones, mangled bodies, shattered minds, broken hearts and homes.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:49.900]   Economic instability, depression and all its attendant miseries. Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.100]   For a great many years as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.300]   Not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.300]   Now that I see the international war clouds gathering as they are today, I must face it and speak out.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.500]   Again, they are choosing sides.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.300]   France and Russia met and agreed to stand side by side.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.300]   Italy and Austria hurried to make a similar agreement.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.100]   Poland and Germany cast sheep's eyes at each other,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.700]   forgetting for the nonce, meaning one unique occasion, their dispute over the Polish corridor.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.000]   The assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia complicated matters.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.400]   Yugoslavia and Hungary, long bitter enemies, were almost at each other's throats.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.300]   Italy was ready to jump in, but France was waiting.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.400]   So was Czechoslovakia. All of them are looking ahead to war.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.000]   Not the people, not those who fight and pay and die.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Only those who foment wars and remain safely at home to profit.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.200]   There are 40 million men under arms in the world today,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.000]   and our statesmen and diplomats have the temerity to say that war is not in the making.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.300]   Hell's bells. Are these 40 million men being trained to be dancers?
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.900]   Not in Italy, to be sure. Premier Mussolini knows what they are being trained for.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.800]   He at least is frank enough to speak out.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.600]   Only the other day, Il Duche in International Conciliation,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.400]   the publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.000]   "And above all, fascism, the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.800]   quite apart from political considerations of the moment, believes neither in the possibility
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:44.900]   nor the utility of perpetual peace. War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.300]   and puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it."
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.600]   Undoubtedly, Mussolini means exactly what he says.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.400]   His well-trained army, his great fleet of planes, and even his navy are ready for war.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.600]   Anxious for it, apparently. His recent stand at the side of Hungary
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.500]   and the latter's dispute with Yugoslavia showed that.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.700]   And the hurried mobilization of his troops on the Austrian border
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.200]   after the assassination of Dolfuss showed it too.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:21.800]   There are others in Europe too whose saber-rattling presages war sooner or later.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.500]   Herr Hitler, with his rearming Germany and his constant demands for more and more arms,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.800]   is an equal, if not greater, menace to peace.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   France only recently increased the term of military service for its youth from a year to 18 months.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:45.300]   Yes, all over, nations are camping in their arms. The mad dogs of Europe are on the loose.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:53.800]   In the Orient, the maneuvering is more adroit. Back in 1904, when Russia and Japan fought,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.200]   we kicked out our old friends the Russians and backed Japan.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   Then our very generous international bankers were financing Japan.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.700]   Now the trend is to poison us against the Japanese.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.500]   What does the "open door" policy to China mean to us?
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.800]   Our trade with China is about 90 million dollars a year.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.000]   Or the Philippine Islands, we've spent about 600 million dollars in the Philippines in 35 years,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.100]   and we, our bankers and industrialists and speculators,
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.100]   have private investments there of less than 200 million dollars.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.500]   Then, to save that China trade of about 90 million dollars,
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.500]   or to protect these private investments of less than 200 million dollars in the Philippines,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.700]   we would be all stirred up to hate Japan and go to war.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.200]   A war that might well cost us tens of billions of dollars,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.700]   hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans,
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.100]   and many more hundreds of thousands of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.400]   Of course, for this loss, there would be a compensating profit.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.100]   Fortunes would be made.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.200]   Millions and billions of dollars would be piled up, by a few.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:09.000]   Munitions makers, bankers, shipbuilders, manufacturers, meatpackers, speculators.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.500]   They would fare well.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.800]   Yes, they are getting ready for another war.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   Why shouldn't they? It pays high dividends.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.100]   But what does it profit the men who are killed?
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.200]   What does it profit their mothers and sisters, their wives and their sweethearts?
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.300]   What does it profit their children?
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.600]   What does it profit anyone except the very few to whom war means huge profits?
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.200]   Yes.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.800]   And what does it profit the nation?
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.100]   Take our own case.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.700]   Until 1898, we didn't own a bit of territory outside the mainland of North America.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.600]   At that time, our national debt was a little more than one trillion dollars.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.000]   Then we became internationally minded.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.500]   We forgot or shunted aside the advice of the father of our country.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.200]   We forgot George Washington's warning about entangling alliances.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.600]   We went to war. We acquired outside territory.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.400]   At the end of the World War period, as a direct result of our fiddling in international affairs,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.500]   our national debt had jumped to over 25 trillion dollars.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:31.200]   Our total favorable trade balance during the 25-year period was about 24 billion dollars.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.300]   There should have been 1 billion dollars, 25 billion dollars, and 24 trillion dollars.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:41.100]   Our total favorable trade balance during the 25-year period was about 24 billion dollars.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.600]   Therefore, on a purely bookkeeping basis, we ran a little behind year for year.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.800]   And that foreign trade might well have been ours without the wars.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.900]   It would have been far cheaper, not to say safer, for the average American
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.100]   who pays the bills to stay out of foreign entanglements.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:03.200]   For a very few, this racket, like bootlegging and other underworld rackets, brings fancy profits.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:11.400]   But the cost of operations is always transferred to the people, who do not profit.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.900]   Chapter 2, Who Makes the Profits?
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:23.000]   The World War, rather our brief participation in it, has cost the United States some 52 billion dollars.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.200]   Figure it out.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   That means 400 dollars to every American man, woman, and child.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.300]   And we haven't paid the debt yet.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.600]   We are paying it.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.400]   Our children will pay it, and our children's children probably still will be paying the cost of that war.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:45.200]   The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are 6, 8, 10, and sometimes 12%.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.300]   But wartime profits, that is another matter.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.600]   20, 60, 100, 300, and even 1800%.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   The sky is the limit.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.500]   All that traffic will bear.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.300]   Uncle Sam has the money, let's get it.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.500]   Of course, it isn't put that crudely in wartime.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:13.700]   It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and we must all put our shoulders to the wheel.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:20.400]   But the profits jump and leap and skyrocket and are safely pocketed.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.600]   Let's just take a few examples.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.100]   Take our friends, the DuPonts, the powder people.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:34.800]   Didn't one of them testify before a Senate committee recently that their powder won the war, or saved the world for democracy, or something?
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   How did they do in the war?
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   They were a patriotic corporation.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.100]   Well, the average earnings of the DuPonts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6 million a year.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.500]   It wasn't much, but the DuPonts managed to get along on it.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:56.600]   Now let's look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.000]   $58 million a year profit, we find.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Nearly 10 times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.200]   An increase in profits of more than 950%.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:20.100]   Take one of our little steel companies that patriotically shunted aside the making of rails and girders and bridges to manufacture war materials.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:26.300]   Well, their 1910 to 1914 yearly earnings averaged $6 million.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:34.600]   Then came the war, and like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.800]   Did their profits jump, or did they let Uncle Sam in for a bargain?
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:46.200]   Well, their 1914 to 1918 average was $49 million a year.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.000]   Or let's take United States Steel.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.900]   The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.000]   Not bad.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.100]   Then along came the war, and up went the profits.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:06.500]   The average yearly profit for the period 1914 to 1918 was $240 million.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.300]   Not bad.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.200]   There you have some of the steel and powder earnings.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.800]   Let's look at something else, a little copper perhaps.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.000]   That always does well in war times.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.600]   Anaconda, for instance, average yearly earnings during the pre-war years, 1910 to 1914, of $10 million.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:31.500]   During the war years, 1914 to 1918, profits leaped to $34 million per year.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.800]   Or Utah Copper, average of $5 million per year during the 1910 to 1914 period,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.200]   jumped to an average of $21 million yearly profits for the war period.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.700]   Let's group these five with three smaller companies.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:52.600]   The total yearly average profits of the pre-war period, 1910 to 1914, were $137,480,000.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.400]   Then along came the war.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.700]   The average yearly profits for this group skyrocketed to $408,300,000,
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.100]   a little increase in profits of approximately 200%.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.700]   Does war pay?
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.000]   They paid them.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.100]   But they aren't the only ones.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.600]   There are still others.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.200]   Let's take leather.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.400]   For the three-year period before the war, the total profits of Central Leather Company were $3.5 million.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.700]   That was approximately $1,167,000 a year.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:31.000]   Well, in 1916, Central Leather returned a profit of $15 million, a small increase of 1,100%.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.400]   That's all.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.800]   The General Chemical Company averaged a profit for the three years before the war of a little over $800,000 a year.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:45.100]   Came the war and the profits jumped to $12 million, a leap of 1,400%.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.900]   International Nickel Company, and you can't have a war without nickel,
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:57.300]   showed an increase in profits from a mere average of $4 million a year to $73 million yearly.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.500]   Not bad.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.700]   An increase of more than 1,700%.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.500]   American Sugar Refining Company averaged $2 million a year for the three years before the war.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.600]   In 1916, a profit of $6 million was recorded.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:19.500]   Listen to Senate Document No. 259, the 65th Congress, reporting on corporate earnings and government revenues.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:30.900]   Considering the profits of 122 meat packers, 153 cotton manufacturers, 299 garment makers, 49 steel plants, and 340 coal producers during the war,
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.800]   profits under 25% were exceptional.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:44.600]   For instance, the coal companies made between 100% and 7,856% on their capital stock during the war.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   The Chicago Packers doubled and tripled their earnings.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.200]   And let us not forget the bankers who financed the Great War.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.400]   If anyone had the cream of the profits, it was the bankers.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.900]   And their profits were as secret as they were immense.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.200]   How the bankers made their millions and their billions, I do not know.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:16.900]   Because those little secrets never become public, even before a Senate investigatory body.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:22.600]   But here's how some of the other patriotic industrialists and speculators chiseled their way into war profits.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.400]   Take the shoe people.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   They like war.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.400]   It brings business with abnormal profits.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.600]   They made huge profits on sales abroad to our allies.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:39.000]   Perhaps like the munitions manufacturers and armament makers, they also sold to the enemy.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   For a dollar is a dollar, whether it comes from Germany or from France.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.600]   But they did well by Uncle Sam, too.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.800]   For instance, they sold Uncle Sam 35 million pairs of hobnailed service shoes.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.900]   There were 4 million soldiers, 8 pairs and more to a soldier.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.300]   My regiment during the war had only one pair to a soldier.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   Some of these shoes probably are still in existence.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   They were good shoes.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:13.100]   But when the war was over, Uncle Sam has a matter of 25 million pairs left over, bought and paid for.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.000]   Profits recorded and pocketed.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.500]   There was still lots of leather left.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:24.800]   So the leather people sold your Uncle Sam hundreds of thousands of McClellan saddles for the cavalry.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.700]   But there wasn't any American cavalry overseas.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.800]   Somebody had to get rid of this leather, however.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.000]   Somebody had to make a profit in it.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So we had a lot of McClellan saddles.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.500]   And we probably have those yet.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.800]   Also, somebody had a lot of mosquito netting.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.100]   They sold your Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito nets for the use of the soldiers overseas.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.000]   I suppose the boys were expected to put it over them as they tried to sleep in muddy trenches,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.200]   one hand scratching cooties on their backs and the other making passes at scurrying rats.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.500]   Well, not one of those mosquito nets ever got to France.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:06.000]   Anyhow, these thoughtful manufacturers wanted to make sure that no soldier would be without his mosquito net.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.400]   So 40 million additional yards of mosquito netting were sold to Uncle Sam.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.100]   There were pretty good profits in mosquito netting in those days, even if there were no mosquitoes in France.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.100]   I suppose if the war had lasted just a little longer,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:27.900]   the enterprising mosquito netting manufacturers would have sold your Uncle Sam a couple of consignments of mosquitoes to plant in France,
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.100]   so that more mosquito netting would be in order.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:38.500]   Airplane and engine manufacturers felt they too should get their just profits out of this war.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.800]   Why not? Everybody else was getting theirs.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:51.600]   So $1 billion, count them if you live long enough, was spent by Uncle Sam in building airplane engines that never left the ground.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:58.500]   Not one plane or motor out of the billion dollars worth ordered ever got into a battle in France.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.700]   Just the same, the manufacturers made their little profit of 30, 100 or perhaps 300 percent.
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:12.100]   Undershirts for soldiers cost 14 cents to make, and Uncle Sam paid 30 cents to 40 cents each for them.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:18.800]   A nice little profit for the undershirt manufacturer, and the stocking manufacturer, and the uniform manufacturers,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.600]   and the cap manufacturers, and the steel helmet manufacturers all got theirs.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:34.200]   Why, when the war was over, some 4 million sets of equipment, knapsacks and the things that go to fill them, crammed warehouses on this side.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.100]   Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have changed the contents.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:46.900]   But the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them, and they will do it all over again the next time.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.600]   There were lots of brilliant ideas for profit making during the war.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:57.800]   One very versatile patriot sold Uncle Sam 12 dozen 48 inch wrenches.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.500]   They were very nice wrenches.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:07.700]   The only trouble was that there was only one nut ever made that was large enough for these wrenches.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.700]   That is the one that holds the turbines at Niagara Falls.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.300]   Well, after Uncle Sam had bought them and the manufacturer had pocketed the profit,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:24.900]   the wrenches were put on freight cars and shunted all around the United States in an effort to find a use for them.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:30.400]   When the armistice was signed, it was indeed a sad blow to the wrench manufacturer.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.800]   He was just about to make some nuts to fit the wrenches.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.300]   Then he planned to sell these two to your Uncle Sam.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:46.900]   Still another had the brilliant idea that colonels shouldn't ride in automobiles, nor should they even ride on horseback.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.900]   One has probably seen a picture of Andy Jackson riding in a buck board.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.700]   Well, some 6000 buck boards were sold to Uncle Sam for the use of colonels.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:03.400]   Not one of them was used, but the buck board manufacturer got his war profit.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.500]   The shipbuilders felt they should come in on some of it, too.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.300]   They built a lot of ships that made a lot of profit.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.600]   More than $3 billion worth. Some of the ships were all right,
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   but $635 million worth of them were made of wood and wouldn't float.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.700]   The seams opened up and they sank.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.000]   We paid for them, though, and somebody pocketed the profits.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   It has been estimated by statisticians and economists and researchers that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52 billion.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.300]   Of this sum, $39 billion was expended in the actual war itself.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.400]   This expenditure yielded $16 billion in profits.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.100]   That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.600]   This $16 billion of profits is not to be sneezed at.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.800]   It is quite a tidy sum, and it went to a very few.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:07.200]   The Senate, nigh committee, probe of the munitions industry and its wartime profits,
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.000]   despite its sensational disclosures, hardly has scratched the surface.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.100]   Even so, it has had some effect.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:22.400]   The State Department has been studying for some time methods of keeping out of war.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.100]   The War Department suddenly decides it has a wonderful plan to spring.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:33.500]   The administration names a committee with the War and Navy Departments ably represented
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:40.000]   under the chairmanship of a Wall Street speculator to limit profits in wartime.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.700]   To what extent isn't suggested.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:53.200]   Possibly the profits of 300 and 600 and 1,600 percent of those who turned blood into gold
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.600]   in the World War would be limited to some smaller figure.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.800]   Apparently, however, the plan does not call for any limitation of losses.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.600]   That is, the losses of those who fight the war.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   As far as I have been able to ascertain, there is nothing in the scheme to limit a soldier
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:22.200]   to the loss of but one eye or one arm, or to limit his wounds to one or two or three,
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.500]   or to limit the loss of life.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:30.000]   There is nothing in this scheme, apparently, that says not more than 12 percent of a regiment
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.800]   shall be wounded in battle, or that not more than 7 percent in a division shall be killed.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:44.700]   Of course, the committee cannot be bothered with such trifling matters.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.880]   Chapter 3.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.240]   Who Pays the Bills?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:55.600]   Who provides the profits, the nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500, and 1,800
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   percent?
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.760]   We all pay them in taxation.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.840]   We paid the bankers their profits when we bought Liberty Bonds at $100 and sold them
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.880]   back at $84 or $86 to the bankers.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.600]   These bankers collected $100 plus.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.520]   It was a simple manipulation.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.760]   The bankers controlled the security marts.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.160]   It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:26.520]   Then all of us, the people, got frightened and sold the bonds at $84 or $86.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.100]   The bankers bought them.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.380]   Then these same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par and above.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.160]   Then the bankers collected their profits.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.640]   But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.680]   If you don't believe this, visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad, or
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.240]   visit any of the veterans' hospitals in the United States.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.880]   On a tour of the country, in the midst of which I am at the time of this writing, I
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.560]   have visited 18 government hospitals for veterans.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:06.360]   Among them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men, men who were the pick of the nation 18
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.840]   years ago.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.720]   The very able chief surgeon at the government hospital at Milwaukee, where there are 3,800
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.580]   of the living dead, told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.540]   among those who stayed at home.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.720]   Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the fields and offices and factories and
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.440]   classrooms and put into the ranks.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.200]   There they were remolded.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.000]   They were made over.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.200]   They were made to about face, to regard murder as the order of the day.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:48.720]   They were put shoulder to shoulder and through mass psychology, they were entirely changed.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:56.400]   We used them for a couple of years and trained them to think nothing at all of killing or
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.600]   of being killed.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.360]   Then suddenly we discharged them and told them to make another about face.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:09.480]   This time they had to do their own readjustment, sans mass psychology, sans officers aid and
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.080]   advice and sans nationwide propaganda.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.400]   We didn't need them anymore.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:23.800]   So we scattered them about without any three minute or liberty loan speeches or parades.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:33.560]   Many, too many of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed mentally because they
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.640]   could not make that final about face alone.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:46.680]   In the government hospital in Marion, Indiana, 1,800 of these boys are in pens, 500 of them
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:52.660]   in a barracks with steel bars and wires all around outside the buildings and on the porches.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.560]   These already have been mentally destroyed.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.920]   These boys don't even look like human beings.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   Looks on their faces.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.720]   Physically, they're in good shape.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.480]   Mentally they are gone.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.360]   There are thousands and thousands of these cases and more and more are coming in all
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   the time.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:18.960]   The tremendous excitement of the war, the sudden cutting off of that excitement, the
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.000]   young boys couldn't stand it.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.120]   That's a part of the bill.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.320]   So much for the dead.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.420]   They have paid their part of the war profits.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.840]   So much for the mentally and physically wounded.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.180]   They are paying now their share of the war profits.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.300]   But the others paid, too.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.320]   They paid with heartbreaks when they tore themselves away from their firesides and their
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.700]   families to don the uniform of Uncle Sam on which a profit had been made.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.420]   They paid another part in the training camps where they were regimented and drilled while
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.460]   others took their jobs and their places in the lives of their communities.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:02.820]   They paid for it in the trenches where they shot and were shot, where they were hungry
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:09.340]   for days at a time, where they slept in the mud and the cold and in the rain with the
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:14.260]   moans and shrieks of the dying for a horrible lullaby.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:20.460]   But don't forget, the soldier paid part of the dollars and cents bills, too.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:27.260]   Up to and including the Spanish-American War, we had a prize system, and soldiers and sailors
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.500]   fought for money.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:35.300]   During the Civil War, they were paid bonuses, in many instances before they went into service.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:41.600]   The government or states paid as high as $1,200 for an enlistment.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.500]   In the Spanish-American War, they gave prize money.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.140]   When we captured any vessels, the soldiers all got their share, or at least they were
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.820]   supposed to.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.380]   Then it was found that we could reduce the cost of wars by taking all the prize money
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:00.740]   and keeping it, but conscripting the soldier anyway.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.020]   Then soldiers couldn't bargain for their labor.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.500]   Everyone else could bargain, but the soldier couldn't.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   Napoleon once said, "All men are enamored of decorations.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.940]   They positively hunger for them."
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.220]   So by developing the Napoleonic system, the medal business, the government learned it
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.580]   could get soldiers for less money because the boys liked to be decorated.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.780]   Until the Civil War, there were no medals.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.520]   Then the Congressional Medal of Honor was handed out.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.340]   It made enlistments easier.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:44.180]   After the Civil War, no new medals were issued until the Spanish-American War.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.420]   In the World War, we used propaganda to make the boys accept conscription.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.440]   They were made to feel ashamed if they didn't join the army.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.060]   So vicious was this war propaganda that even God was brought into it.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.260]   With few exceptions, our clergymen joined in the clamor to kill, kill, kill, to kill
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.260]   the Germans.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.180]   "God is on our side.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.560]   It is his will that the Germans be killed."
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.700]   And in Germany, the good pastors called upon the Germans to kill the allies to please the
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.180]   same God.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.340]   That was a part of the general propaganda built up to make people war-conscious and
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.900]   murder-conscious.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.820]   Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die.
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.840]   This was the war to end all wars.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.900]   This was the war to make the world safe for democracy.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:44.180]   No one mentioned to them as they marched away that their going and their dying would mean
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.980]   huge war profits.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:52.220]   No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.300]   own brothers here.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.780]   No one told them that the ships on which they were going to cross might be torpedoed by
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.060]   submarines built with United States patents.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.900]   They were just told it was to be a glorious adventure.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:13.860]   Thus, having stuffed patriotism down their throats, it was decided to make them help
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.900]   pay for the war too.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.140]   So we gave them the large salary of $30 a month.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:25.020]   All they had to do for this munificent sum was to leave their dear ones behind, give
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.380]   up their jobs, lie in swampy trenches, eat canned willy when they could get it, and kill
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.420]   and kill and kill and be killed.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.100]   But wait!
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.500]   Half of that wage, just a little more than a riveter in a shipyard or a laborer in a
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.900]   munitions factory safe at home made in a day, was promptly taken from him to support his
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:51.380]   dependents, so that they would not become a charge upon his community.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.340]   Then we made him pay what amounted to accident insurance, something the employer pays for
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:01.180]   in an enlightened state, and that cost him $6 a month.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.540]   He had less than $9 a month left.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:11.500]   Then the most crowning insolence of all, he was virtually blackjacked into paying for
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:18.740]   his own ammunition, clothing, and food by being made to buy liberty bonds.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.420]   Most soldiers got no money at all on paydays.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:27.460]   We made them buy liberty bonds at $100, and then we bought them back when they came back
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:33.780]   from the war and couldn't find work at $84 and $86.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:38.820]   And the soldiers bought about $2 billion worth of these bonds.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:44.100]   Yes, the soldier pays the greater part of the bill.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.140]   His family pays too.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.300]   They pay it in the same heartbreak that he does.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.940]   As he suffers, they suffer.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:59.060]   At nights as he lay in the trenches and watched shrapnel burst about him, they lay home in
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:06.620]   their beds and tossed sleeplessly, his father, his mother, his wife, his sisters, his brothers,
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.260]   his sons, and his daughters.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:16.940]   When he returned home minus an eye or minus a leg or with his mind broken, they suffered
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.580]   too, as much as and even sometimes more than he.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:27.180]   Yes, and they too contributed their dollars to the profits of the munitions makers and
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.860]   bankers and shipbuilders and the manufacturers and the speculators made.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.660]   They too bought liberty bonds and contributed to the profit of the bankers after the armistice
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:42.940]   and the hocus pocus of manipulated liberty bond prices.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.780]   And even now, the families of the wounded men and of the mentally broken and those who
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:54.420]   never were able to readjust themselves are still suffering and still paying.

[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.700]   Chapter 4 How to Smash This Racket
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.660]   Well, it's a racket, alright.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.300]   A few profit and the many pay.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.320]   But there is a way to stop it.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.100]   You can't end it by disarmament conferences.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.780]   You can't eliminate it by peace parlays at Geneva.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.160]   Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:01.000]   It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.720]   The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before the
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.060]   nation's manhood can be conscripted.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.440]   One month before the government can conscript the young men of the nation, it must conscript
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.080]   capital and industry and labor.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.820]   Let the officers and the directors and the high-powered executives of our armament factories
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:27.560]   and our munitions makers and our shipbuilders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.480]   of all the other things that provide profit in wartime, as well as the bankers and the
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:39.640]   speculators, be conscripted to get $30 a month, the same wage as the lads in the trenches
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   get.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.740]   Let the workers in these plants get the same wage as all the workers, all presidents, all
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.840]   executives, all directors, all managers, all bankers, yes, and all generals and all admirals
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.360]   and all officers and all politicians and all government office holders, everyone in the
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.560]   nation be restricted to a total monthly income not to exceed that paid to the soldier in
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   the trenches.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.920]   Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers in industry
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.400]   and all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $30 wage to their
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.720]   families and pay war risk insurance and buy liberty bonds.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.480]   Why shouldn't they?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.200]   They aren't running any risk of being killed or of having their bodies mangled or their
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.560]   minds shattered.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.160]   They aren't sleeping in muddy trenches.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   They aren't hungry.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.120]   The soldiers are.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.880]   Give capital and industry and labor 30 days to think it over and you will find by that
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.400]   time there will be no war.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.800]   They will smash the war racket.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.540]   That and nothing else.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.920]   Maybe I am a little too optimistic.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.840]   Capital still has some say.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   So capital won't permit the taking of the profit out of war until the people, those
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.280]   who do the suffering and still pay the price, make up their minds that those they elect
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.020]   to office shall do their bidding and not that of the profiteers.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:07.360]   Another step necessary in this fight to smash the war racket is the limited plebiscite to
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.160]   determine whether a war should be declared.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.920]   A plebiscite not of all the voters but merely of those who would be called upon to do the
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.480]   fighting and dying.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   There wouldn't be very much sense in having a 76-year-old president of a munitions factory
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:29.120]   or the flat-footed head of an international banking firm or the cross-eyed manager of
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:34.080]   a uniform manufacturing plant, all of whom see visions of tremendous profits in the event
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.540]   of war, voting on whether the nation should go to war or not.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:44.100]   They never would be called upon to shoulder arms, to sleep in a trench, and to be shot.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.280]   Only those who would be called upon to risk their lives for their country should have
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.800]   the privilege of voting to determine whether the nation should go to war.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.720]   There is ample precedent for restricting the voting to those affected.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.480]   Many of our states have restrictions on those permitted to vote.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.080]   In most, it is necessary to be able to read and write before you may vote.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.560]   In some, you must own property.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.640]   It would be a simple matter each year for the men coming of military age to register
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:16.900]   in their communities as they did in the draft during the World War and be examined physically.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.680]   Those who could pass, and who would therefore be called upon to bear arms in the event of
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   war, would be eligible to vote in a limited plebiscite.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.600]   They should be the ones to have the power to decide, and not a Congress, few of whose
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.920]   members are within the age limit, and fewer still of whom are in physical condition to
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.680]   bear arms.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:41.840]   Only those who must suffer should have the right to vote.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.640]   A third step in this business of smashing the war racket is to make certain that our
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.920]   military forces are truly forces for defense only.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.340]   At each session of Congress, the question of further naval appropriations comes up.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.760]   The swivel chair admirals of Washington, and there are always a lot of them, are very adroit
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.040]   lobbyists, and they are smart.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.160]   They don't shout that "we need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation."
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.800]   Oh no.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:14.040]   First of all, they let it be known that America is menaced by a great naval power.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.000]   Almost any day, these admirals will tell you, the great fleet of this supposed enemy will
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.460]   strike suddenly and annihilate 125 million people just like that.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.120]   Then they begin to cry for a larger navy.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   For what?
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   To fight the enemy?
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.320]   Oh my no.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.400]   Oh no.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.920]   For defense purposes only.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:41.440]   Then incidentally, they announce maneuvers in the Pacific for defense.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.560]   The Pacific is a great big ocean.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.920]   We have a tremendous coastline on the Pacific.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.080]   Will the maneuvers be off the coast, two or three hundred miles?
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.960]   Oh no.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.440]   The maneuvers will be two thousand, yes, perhaps even thirty-five hundred miles off the coast.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:07.160]   The Japanese, a proud people of course, will be pleased beyond expression to see the United
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.560]   States fleet so close to Nippon's shores.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.160]   Even as pleased as would be the residents of California were they to dimly discern through
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:24.280]   the morning mist the Japanese fleet playing at war games off Los Angeles.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.680]   The ships of our navy, it can be seen, should be specifically limited by law to within two
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.720]   hundred miles of our coastline.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.600]   Had that been the law in 1898, the Maine would never have gone to Havana Harbor.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.400]   She never would have been blown up.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.320]   There would have been no war with Spain with its attendant loss of life.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.040]   Two hundred miles is ample in the opinion of experts for defense purposes.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.000]   Our nation cannot start an offensive war if its ships can't go further than two hundred
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.160]   miles from the coastline.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.880]   Planes might be permitted to go as far as five hundred miles from the coast for the
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.760]   purposes of reconnaissance, and the army should never leave the territorial limits of our
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.560]   nation.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.240]   To summarize, three steps must be taken to smash the war racket.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.760]   One, we must take the prophet out of war.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:22.360]   Two, we must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.320]   there should be war.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:35.640]   Three, we must limit our military forces to home defense purposes.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.000]   Chapter Five.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.120]   To Hell With War.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.260]   I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.200]   another war.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:55.920]   Going back, Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:01.880]   kept us out of war and on the implied promise that he would keep us out of war.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.840]   Yet five months later, he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.000]   In that five-month interval, the people had not been asked whether they had changed their
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.240]   minds.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.800]   The four million young men who put on uniforms and marched or sailed away were not asked
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   whether they wanted to go forth to suffer and die.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.120]   Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly?
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.760]   Money.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.560]   An allied commission, it may be recalled, came over shortly before the war declaration
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.400]   and called on the president.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.880]   The president summoned a group of advisors.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.120]   The head of the commission spoke.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:44.600]   Stripped of its diplomatic language, this is what he told the president and his group.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.920]   There is no use kidding ourselves any longer.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.440]   The cause of the allies is lost.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.400]   We now owe you, American bankers, American munitions makers, American manufacturers,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   American speculators, American exporters, five or six billion dollars.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.240]   If we lose, and without the help of the United States, we must lose, we, England, France,
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:08.000]   and Italy cannot pay back this money, and Germany won't.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:16.440]   So had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations were concerned, and had the press
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.400]   been invited to be present at that conference, or had radio been available to broadcast the
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.280]   proceedings, America never would have entered the World War.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.520]   But this conference, like all war discussions, was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.480]   When our boys were sent off to war, they were told it was a war to make the world safe for
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   democracy, and a war to end all wars.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:48.040]   Well, 18 years after, the world has less of democracy than it had then.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.320]   Besides, what business is it of ours whether Russia or Germany or England or France or
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:47:00.160]   Italy or Austria live under democracies or monarchies, whether they are fascists or communists?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.920]   Our problem is to preserve our own democracy.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.280]   And very little, if anything, has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.600]   the war to end all wars.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.800]   Yes, we have had disarmament conferences and limitations of arms conferences.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.680]   They don't mean a thing.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.120]   One has just failed.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.360]   The results of another have been nullified.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.680]   We send our professional soldiers and our sailors and our politicians and our diplomats
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.880]   to these conferences, and what happens?
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.680]   Professional soldiers and sailors don't want to disarm.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.040]   No admiral wants to be without a ship.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.720]   No general wants to be without a command.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.920]   Both mean men without jobs.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.000]   They are not for disarmament.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.960]   They cannot be for limitations of arms.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.720]   And at all these conferences, lurking in the background, but all powerful just the same,
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.360]   are the sinister agents of those who profit by war.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:01.160]   They see to it that these conferences do not disarm or seriously limit armaments.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.680]   The chief aim of any power at any of these conferences has not been to achieve disarmament
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:12.640]   to prevent war, but rather to get more armament for itself and less for any potential foe.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.720]   There is only one way to disarm with any semblance of practicability.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.760]   That is, for all nations to get together and scrap every ship, every gun, every rifle,
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.880]   every tank, every warplane.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.400]   Even this, if it were possible, would not be enough.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.280]   The next war, according to experts, will be fought not with battleships, not by artillery,
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.560]   not with rifles, and not with machine guns.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.760]   It will be fought with deadly chemicals and gases.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:43.360]   Secretly, each nation is studying and perfecting newer and ghastlier means of annihilating
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.160]   its foes wholesale.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.320]   Yes, ships will continue to be built, for the shipbuilders must make their profits.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.280]   And guns still will be manufactured, and powder and rifles will be made, for the munitions
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.160]   makers must make their huge profits.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.080]   And the soldiers, of course, must wear uniforms, for the manufacturer must make their war profits
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.080]   too.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:10.440]   But victory or defeat will be determined by the skill and ingenuity of our scientists.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   If we put them to work making poison gas and more and more fiendish mechanical and explosive
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.000]   instruments of destruction, they will have no time for the constructive job of building
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.920]   greater prosperity for all peoples.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.320]   By putting them to this useful job, we can all make more money out of peace than we can
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.800]   out of war, even the munitions makers.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:37.920]   So I say, to hell with war.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   Thus concludes Major General Butler's pamphlet and his speech.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:51.760]   It's hard for me to know what to say because here we are more than a hundred years later
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:50:02.800]   and you can see as well as I can what of his comments have held true and what hasn't.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.000]   Difficult issue is simply that we should pay attention to the details that we need to know
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   about.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:18.360]   But we should not delude ourselves by thinking that war is exclusively about what is right
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:24.720]   and wrong, nor should we delude ourselves to think that in most cases war is even primarily
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.920]   about what is right and wrong.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.040]   I myself don't know exactly where all those lines are drawn.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.520]   You look at some conflicts and the morality is clearer than in others.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:41.720]   I don't know exactly where you should draw the lines of each different thing.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:50.120]   All I know is that war is hell and it ought not to be profited on.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.320]   I don't want any money from it.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   I hope that you don't want any money from it.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.400]   But at the end of the day, the world is full of wicked men who are going to profit on war
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.840]   until righteous men stand up and say enough is enough.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.740]   I have no idea how to do that.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:12.520]   But I wanted to be faithful to wage my little protest here in the form of reading you this
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   essay.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:21.640]   As far as I'm concerned, this essay should be mandatory reading for every person, every
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.960]   citizen, every voter, every young person, every young man or woman, whoever wants to
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:33.400]   go and enlist in the military must read this essay first and then act accordingly.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:40.560]   I pray that God would give us wisdom of how to defend righteousness and justice and to
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:50.220]   eliminate wickedness and violence all over the world.
