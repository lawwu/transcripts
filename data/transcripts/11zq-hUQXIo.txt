[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   I should like to call your attention this evening to two phrases found in the passage
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.600]   that we read at the beginning of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:20.360]   And the first phrase is in chapter 4 in verse 31, and the second is in chapter 5 in verse
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   3.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:31.400]   The phrase in verse 31 of chapter 4 is this, "And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:43.840]   And in chapter 5 verse 3, Peter said, "Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   the Holy Ghost?"
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.040]   Now, those who attend here regularly will know we've been considering together this
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.360]   incident recorded here in chapter 5 of this Book of Acts concerning Ananias and Sapphira
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.640]   on the previous three Sunday evenings.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.920]   We come back to it again tonight, and I want to do so this evening, as I say, in the light
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.400]   of this statement which was made here by the Apostle Peter to Ananias, and which in a sense
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.040]   he repeated later in three hours' time to Ananias' wife, Sapphira.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.600]   I take that phrase and I put it by the side of that other phrase at the end there of chapter
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.960]   4.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.000]   Something that happened, you remember, after the church, the infant church, had prayed
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720]   to God in their dire circumstances.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.800]   When they had prayed, the place was shaken, where they were assembled together.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:49.000]   And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, filled with the Holy Ghost, heart filled by
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Satan.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.440]   Now, I take these two phrases and I put them together because I want to try to show you
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.120]   that they pinpoint, if I may so put it, the great message of the whole of the Bible.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.800]   They certainly bring to a focus the great message that we are intended surely to receive
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.040]   from this whole alarming and terrifying incident concerning Ananias and Sapphira.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.520]   I've already suggested to you, and it's important that we should keep this in our minds, that
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.120]   this thing took place here at the very beginning of the history of the Christian church in
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.640]   order that it might be a great kind of signpost, or monument, I don't care which you call
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.200]   it, but it inherits something that's there once and forever, directing our attention
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.720]   to certain fundamental truths.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.560]   All that you get in the early chapters of this book of the Acts of the Apostle, all
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.760]   of that of course does the same thing.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.440]   That's what it's there for.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.560]   It's there that you and I might know what Christianity is.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.280]   See, that's the whole trouble in the world, that people don't know what it is.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   They look at something that calls itself Christianity but which, as I've been trying to show you,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.960]   doesn't have the remotest connection with what we find here.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.840]   And that's the cause of the whole trouble.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   But here we have the authentic account, here is genuine, true Christianity.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   And in every period of reformation and revival, what the church, what has happened to the
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.960]   church always is that she's returned to this and has repeated this, showing that that and
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.200]   that alone is true Christianity.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.720]   Now, my basic proposition is, I'm here to say that it is the basic proposition of the
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:48.240]   whole Bible, that the whole story of the human race of mankind is only rarely understood
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:58.200]   in the light of this fact, that there are two great forces and powers operating upon
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:08.720]   us in this world, and that what is true of us and what is true of the world depends solely
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.400]   upon the preponderance of the one or the other of those two powers.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.080]   The message of the Bible can be put, therefore, like this, that either Satan fills our hearts
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.600]   or else the Holy Ghost fills our hearts, and it's one or the other, there are no other
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   possibilities.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.240]   That is what makes the message of this book so wonderful and so glorious, it simplifies
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   the problem.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.760]   It brings us at once to this crucial point.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.160]   Now, as I've been trying to show, the whole tragedy of the modern world is that it doesn't
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360]   begin to realize this at all.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.360]   You see, we will persist in treating the human problem in terms of our human understanding,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.480]   what we think about it, what other people are thinking and saying, but it's all as man.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.840]   It's regarded as a human problem, and man alone, therefore, is to solve it.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.400]   But we see that far from solving it, it gets worse and worse.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.080]   And the whole tragedy, I say, is due to this, our failure to realize, speaking generally,
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   and this is true, of course, of all who are not Christians, the failure to realize that
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.960]   the problem is not a human problem, it's this great problem, it's a spiritual problem.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.220]   It's this mighty conflict between these two powers, the power of God, the power of Satan,
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.840]   the power of the devil.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.640]   Now here, as we've been seeing, and as I want to show you, I trust in a still more pointed
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.940]   manner this evening, here, in this one incident, in a very dramatic way, which we can never
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.080]   forget again, I'm certain any one of us who's ever really heard this story or who's ever
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.440]   read it with real understanding, here, I say, the whole thing is depicted before us.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.000]   We see the two forces, we see their character, their nature, we see what they do, we see
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.320]   the results which they invariably and always produce.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   And my dear friends, there is nothing more important for any one of us in this congregation
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:30.480]   at this moment than just this question, to know whether my heart is filled by Satan,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.280]   or whether it is filled by and with the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.480]   Nothing matters but that.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.640]   This is the great message of the Scripture.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:51.040]   The whole Bible, I say, is in a sense just a record of this mighty cosmic conflict between
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.640]   God and his forces, and the devil and his forces.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.680]   And in this book you are shown the whole conflict from the beginning right until the final end
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   and consolation.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.160]   That's what the Bible is about, that's what Christianity is about.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.440]   Now then, let's look at it together.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.640]   We have dealt with many aspects of this story, let me just concentrate on this, let's look
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   at these two forces.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.720]   Take first this power that Peter refers to in addressing Ananias, "Ananias, why hath
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.200]   Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?"
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.480]   You remember what he did.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.120]   He and his wife, hearing that other people in the church, good people, feeling for one
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.520]   another and anxious to help one another, had sold their goods and possessions, lands and
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   houses, and had brought the money and had given the proceeds to the apostles for distribution.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.520]   This excellent man, Joseph, who became known as Barnabas, he had land in Cyprus where he
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.120]   came from, he sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.320]   But they decided that they'd do something much cleverer than that.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.440]   They'd give the impression that they'd done that, but in reality they were not going to
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.800]   do that.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.480]   They sold their possessions, but instead of giving the whole of the money they kept that
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.720]   part of it and only gave a part of it.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.560]   So they were getting the best of both worlds.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.160]   They were getting all the praise that the others were getting and so on, and still they'd
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.080]   kept back enough for themselves.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.840]   You remember the story, the miserable, the sad story, the typical story of the human
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   race.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.240]   Now then, Peter says there's only one explanation of this, "Why hath Satan filled thine heart
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.680]   to do this?"
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.760]   Let's look at this tremendous power.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.920]   We are told a great deal about him in the Bible.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.560]   As I say, you don't begin to understand the story of the human race, apart from understanding
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.620]   something about this.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:07.880]   You notice that Peter immediately concentrates on his great characteristic, "Why hath Satan
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.560]   filled thine heart to lie?"
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.400]   I'm not going to keep you this evening in telling you or reminding you of what the Bible
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.440]   tells us about the devil.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:27.720]   The teaching of the Bible is that he was created a perfect being, a bright angelic being, unusually
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:34.160]   gifted with wisdom and understanding, given great authority and power, but he lifted up
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.520]   his heart, as the Bible puts it, against God, became jealous of God, he rebelled against
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.200]   God, he resented that he was under God, that he was a created being.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:51.160]   He wanted to be a god, so he fell, and ever since he's been a bitter, hating enemy of
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.240]   God, and his whole ambition is to mar everything that God does, and to bring it to disrepute
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240]   and to ruin.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.520]   There he is, the enemy of God, and his great characteristic, this is the thing we are concentrating
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:15.640]   on tonight, is that he always produces a lie, "Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie?"
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:21.200]   Now, we have the authority of our Lord himself for saying that this is the great characteristic
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.840]   of the devil.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.200]   You remember how one day he was preaching and certain Jews were arguing with him as
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.760]   to who he was and so on, and our Lord said, "What's the matter with you?
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   Why are you like this?
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.240]   You seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God."
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.480]   This did not Abraham, they were claiming that they were Abram seed, he said, "You do the
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.880]   deeds of your father."
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.400]   They said to him, "We be not born of fornication, we have one father, even God."
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.360]   Jesus said unto them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I proceeded forth and
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.320]   came from God, neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.240]   Why do ye not understand my speech, even because ye cannot hear my word?
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.840]   You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.600]   He was a murderer from the beginning, and a bird not in the truth, because there is
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.280]   no truth in him.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:29.840]   When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar, and the father of it."
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.200]   That's our Lord's own description of Satan the devil, and the Bible constantly speaks
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.360]   of him in the same way.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.960]   We read in the epistle to the Hebrews about the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.800]   The apostle Paul in his second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 11 and verse 3
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:55.320]   reminds them of how Satan at the beginning beguiled Eve, beguiled, he's a liar, and the
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:05.920]   father of lies, he's a deceiver, he's a lying spirit, with all deceivableness, says Paul
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.640]   again in the second epistle to the Thessalonians and so on.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.760]   Well now, here you see is the great characteristic of the devil and his works, that's his personality,
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:27.560]   as Peter here reminds Paul, Ananias, and Sapphira, they were the dukes of this master liar, the
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:36.160]   father of lies, the devil, and this is seen in all that he does, he's the one who changes
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:44.080]   his tactics, anything to suit his own cause, he'll contradict himself, he'll say that a
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.280]   thing which he said was true a hundred years ago is no longer true, he'll change even from
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.240]   day to day if necessary.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.440]   He can turn himself, says Paul, into an angel of light, he can quote the scriptures as he
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.680]   did to our Lord as if he believed them and meant them, he is a liar, there is nothing
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.520]   to which he won't stoop to gain his own nefarious ends.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.240]   That's his characteristic, he is a liar from the beginning, he is the father of lies.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.560]   Well now, what concerns us in particular tonight is this, what are the lies that he gets mankind
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   to believe?
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:29.240]   You see, I'm just reminding you that the fundamental postulate of the whole of the Bible is this,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:36.920]   that the world is as it is tonight because it listens to the lies of the devil instead
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   of listening to God, it's the whole cause of the trouble.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.160]   Now then, what are these lies?
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.720]   There's no difficulty about answering the question, unfortunately, we know it from experience
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.520]   the moment we detect these things and understand them, but it's laid before us so plainly in
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   the Bible.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   What are the lies?
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.680]   Well, the first of course is about himself.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.600]   In many ways the cleverest of all the devil's liars is to persuade people that there is
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:11.320]   no devil, that's the real masterpiece, keeps himself out of sight.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.560]   You know the art of fishing one understands is that the fisherman keeps himself out of
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.840]   sight, the fish doesn't see him, you hide yourself, camouflage yourself, that's the
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   way you do it.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.920]   Well the devil is a master at this, and of course at the present time, he is succeeding
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.800]   admirably, the world thinks it's quite ridiculous to believe in a personal devil.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:42.440]   What they say in 1966, believing in a personal devil, the thing is monstrous, it's quite
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.440]   ridiculous.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:50.000]   You see, he's so successful in putting on this lie.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.520]   Another thing he does of course is to persuade people that there's no such thing as evil.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:02.240]   Now, let me just dismiss this part by putting it humbly like this, and quickly.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.140]   You remember a man called Professor Jowd, who after years of atheism and so on, announced
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.020]   eventually that he was a Christian.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.480]   You remember how he first was moved out of his old position?
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.760]   It was this he tells us, that in the Spanish Civil War, he saw things which convinced him
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.600]   of the reality of evil as a power.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.960]   Now before that, as a philosopher, he had never believed that evil was positive.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.440]   He'd always thought that evil was the absence of certain qualities, but there he saw things
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.080]   that convinced him that evil was a reality and was a power, that was the first step.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.560]   Well very well, you go on, you see, and you discover there is a devil at the back of evil,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:52.420]   a personal power, surrounded by great forces and other mercenaries, if you may describe
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.760]   them, in his great army.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.120]   The Apostle Paul puts it all in that sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, "We
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.400]   wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.920]   rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high or in heavenly
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   places."
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.480]   As it says, "Headed up by the devil, these unseen spiritual evil malign forces."
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:24.060]   But the devil persuades people with his lie that there's no such thing, no devil, no evil
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.720]   spirits, no demons, nothing at all, none of the hobgoblins about which John Bunyan wrote
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.840]   in that great hymn, all nonsense, fairytales, typical of people in the past when they believed
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.360]   in this kind of thing, nothing there, that's the first great lie with which he deceives
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   the human race.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.760]   But oh, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.840]   The next lie of which he convinces us is about ourselves, and what he does here, and this
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:57.480]   is again, of course, a proof of his mastery, of his subtle cleverness.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.960]   He makes us think that we are complimenting ourselves when he persuades us to believe
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.640]   that we're only animals, that man is only an animal, that there is no such thing as
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.960]   the soul, that there is no such thing as a spirit.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.920]   He makes us believe that we're complimenting ourselves when we say that, that we're just
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.000]   animals, reasoning animals, perhaps a little more developed than the others, but only animals,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.040]   only a matter of degree, no difference in kind, and that there's no such thing as the
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   soul.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.920]   Sir Arthur Keith, having dissected so many bodies, said he'd never come across an organ
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.240]   called the soul.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.840]   Great laughter amongst the elite.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840]   The devil.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.440]   Man hasn't got a soul, man hasn't got a spirit, man's only an animal.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.880]   And then he goes on to deceive us into thinking that we are essentially good animals.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.680]   There's nothing really wrong with us, and this biblical doctrine of sin is a libel on
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   us.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   It's not true.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   Man's essentially good.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:04.000]   Of course, you mustn't look at the world and see what man does, you just believe this,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.560]   and you believe that man is essentially good, and man's ready to believe it.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.160]   He has no idea he's believing a lie, he won't be honest enough to face himself, so he believes
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.480]   the lie.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.440]   And then he believes that he's more sinned against than sinning.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.560]   Isn't man responsible for the state of the world?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   Well what is?
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.360]   Well I don't know, it isn't I, it's never I, I do no wrong.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.840]   Other people, and yet it can't be them, because they're human beings like I am, and if I'm
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.160]   essentially good, so are they.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.040]   Well where does the evil come from?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.480]   Well we don't know, there's just something wrong with the works somewhere.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.240]   But man is essentially good, and he's more sinned against than sinning.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.520]   And as we saw, was it last Sunday night, he believes, he persuades us also into believing
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.540]   that the world is improving, getting better and better.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:58.180]   Things kinder, more considerate, wouldn't dream of blasting thousands, millions of people
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.740]   suddenly to death for nothing.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:05.860]   No, no, man is essentially good, and he's improving, this upward trend, and the devil
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.020]   persuades people to believe that.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:14.260]   They believe it tonight, in 1966, though we've seen all we've seen in this century, and all
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:21.540]   we read in the newspapers, they believe that the whole thing's getting better and better.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:29.500]   And we will arrive at perfection, as the result of this marvelous evolutionary process.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.960]   He persuades mankind to believe that about themselves, and then, of course, his lie about
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.540]   God.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.420]   The first one he always tries is to say there is no God.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.020]   Nothing new about this, people think this is a new one, it isn't.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.140]   In the 14th psalm, you read in the first verse, "The fool hath said in his heart there is
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.460]   no God."
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.780]   The devil was doing it then, that's an old trick.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:00.140]   But he gets many people to believe that still.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.780]   But if he fails with that one, he tries another one, if a man believes in God, well then,
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:11.900]   the devil persuades him, oh yes, there is a God, but he's against you.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:20.100]   He's a fiend, he's a tyrant, he just enjoys keeping you down, he's an unjust God, he's
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.100]   an unfair God.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.780]   Yes, there is a God, but why does he allow children to be born mutilated, why does he
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.780]   allow war?
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.660]   There is a God, but he's a tyrant, he's against you.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.780]   You remember that was the lie which he spoke to Adam and Eve in the original temptation
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.740]   and they believed it, and mankind has been believing the lie and the suggestion ever
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:51.500]   since that God is against us and unfair to us and the masses believe it and are ready
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.820]   to blame God whenever things go wrong and they never think of him when anything goes
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.820]   right.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.340]   This is all a part of the lies of the devil.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:08.300]   And then you see, he goes on to persuade us that if we really want to be free and to enjoy
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:14.380]   true happiness, the one thing to do is to defy that God and to turn your back upon him
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.340]   and have nothing further to do with him.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.980]   Again the original temptation, hath God said?
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.100]   God is only concerned to keep you down and to keep this knowledge from you.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.580]   You defy him, you eat of that and then your eyes will be opened, you'll have understanding
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.940]   and you'll be as God's, you'll be liberated, you'll be free, you'll really function as
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.300]   human beings worthy of the name.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.740]   That's the thing, and you'll have true happiness.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:53.100]   And then you see he goes on to tell us that there's nothing beyond this world, that when
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.100]   a man dies it's the end of the story.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:02.660]   So it doesn't really matter very much what you do, gather your rosebuds while you may,
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:09.000]   drink and be merry, tomorrow you die, there's nothing after life, there's no judgment, there's
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.020]   no eternal future and eternal existence.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.180]   You've therefore got nothing to worry about, don't listen to preachers who preach about
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:23.020]   law and condemnation and judgment and call for responsibility, don't listen to that.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:29.260]   No, no, make the best of it, have a good time, enjoy yourself.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:36.180]   In other words you see the message as we are told so often in the Old Testament, the message
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.900]   which is delivered by those who are duped by the lie of the devil is always to say peace,
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.700]   peace to us when there is no peace.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.220]   You'll notice in the Old Testament there was a great conflict always in Israel between
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:54.140]   two lots of prophets, there was the true prophet and there were the people described as the
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.140]   false prophets.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.620]   Of course there were always more false prophets than true prophets, there's one great illustration
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:06.540]   of this, Elijah on Mount Carmel, he was standing absolutely alone, the only prophet of God.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:13.020]   Arrayed against him were some 450 prophets of Baal, if I remember rightly, and 400 other
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.020]   prophets.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.700]   At the end of it there was a total of 850 false prophets against the one true prophet.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:25.220]   That's typical of the whole of the Old Testament struggle, the same fight, the representative
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:32.140]   of God, one man, the minority, the remnant, the masses, the representatives of the devil.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.580]   And the message of the false prophets was always the same.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:42.980]   Jeremiah brings it home to them in these words, these prophets he said that say peace, peace
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.580]   when there is no peace, these prophets that would heal the hurt of the affliction of the
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:57.380]   daughter of my people, lightly, slightly saying peace, peace when there is no peace.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.380]   And they're still doing it.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:06.180]   This lying spirit that grips the minds and the hearts of men in prominent positions and
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:11.940]   though the world is going to hell they still say all is well, all is getting better, don't
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.580]   get alarmed, don't get excited, there's no judgment, there's no eternity, there's
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.580]   nothing.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:24.620]   All is well, peace, peace, carry on, keep on with the drink and the dancing, have your
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.340]   good time, be irresponsible, all is well, everything will somehow come out alright.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:36.500]   That's what they say, with the world as it is, that's the lie of the devil.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.340]   Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie?
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:49.700]   And of course, the final thing about which he is constantly lying is about the person
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.660]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.660]   You'd expect this, wouldn't you?
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.820]   Here God is sent into the conflict and into the fight, the second Adam.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:10.860]   Here is God's supreme act, and the devil concentrates, and here is manufactured lies.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:16.540]   There's a great deal about this in the Bible, I can only summarize it very, very briefly,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.020]   but you see it to perfection, if you like, in the temptations of our Lord himself in
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.020]   the wilderness.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:27.140]   You remember he was there forty days and forty nights, tempted of the devil, and this was
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.860]   the form the temptation took, you remember, the devil came in all his subtlety and cleverness
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:38.140]   and said, "If thou be the son of God, if."
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:45.100]   That's the query, that's the question, that's the thing on which he is always concentrated.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:50.060]   That's what our Lord was saying there to those Pharisees on that occasion of which I read
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.380]   the account you just know in the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:05.700]   But listen to Paul putting it, "No man having the spirit of God in him," says Paul in 1
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:15.180]   Corinthians 12, 3, "No man having the spirit of God in him saith that Jesus is accursed.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:22.380]   And no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:28.020]   But the man as he was not speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed."
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:34.500]   There it is, now listen to John putting it in his first epistle, chapter 4, "Beloved,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:41.180]   believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.180]   prophets are gone out into the world.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:50.300]   Ye have I know ye the spirit of God, every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.140]   come in the flesh is of God.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.520]   And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.520]   God.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.380]   And this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.140]   now already is it in the world."
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.100]   That was the great fight at the very beginning.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.420]   At the moment the church was born, as it were, the evil one came with his lies, and this
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:21.920]   was the supreme lie, that Jesus of Nazareth was only a man, nothing but a man.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.020]   This claim to be equal with God and Son of God, it was blasphemy, that's why they put
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.020]   him to death.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.580]   "Who is this fellow," they said, "this carpenter, this son of Joseph?"
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.980]   These claims, these are lies, they said, "this man's an imposter, this fellow."
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   And they hated him, and they gnashed their teeth at him, and finally they got him crucified
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.860]   and killed on that cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:52.180]   "Oh, this has always been the thing," I say, "about which they have fought most strenuously."
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.180]   And it went on.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.100]   Peter, in his second epistle, in the second chapter, puts it like this, "There were false
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.260]   prophets also among the people, the children of Israel, even as there shall be false teachers
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:11.020]   among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that brought
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.580]   them, and bring upon themselves a swift destruction."
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.740]   And when you read the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, in a sense, you know,
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.900]   that's nothing again but a dramatic representation of this great conflict, especially towards
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   the end.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.100]   In chapter 12, you get a perfect summary of it, that old dragon rising out of the sea
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:36.100]   called the devil, tries to destroy this child by pouring forth water out of his mouth upon
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.460]   him, trying to drown him and his mother.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.060]   The beast rising up out of the sea, these are pictorial representations of the power
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:51.100]   of the devil and of evil, trying to destroy the Son of God, trying to say that he's only
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   a man.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:58.060]   Oh, yes, they're prepared to praise him as a great man and a good man, but he was only
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.380]   a man born like everybody else.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.860]   Some of them are foolish enough, and these, you know, are very poor representatives of
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860]   the devil.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.380]   Now, the ones who say, as you know, it has been said recently, that he was the illegitimate
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:16.940]   child of Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, he's a very poor servant of the devil,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.940]   that poor man.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.380]   There's no subtlety about that, that gives the whole game away, that's making it obviously
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.380]   ridiculous.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.860]   He shouldn't have said that, I'm sure he's been reprimanded by his master for saying
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.860]   it.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.980]   No, no, the subtle thing is, you see, is to praise him as a man, and you don't say things
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:38.020]   like that, but as long as they think he's only a man, you shoot out the supernatural
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:43.960]   and the miraculous, and the divine, and his atoning death, all that must go, of course.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.380]   Just a man, anything to rob him of his glory and of his deity, that's the lie, and the
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.420]   devil has been persuading men to believe it throughout the running century.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:59.720]   Now then, there is the essential teaching of this lie, those are the chief lies which
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.380]   he persuades men and women today to believe, as he has been persuading them to believe
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.540]   them throughout the running centuries.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.020]   Let me hurry on.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.820]   What happens to a man who listens to this?
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.820]   What are the results of listening to his teaching?
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:20.100]   They're always the same, they're all here in this one story of Ananias and Sapphira.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:26.600]   It always ends in bondage, the devil promises liberty, never gives it.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.040]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.220]   If the devil were speaking the truth, there'd be no unhappiness in this world, there'd be
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.640]   no problems, there'd be no suffering, there'd be no misery, there'd be no threat of war.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:47.300]   No, no, the devil always produces bondage, because he always produces confusion.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.140]   The moment a man listens to the devil, he's under the power of the devil, what the Bible
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.060]   calls the dominion of sin and Satan.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.540]   The moment men believed that devils lie, what happened, he became the victim of the world
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.020]   and the flesh and the devil, and that's the whole trouble in the world tonight.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.500]   Men and women are not free, they're the victims of the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.300]   Why do they do what they do?
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.500]   Because everybody else does.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.380]   The way of the world, the social round, the thing to do, the thing the best people are
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.380]   doing.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.500]   They have no idea why they're doing them, they're just slaves.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.780]   Ready-made opinions in the popular newspapers, get them on the wireless television, there
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.340]   it is, you've got it all.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.220]   They never think they're slaves, it's awful slavery, it always leads to that.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.820]   But the thing that I want to bring out tonight is this, look at the selfishness to which
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   it always leads.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:41.940]   Ananias and Sapphira, "Why hath Satan filled your hearts to lie to the Holy Ghost?"
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.740]   Selfishness, you see, you pretend you're giving to others and helping others, but you're
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:52.140]   not, you're keeping back so much for yourselves, you're not only liars, but you're selfish
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.140]   liars.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.660]   You're always thinking of yourself, you put yourself first, everybody else comes anywhere
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.660]   else.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.020]   It's always the result of listening to the liars of the devil.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:09.020]   Isn't the whole trouble in the world tonight, in a sense, due to selfishness?
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.620]   Selfishness, everybody out for himself, "I'm all right, Jack."
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.500]   What's it matter what the other fellow gets or what happens to him as long as I'm all
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.500]   right?
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.100]   Of course, we put up a show of being philanthropic and so on, but it's a facade, it's not
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.300]   true.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:29.940]   Selfishness, man's not content with his own wife, he must have the wife of the other fellow.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.900]   He covets her, and so on, in business, in the professions, they're torn, they're filled
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.980]   with this jealousy and envy and spite and malice, they're seething with it, the whole
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.940]   lot of them, and all your upper reaches of your social classes and everywhere, selfishness.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:53.020]   Here it is in Ananias and Zephira, believing the devil's lie always leads to it and it's
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.780]   the cause of the tragedy of the human race, but look at the short-sightedness that it
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.540]   always produces.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.580]   It gives you a temporary satisfaction, temporary success.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.780]   You're happy when you're drunk, you're miserable the next morning, you're happy when you're
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:13.340]   spitting upon the sanctities and desecrating God's holy law, but you suffer for it afterwards
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.340]   in remorse and you feel you're a cad and worse.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.460]   Temporary satisfaction, temporary happiness.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:26.540]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews says that Moses preferred to suffer affliction
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:35.200]   with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.020]   They never last more than a season, and the season gets shorter and shorter as you go
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.740]   on with it all, never a permanent satisfaction, it's only temporary, it's a deceit, he's
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.700]   a cheat, he's a liar, the prospectus isn't true.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:34:01.340]   It never lasts in any sense, and eventually it always leads to judgment.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.520]   You think you've been clever, you've covered it all, you're confronted suddenly by a Peter
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:11.100]   who says, "Ananias, why hast thou filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.340]   back part of the price of the lend?
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.940]   Was it remained, was it not thine own, and after it was sold, was it not in thine own
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.940]   power?
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.940]   Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart?
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.940]   Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.100]   Peter said to Sapphira, "How is it that you have agreed together?
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:36.000]   Tell me whether he sold the lend for so much?" and she said, "Yea, for so much, bare-faced
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.920]   liar."
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.120]   But judgment comes, you see, it catches up with you.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:51.280]   You can't get away from it, you can't escape, and eventually you're cornered, and you're
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   faced with the punishment that you deserve, and the doom, eternal doom, to which it leads.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:07.600]   That, my dear friends, is the truth about this liar, this devil, this Satan, this hater
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:13.080]   of God, this hater of men, ultimately, this enemy of men, this adversary of men.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.480]   That's his character, that's what he teaches, those are the results to which believing his
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.800]   teaching leads.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:28.000]   Oh, what a joy, what a blessed relief to turn to the other side, and that's why we're here
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   tonight.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.580]   This is what Christianity is, to say that that's not the whole truth, that is the truth,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.880]   and until you believe that, you won't listen to the second side, you won't see any need
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   of it.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.360]   But if you've seen that, well then, I say, listen for your lives, I've got something
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.040]   wonderful to tell you.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:49.080]   Satan fills the heart, but there is another who is ready to fill the heart.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:54.740]   They were all filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:58.400]   This is the thing that we begin to read of in the second chapter of this book of the
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   Acts of the Apostles.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.920]   This was the thing that was promised, the promise of the Father.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.000]   This was the thing our Lord himself promised, he said, "It is expedient for you that I go
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.680]   away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.480]   But if I go away, I will send him unto you," and he sent him on the day of Pentecost, and
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.440]   the church came into being, the marvelous things we've read of and considered together
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.800]   began to take place.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.240]   The Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, who is he?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.800]   Oh, what a contrast, what a difference in character.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.640]   He's called the Spirit of Holiness.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.720]   He is called the Spirit of Truth.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.560]   Our Lord said, "He will lead you into all truth."
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:44.880]   He's the eternal antithesis to the devil in every respect, but supremely in this, that
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:50.560]   he is the great Spirit of Truth, and this is what's so wonderful, because he is the
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.680]   Spirit of Truth, he's always the same.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.760]   The devil, like a chameleon, is always changing, black at one time, white the next, denouncing
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:05.880]   Scripture, quoting Scripture, anything to attain his own ends and to get us into his
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.320]   grip, always changing, says the truth changes, despises what people thought a hundred years
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   ago.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.560]   This alone is truth that we've now got, always changing from, almost from day to day.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:24.320]   You never know what is the truth because it's always moving, but here is the Spirit of Truth,
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.040]   and he's always the same in all ages.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.400]   The truth I'm privileged to preach to you tonight is truth unchanged, unchanging.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.720]   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   What's my message tonight?
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.440]   My dear friends, it's, there's nothing new about my message, I am trying to preach to
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:51.760]   you, and oh may the Spirit of God take me, and out of sight that you may hear this message,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.320]   I'm simply repeating the message preached by the apostles.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.800]   I'm not preaching something that's suddenly been discovered in the 1960s, I'm not preaching
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.520]   tonight what I've just read in the latest book that's come out by some great philosopher,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:11.200]   thank God I'm not, I'm preaching eternal truth, the everlasting gospel, the message
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.280]   that has been preached throughout the running centuries by saints, apostles and prophets
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.160]   and martyrs.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.160]   What is it?
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   What is the truth that he teaches?
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:28.120]   Well, I can only give it to you in summary form, but here it is.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:35.160]   He tells us the truth about us, about ourselves, and what he tells us is this, that man is
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.960]   not an animal.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.880]   Let us make man in our own image, and in the image and likeness of God he made him, man
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.080]   as a soul, as a spirit, he's meant for God.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:54.640]   He knows it within himself, he's dissatisfied, he cries out for some emperor, ether, divine
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.320]   or air, there's nothing in the world that can really ultimately satisfy him, though
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:06.560]   he tries to persuade himself he's getting it, there's a thirst, a hunger, a restlessness.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:14.000]   Augustine went through it, "Thou hast made us for thyself and ourselves a restless, until
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.560]   they find their rest in thee."
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.040]   He's tried the ram, kept his mistress, "Ah, but he's too big for it, the soul."
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:30.640]   "Thus thou art, O thus returnest," was not spoken of the soul, this intangible thing
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.080]   in man, this thing that sets him apart from the animals, this is what the Bible tells
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.960]   us, the spirit of truth, the Holy Spirit, this is what he tells us.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.400]   And that we are responsible to God, that we are not just irresponsible animals, to obey
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.640]   our lusts and passions and desires and eat too much and drink too much and indulge sex
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:57.680]   too much, no, no, man is a responsible being meant to exercise discipline and control,
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:06.080]   a master, the lord of creation, God's representative in this universe.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.760]   But you see he doesn't stop at that, unfortunately, and we know that this is the truth.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.280]   He tells us that though man was created like that and meant to be like that always, that
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.640]   in his folly he listened to the devil and he fell and brought down chaos upon himself
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:26.680]   and the whole of his world and posterity, that man by now is a fallen creature and that
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.080]   all his suffering is the result of that.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.680]   Well then he goes on to tell us about the truth about God and what is it all the glory
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:53.200]   of God. "Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible, hid from our eyes,
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:41:00.400]   most blessed, most glorious, the ancient of days, pavilioned in splendor, uncurded with
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:12.680]   prayers, God is light and in him is no darkness at all, God the creator, God the all-powerful,
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   God the just, the righteous, the holy, who is of such pure countenance that he cannot
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:24.500]   even look upon sin, God who is the judge of the ends of the earth, the moral governor
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:30.240]   of the universe, the one who has made us and under whom we all live and exist and before
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.400]   whom we shall all have to appear and render an account."
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:41.560]   That's the teaching of the Holy Spirit as you find it in this book, about God, but it
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   isn't the whole.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.320]   Thank God we wouldn't be here if it were.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   I wouldn't dare come anywhere near him.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   I would fly.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   I'd be terrified.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:56.640]   Who am I to speak of such a person, leave alone to try to approach into his presence?
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:03.140]   But it goes on, the Spirit goes on to tell me that God is a God of love and of infinite
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.960]   kindness and mercy and compassion.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:13.760]   Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it again to the Ephesians, "But God who is rich in
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:22.260]   mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses and
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:28.900]   sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, well that in the ages to come he might show
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:38.520]   the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Jesus Christ."
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:45.400]   The Old Testament psalmists and prophets have glimpsed it by revelation and they've experienced
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   it.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.760]   The psalmist has sinned against God and he doesn't know what to do with himself, but
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:55.560]   he must go back to God for there's nobody else, and he cries out, he stumbles, he stutters,
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:02.360]   "With thee there is mercy that thou mayest be feared."
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:10.880]   The kindness of the Lord, "As far as the east is from the west, so far hast thou removed
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.360]   our transgressions from us."
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:20.180]   This is the teaching of the Holy Spirit concerning God, far from being against us.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.160]   He loves us in spite of our being what we are.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.660]   When men rebelled against him in the perfection of paradise, God didn't blast him to eternity
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:37.240]   and everlasting misery, God informed him of a plan of redemption and of restoration that
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.440]   he'd already formed concerning him.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:46.600]   God, the God who's insulted and rebelled and against whom men in his folly rebelled, this
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.640]   very God conceives a way of redeeming man, saving him, delivering him from himself and
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.320]   the consequences of his listening to the lie of the devil.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.420]   And in the Old Testament you find the announcements of this.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:06.200]   God takes a man called Abram, turns him into a nation, uses him as the medium and the vehicle
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.840]   of his revelation, and look at the way he handled those children of Israel, what a miserable
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.780]   lot they were, no worse than us, you know.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:18.760]   But there they are, sinning against God, then going back to him, cringing, then he forgives
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.920]   them and blesses them, and they promise him, back they go and sin against him.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:28.200]   You'll think this time, "No, he can't forgive them," but he does, "Oh, the long suffering
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:34.600]   and the patience of God with this recalcitrant people, but that's the God whom the Holy Spirit
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   reveals."
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:47.720]   Oh, but above and beyond everything else, the Holy Spirit has been sent into the church
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.240]   to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   He said so.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.300]   He said, "He shall glorify me," and that is what he does.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.680]   This is the supreme work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:06.600]   He tells us the truth about this person, Jesus of Nazareth, who is he, that's the question.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.120]   What think ye of Christ?
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.160]   And the Holy Spirit answers the question in all the amazing record of this, what we call
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   the New Testament.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:28.020]   Here it is, in one verse, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.760]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:41.700]   Son of God, babe of Bethlehem, eternal Son of God, God is the flesh, the Word made flesh,
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:46.500]   held in flesh, the Godhead sees as Charles Wesley, and that's it.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.460]   The Holy Ghost alone can reveal that.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.820]   I was reminding the morning congregation of what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, verse 8.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.220]   He says that when Christ came, the princes of this world did not know him, for had they
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.020]   known him they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.060]   The great men of the world rejected him.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:08.780]   They saw only Jesus, a man, a carpenter, but the Spirit reveals him as Son of God, God
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.700]   in the flesh, the miracle of the Incarnation, the virgin birth, the miraculous power, all
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.220]   he did, all he said, all he taught, the very way in which he came, the Holy Spirit reveals
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.220]   all this.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:31.780]   He has an amazing life of perfection, his kindness, his compassion, the friend of publicans
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   and sinners.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.580]   The Pharisees and scribes didn't like him, they were not sure that he was a very nice
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.580]   person.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.780]   He even sits and eats and drinks with publicans and sinners.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.780]   He allows a howler to wash his feet with her tears and to wipe them with the hair of her
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   head.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.780]   Ah, this is impossible.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.780]   Tell us an impossible.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.340]   Oh, but that's what he did.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:56.660]   He was filled with kindness and compassion, and he said, "He who hath seen me hath seen
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.660]   the Father."
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.740]   He said, "God is like this, don't listen to what the others have told you about him.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:08.540]   He's not remote and against you, he's for you, and I am come the Son of God, and I am
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.820]   come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.140]   I am come that he might have life and that he might have it more abundantly.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.060]   I am come to deliver."
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:24.340]   Oh, he refers then to his approaching death and he says, "The Son of Man is not come to
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:32.140]   be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.060]   He's come to die."
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.340]   And this is the whole of the teaching of the Holy Spirit about him in the whole of the
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.740]   New Testament, that he went to the cross deliberately.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.740]   Why?
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.980]   Well, because he saw this was the only way whereby anybody could be delivered, anybody
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.020]   could be forgiven and redeemed.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.580]   He's bearing the punishment of my sins.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.580]   He's taking my guilt upon him.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.700]   That's why he came.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:58.460]   He came to taste death for every man.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:04.700]   That's what the Holy Spirit teaches us about him, that he died that we might be forgiven.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.060]   He died to make us good.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.980]   They buried him in a grave, but he rose again.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.380]   The resurrection in the body is a fact and it is the proof that his work was complete
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:17.380]   and finished.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.980]   He ascended in the sight of these very apostles who are witnesses and he seated at the right
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:27.460]   hand of God in the glory everlasting and he sent down the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:33.260]   to make these things known, to give power to feeble preachers to authenticate the truth
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.340]   concerning himself.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:42.620]   And you see the message can be summarized as it is summarized by the Apostle Paul in
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:48.260]   the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans in these words, listen, "When we were yet
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:54.980]   without strength in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:49:00.700]   Far scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet for adventure for a good man some
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:07.860]   would even dare to die, but God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.420]   sinners Christ died for us."
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:17.460]   In verse 10 he says, "For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:24.860]   of his Son, how much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life?"
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:29.340]   My friend this is the message, this is what the Holy Spirit tells you about God, that
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:34.020]   God is not only not against you, he is for you to this extent and loves you to this extent,
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:41.220]   that he spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all, he laid you as sins upon
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:48.740]   him, by his thrift you are healed, he offers you free pardon and forgiveness and all you
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:54.780]   stand in need of, that's the message of the Holy Ghost.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.280]   What happens to us when we believe this?
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.380]   You get to know at once that your sins are forgiven, that you are reconciled to God.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:11.180]   You lose the fear of the judgment, you have peace with God.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:20.340]   Not only that, you are conscious within you of a new nature, a new life, a new start.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:25.300]   You get deliverance, this isn't a philosophy, this isn't a teaching, the message of this
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.500]   gospel is not to exhort you to put yourself right or to pull yourself up or to try and
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:33.260]   live a good life and thereby put yourself right with God and solve your problems, it
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.100]   knows you can't do that, no, no, it's a message of a supernatural God-like deliverance.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:44.460]   Paul puts it like this again in Romans 1.16, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ",
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.460]   why not?
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:50.540]   Well, he says it is the power of God unto salvation, not the power of a man, not the
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:58.940]   power of a sociologist, not the power of a government or elections, the power of God
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:04.420]   delivers us from the devil, translates us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:14.660]   of God's dear Son, sets us free, produces a new type of character, the character depicted
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.940]   here by Barnabas and others, these men who honestly and genuinely sold their goods and
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:27.580]   gave it a concern for other people, no longer this selfish self-centered little life, but
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:33.380]   a concern for others, oh, I could keep you here for hours just reminding you of facts
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.740]   that the devil has very conveniently got people to forget.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.620]   The most beneficent institution that this world has ever known has been the Christian
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:47.300]   Church, before your politicians ever came into being with their reforms, the Church
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:56.460]   had poor relief for the poor, introduced education for the poor, started hospitals, the Church,
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.660]   Christian people, not a mere institution, but genuine Christian people, have been the
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:08.380]   pioneers in all this work throughout the ages and the centuries, these are sure facts.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:12.980]   They've done it in this country, they've done it in other countries, they've sacrificed
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.780]   themselves for others.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:20.720]   Here they are, you see, and they're living a new kind of life, they're all of one accord
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.380]   and they're showing the fruits of the Spirit.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:28.060]   If you want to know the difference between the two lives, the life of listening to the
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:32.700]   devil and the life of those who listen to the Holy Spirit, well, I can read it to you
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:38.340]   in a few words given by the Apostle Paul in the fifth chapter of his epistle to the Galatians.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   Here it is.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:46.780]   "The works of the flesh, this is the life lived by those whose hearts are filled by
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:47.780]   Satan.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:56.180]   The works of the flesh which are manifest are these, adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:04.420]   lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:11.620]   vices, envyings, murderers, drunkenness, revellings, and such like."
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:16.540]   It was true then, that's what's most true of the life of London tonight.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.740]   That's the result of listening to the lies of the devil.
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.460]   Do you want to know the result of listening to the teaching of the Holy Spirit?
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:32.260]   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:37.420]   temperance, oh, what a contrast.
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:40.460]   You see, this is the marvellous thing about it.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:45.360]   You believe this message, get your heart filled with the Holy Spirit, and you're not left
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.100]   to yourself to struggle against impossible odds.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.980]   The Spirit of God comes into you, they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:58.420]   A strength divine comes in and lifts a man up and out of himself, and enables him to
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:02.540]   do things that were formerly impossible.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.540]   What does that lead to?
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.540]   Well, it gives satisfaction.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:13.340]   And let me put it like this, in the modern world that is so materialistic and mercenary
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:18.700]   in its outlook, and so interested in money, and wearing football boots, money, the key
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:24.740]   to success and happiness and all things, here is a life that gives you satisfaction without
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.740]   money.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:31.500]   These people are ready to sell all their possessions and give it into a common fund, a common pool.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:36.660]   You can be happy without money, you're not dependent upon money.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.980]   One of the first things that happens to a man whose heart is filled with the Spirit
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:44.400]   is he becomes independent of the world and its circumstances and surroundings.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.740]   John Bunyan was expressing that in that great hymn, "Let them all rise against us," he says,
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:53.540]   as Luther had said before him, "Let Satan rise with all his malignity, they can't touch
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.540]   us."
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.860]   We're totally safe, we're independent.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:04.940]   Gives us lasting joy, solid treasure, joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.540]   He gives us peace.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.460]   He takes from us the fear of death and the grave.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.180]   Look at the boldness of these apostles, defying the authorities.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.060]   They're not afraid of death.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.100]   They were no longer.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:21.180]   And the early martyrs and confessors, they went gladly thrown to the lions in the arena,
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:26.620]   praising God and thanking Him that at last He's accounted them worthy to suffer finally
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:32.380]   in this way for the name of their blessed and their dear Lord.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:37.360]   They die well, as John Wesley used to put it.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.140]   The fear and the terror of death and the grave of God.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.140]   Why?
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:46.380]   Well, because they've got a hope of glory.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:52.100]   They can see that this is only a passing transient world.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:56.540]   This is not the world of reality, this is the world of appearances.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:01.160]   This is passing away, but there is a world that remains.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.820]   There is a land of pure delights where saints immortal reign.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.780]   There is a glory which is yet to be revealed.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:13.460]   There is a day coming when the glory of the sons of God shall be made manifest.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:18.140]   There is a crowning day coming, there is a day of ultimate victory and of triumph when
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.900]   Jesus shall reign from pole to pole.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:28.140]   And it is in the light of that that these men live the life they do and have this joy
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.700]   which persists even in the midst of tribulations.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:36.120]   My friends, I've put the two sides before you.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.780]   I've shown you the character of Satan, I've told you his message, I've told you the results
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:45.500]   to which believing it leads, I've told you something about the Holy Spirit and his character,
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:52.260]   I've revealed his message to you, I've told you the results to which that leads.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:57:00.140]   And now I ask you, with what is your heart filled?
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:05.940]   Is it filled with the lies of Satan or is it filled with the Holy Ghost?
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.180]   This is the thing that matters.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.420]   I'm standing here, you see me sweating before you.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.340]   Why do I do this?
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:18.740]   I do it, my friend, because having seen these things I'm concerned about you and your eternal
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.020]   destiny.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.500]   I see the lie, I've believed it myself.
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:30.060]   Thank God the Spirit has opened my eyes and I've seen this other.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:35.420]   And I put the two before you and I say to you, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ revealed
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:42.140]   by the Spirit, yield to the Spirit of God.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.780]   Shall I give you one final consideration?
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:45.780]   I must.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:53.500]   I have told you that the story of the human race is the story of this great conflict between
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:59.620]   the devil, if you like, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:05.540]   And it's been going on for centuries, it is still going on.
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:10.600]   But I would be very lacking in my duty to you and I would be failing in my concern for
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.700]   you and your eternal destiny if I didn't remind you of this.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:20.500]   There is the conflict, but it's going to end.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.740]   And we already know what the end is going to be.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:30.860]   The Lord Jesus Christ, just before he went to the cross, said this, "Now is the judgment
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:41.180]   of this world, now is the prince of this world cast out."
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:45.540]   And the Apostle Paul gives us a little light on that in his second chapter of his epistle
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:49.820]   to the Colossians, when he puts it like this in verse 15 and 16.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:58.500]   "And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.220]   over them in it."
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:06.900]   In other words, on the cross on Calvary's Hill, the devil received a mortal wound.
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:10.620]   He thought he'd succeeded, he'd captured the Son of God, he'd persuaded men to put
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.820]   him to death, very confident that that would be the end of him and that nothing more would
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.820]   ever be heard of him.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:20.700]   And oh, that was his supreme blunder, the blunder of the arch-criminal.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:23.420]   The criminal always makes one glaring blunder, there it is.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.420]   He thought that's the end.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.420]   It wasn't.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:31.280]   Christ rose from the dead, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them by it.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.500]   The very death which they thought was his defeat is his mightiest conquest.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:41.780]   He triumphs even over death and the grave, he ascends unto him, and he will, as I reminded
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:49.020]   you with the teaching of the book of Revelation, he will return again.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.860]   And we are told that he will come with great power.
[00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:00.060]   He will come riding upon his white horse, on his vesture and on his thigh a name is
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.820]   written "King of Kings" and "Lord of Lords."
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.620]   And this is what I read, "And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.940]   gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:20.220]   And the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrote miracles before him with
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.520]   which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   his image.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.620]   These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.940]   Don't worry about the imagery, it's the fact that matters.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.980]   "And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:45.260]   proceeded out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with the flesh.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:50.460]   And I saw the dead small and great stand before God, and the books were opened.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.640]   And another book was opened, which is the book of life.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.180]   And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.800]   to their words.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.820]   And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.960]   which were in them, and they were judged every man according unto their works.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.060]   And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.140]   This is the second death.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:19.440]   And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.580]   The end is certain.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:27.020]   The enemy is already doomed, he's living on a lease as it were.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:32.540]   He received that mortal wound when Christ died on the cross and his time is limited.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:38.620]   And that's why he's raging, but Christ will come, and with the breath of his mouth he
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:46.420]   will destroy that arch-liar and the enemy of God and of man, and send him to everlasting
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.900]   destruction.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:02:00.940]   Don't forget this, when the devil plies you with his lies, look to the end, my friend.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:08.060]   The pleasure he offers you is only transient and passing, but oh, that final end in which
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.660]   he himself will be involved.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:19.580]   God in Christ will triumph over all, the victory is his, and it is assured, and nothing can
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.580]   prevent it.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:29.700]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:35.060]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.340]   Believe in Christ tonight and you'll get to know him.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.900]   Not only that, he'll become your father, you'll become his child, he'll put his own nature
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.580]   in you, you'll have a new nature, you'll have a new start, you'll have a new beginning,
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:50.660]   he'll put his Holy Spirit in you, you'll have a strength you've never known before, you'll
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:56.100]   really begin to live, you'll begin to know peace and joy and happiness.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:02.820]   "And though men in their madness let off all their atomic bombs together, and the world
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:08.180]   be blown to atoms and to nothing, ye will have nothing to fear; ye will already, as
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:16.220]   the Son of God has said, ye will already have passed from death unto judgment," through
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:24.100]   judgment, "unto life, which is life indeed, which is life eternal.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.940]   God commandeth all men everywhere to repent and to believe in his Son, and whosoever doeth
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:37.420]   so shall not perish, but shall have here and now everlasting life."
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:44.060]   It'll take you through death, it'll take you through the judgment, it will take you into
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:52.860]   the very presence of God, and you shall see him and spend your eternity in the glory of
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:57.180]   his presence.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.980]   Have you repented?
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:07.140]   You are going to rise, my dear friend, you will rise from the grave, or if you're still
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.060]   alive when Christ comes back, you'll see him, you'll have to face him.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:17.380]   "It is appointed unto all men everywhere to once to die, and after death the judgment."
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:23.140]   God is going to judge the whole world in righteousness by this man whom he hath appointed, whereof
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:30.380]   he hath given assurance in that he hath raised him from the grave.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.660]   It's almost impossible to believe it now, isn't it?
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.860]   But you can't believe you're going to die, can you?
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.200]   You can't think of yourself as dying, and yet you know perfectly well that you're going
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   to.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.420]   Read the obituary notice in the Times, or whatever paper you read, "Ah," you say, "oh, so-and-so's
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420]   gone."
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.940]   The day will come when somebody will say that about you.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.020]   It's difficult to believe it, isn't it?
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:57.620]   And it's difficult to believe that you're going to rise from the dead, but if you believe
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:02.660]   that this Jesus is the Son of God and he's given proof in the resurrection that he is,
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:09.780]   believe him, and you must believe that you are going to rise and be examined by God in
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.980]   justice and righteousness.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:19.900]   And if you believe that, well, you won't waste a moment, you'll repent immediately, and you'll
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:26.100]   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and make sure that your sins are forgiven, that you
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:31.220]   become a child of God, and that you'll have nothing to fear in the judgment, because you
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:38.500]   are one of God's children, one of his heirs, and joint heir with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.460]   Amen.
