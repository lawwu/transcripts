[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260]   So let's talk about Citi thank you points because they're really interesting.
[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.340]   So first off, there's some bad ways to redeem them.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.200]   If you redeem them as statement credits, you can get one cent.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.360]   So it's not the worst, but I think transferable points are more valuable.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.280]   But if you wanted to play this whole game with cash back, just assume every point is worth one penny.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.760]   You can get one penny as a statement credit, or you can get one penny in the travel portal,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540]   or you can get one penny buying gift cards and some merchandise.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.000]   But at the end of the day, I would always encourage you for the same rate of return.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.520]   Get the cash, get the statement credit, pay off your balance, and then use the money saved
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.680]   and go buy travel with the airlines directly.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.260]   Earn points on that travel by using the Citi premier card.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.640]   Go buy gift cards somewhere else.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.860]   Go buy merchandise somewhere else.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.840]   So I would not use my Citi thank you points for anything other than statement credits
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.700]   or what I think is the best use, which is transferring them to airlines and hotels.
