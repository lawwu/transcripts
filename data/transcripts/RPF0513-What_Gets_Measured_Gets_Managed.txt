[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.400]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we continue with very practical advice on how to adjust
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.200]   your record keeping to actually help you figure out how to save money on the categories that
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.800]   matter most to you this year.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:01:06.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.520]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.480]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.800]   I think, I think, I think, I think, I think this will be the last one in this series wherein
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.600]   I try to get your new year started off right by giving you the tools that you can use and
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:35.480]   implement into your budget to save you some serious money.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.080]   As always, there are multiple areas in which we need to focus on finances.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.520]   We need to focus on increasing income and there's a lot of things that we can do there
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.600]   and working and finishing up this course that I'm doing on how to increase your income for
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.640]   those who purchased the beta version.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.920]   We can decrease your expenses and usually decreasing expenses for most people is the
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.680]   fastest way to make progress.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.000]   You can invest wisely.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.800]   It's very, very important but usually takes a huge amount of time.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.940]   You can avoid catastrophe and you can optimize your lifestyle.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.080]   All of those are the basic components and building blocks of how we approach finance
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.960]   and that's what we do each and every day.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.840]   However, today, for the last couple of weeks as we started the new year, I've been working
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.880]   on helping you to save money in your budget and I've been using the example from my own
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.720]   budget of me cutting back on grocery expenses and food expenses as a way of helping you
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   with some practical tips around food and grocery expenses but also as a way of teaching you
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.880]   some skills that you can apply to other areas of your budget.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.720]   My hope is that even if your grocery budget is well on track that you've been able to
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.040]   use some of these ideas and apply them to other areas.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.560]   So I have at least this one more in this series and then we'll maybe move on to other topics
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.760]   but I wanted to really focus in on helping you save money as we begin the new year.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.200]   If your life is anything like mine, you have some good habits, you have some good practices
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.680]   that you put in place but when at the end of the year, you look back on a whole calendar
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.640]   year, I get a little frustrated at how much money I spent and so it's nice to use that
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.720]   energy and that frustration for me frankly.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.600]   It's nice to use that frustration and the energy from it to make some changes that will
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   save me some money so that in January of next year, I'll be sitting here looking back and
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   a little bit happier.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   I can compare year to year and see the progress that we're making.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.920]   For me, probably groceries and again, I'm using this as an example.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.720]   There are other areas as well but groceries is one of those things where as my family
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.560]   grows, so does our grocery bill.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.160]   And so what was well squared away with a few years ago now needs additional work.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.600]   Today, I want to talk about the importance of budget categories.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   Now, if you haven't heard it, I would recommend you go back and listen to episode 408 from
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   January of last year wherein I discussed budget categories for the new year that actually
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   matter.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.880]   Again, episode 408, budget categories for the new year that actually matter and the
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.800]   point of that show and the point of that content is to look at your budget categories in a
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.040]   practical way in your financial tracking system, whatever that is, whether it's a piece of
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.120]   paper and you write things down, whether it's Mint.com, whether it's YNAB, radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.560]   for a free trial, whether it's personal capital, use the personal capital link on the website.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.120]   I think it's radicalpersonalfinance.com/personalcapital.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.000]   Whatever system is that you use, you need to have categories that are useful for you.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.080]   Maybe you use something that's on your bank.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.920]   And most people start with generic categories, the idea of, "Well, this is food or this
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.680]   is fuel or this is rent," and those things are useful.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.080]   But the whole point of tracking your money is so that you can make progress with your
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   money.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.600]   We don't just budget because it's fun.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.080]   We don't just track our money because it's fun.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.520]   We track it because it's useful and for some of us, it's fun.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.960]   Better to have a hobby of tracking your money and figuring out ways to save money sometimes
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.080]   than some other things that you can do.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   But we do it because it's useful so we can actually use the data.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.800]   Well, in order for you to use the data, you've got to articulate it and put it into a way
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.520]   that makes sense for you.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.720]   So in episode 408, I talked about how you should have some budget categories that are
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.160]   the ones that you want to minimize, pure costs, things that don't bring you joy and benefit
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   to your life.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.920]   There are some categories that you want to moderate, things that are important to you,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.840]   things that are expenditures that perhaps you don't strictly have to make.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.260]   You wouldn't make them in an emergency situation but they're things that add measurably to
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260]   your quality of life.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.360]   They're things that add measurably to your achievement of your goals.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.120]   They're things that add measurably to the joie de vivre that you actually experience.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.360]   Those may be the kind of things that you want to make sure are included in your budget but
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.660]   you don't want to let them get out of hand.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.760]   You may enjoy fine food and so for you, it's very important to on occasion buy really fancy
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   food and make a really special meal to enjoy with your friends or to buy a really nice
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.960]   wine or to go out into a nice dinner on occasion.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.240]   Well, those are the kinds of things that can add measurably if that's your deal, that can
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.940]   add measurably to your quality of life.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.520]   But if you do it every day, then it could get out of hand and it could actually diminish
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.680]   the enjoyment of the experience, things that are special.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.320]   If you have them too much, become less special.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.000]   There was a friend of mine who used to live in Cape Town, South Africa where lobster was
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.080]   cheap said, "To me," he said, "if you eat lobster all the time, it starts to taste like
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.440]   soap."
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.640]   Just about anything, if you do it in excess, it loses that sense of excitement.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.360]   Then there are certain budget categories that you may choose to maximize and you may say,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   these things are important.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.640]   A simple example would be savings.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.200]   It's very important that anything that you do that's savings is differentiated from other
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.440]   areas of your budget because you want to maximize your savings and there are certain things
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.600]   that perhaps are expenses in some cases but are savings in another.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.160]   Simple two examples from that show and I'm not going to rehash the whole show.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   I want to get to the point of today's show.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.040]   But two simple examples would be I always separate out my purchase of assets from my
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   purchase of just simple expenses.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.960]   So when I buy something, I buy a pickup truck as I did recently, then I sit and I categorize
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   that as an asset purchase.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.920]   The reason is that when I buy an asset, I'm paying cash for it.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.680]   So I'm writing a huge check for – or handing over stacks of $100 bills to somebody is the
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.280]   way that I buy vehicles.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.720]   Then I hand over stacks of $100 bills.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.580]   That's a giant outflow from my life.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.960]   But I'm doing my very best when I buy a thing to buy something that's going to have
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.720]   a very low amount of depreciation.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.760]   So I need a mental separation in my own life of what to do.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.360]   So as an example, I recently – let's just use this pickup truck that I recently bought
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.320]   and I will share more about this in a forthcoming episode about our plans for 2018.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.520]   But I bought a diesel pickup truck.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.040]   Now a diesel pickup truck of the kind that I bought is not inexpensive.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.580]   It's pretty expensive.
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.720]   Diesel pickup trucks are very expensive right now.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.360]   I very carefully thought through my purchase and my categorization and whatnot about how
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   I was going to do it.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.440]   But I paid probably at least $4,000 to $5,000 more to have a diesel pickup truck than what
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.480]   I could have paid to have something that was a gas pickup truck.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.200]   But on the flip side, I also am fully aware that for my application, towing a trailer
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.160]   significantly, which are our plans for 2018, I decided after making a mistake with the
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.440]   gas engine vehicle, I decided to go ahead and move to a diesel pickup truck to have
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.200]   a more pleasurable towing experience.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.640]   And secondarily, I know that that diesel pickup truck holds its value.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.560]   There's good resale value.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.920]   And so I'm consciously making a choice to spend more capital and putting it into an
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.960]   asset that will probably – if things work out, it will probably depreciate less than
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.300]   certain other choices I could make.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.720]   So that big cash outflow from my budget is not necessarily a pure expense.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.160]   And you may do this with other areas in your budget.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.720]   This is why it's so important to separate things out.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:24.320]   You might say, "I'm not going to go down to Ikea and buy the cheap bookcase that will
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.420]   last me for three years.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.980]   What I'm actually going to do is I'm going to go to an antique store and buy something
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.980]   more expensive," but that by choosing carefully the quality of the antique and the name brand,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.260]   it's something that will not lose value.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.900]   But you're going to spend triple or quadruple the cash out of your pocket, but you're
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.980]   doing it in a way that's an asset expenditure.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.840]   That's the type of thing that needs to be clearly differentiated.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.060]   Is this an asset expenditure or is this a consumption item?
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:59.960]   The Ikea bookshelf that you buy will be very cheap to buy, but it will quickly depreciate
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.540]   to a value of zero.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.580]   There's not a big market for it in the resale world, in the secondary market.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.020]   The antique bookcase that you buy or the antique four-poster bed that you choose to furnish
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.440]   your house with may be very expensive to buy relative to the Ikea version, but perhaps
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.820]   its actual terminal value stays consistent and/or goes up.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.940]   So I like to separate those things into the category of what I just use as asset expenditures.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.940]   Then of course I track all of the expenses that are associated with that asset.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.420]   That separation in your tracking system is very valuable to put your head in a different
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.420]   space.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.500]   Now of course if you're going to buy an asset, you want to get the best deal possible.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.820]   But you don't want to mess yourself up and say, "Well, I'm scrimping and saving
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.080]   over here on tortilla chips by trying to find the cheapest tortilla chips and that makes
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.500]   an impact of $3 on my annual spending budget.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.060]   Meanwhile over here I'm going to buy this expensive thing, so I'm just going to blow
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.060]   my budget.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.060]   What's the point?"
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.540]   If you have that philosophy and that attitude, then they quickly – everything falls apart
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.940]   and they wind up spending more than they have.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.460]   So I'll skip the second example for now.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.100]   Go back and listen to episode 408 for more information on that.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.260]   But today I want to talk about the granularity of your spending categories.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.100]   The whole point of tracking your money is to help you make better decisions.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.260]   So you need to keep your budget categories, your transactional categories at a level of
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.740]   granularity that's appropriate for you.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:33.560]   This level of granularity will change depending on your situation and it will change over
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.580]   your life.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.340]   For today, I'm going to assume that you're just getting started.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.740]   When you're just getting started, you've made a New Year's resolution to save more
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.740]   money.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.260]   You need good tools and you're going to need to build new habits.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.940]   Once those habits are built, it's going to be less important for you to track them
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.060]   carefully and specifically.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.380]   But as you're going through the process of building those habits, you'll need to
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.340]   track things in a detailed way.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:08.660]   Almost every diet book that I've read or diet plan that I've observed has begun with
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.940]   some form of a food journal.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.540]   The food journal is a useful tool to try to figure out your baseline.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.140]   What do you currently eat?
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.620]   How do you currently eat?
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.820]   And then the diet plan or the diet coach will start to adjust that.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.180]   Now sometimes it's a whole scale adjustment and they want you to go from all the way from
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.300]   the standard American diet onto the Whole30 Cleanse diet.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.860]   Or sometimes it's a minor adjustment and the person has a philosophy and says, "Well,
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.540]   let's just start by changing out a few structural things."
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.260]   But it always starts with tracking.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:50.500]   People who are advanced in their healthy food consumption generally don't write down every
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.020]   bite of food that they eat.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.020]   There's no need for it.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.700]   That would be a poor use of the time because they've built those habits.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:05.080]   But people who are beginners need that level of granularity and that same thing with money.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.360]   If you're going to build wealth and maintain it, there will never be a point in time at
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.700]   which you can walk away from having an awareness of your budget.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.700]   Doubt me.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.320]   Just search for common celebrities who make tens of millions of dollars and a few years
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.900]   later are totally broke and bankrupt.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.540]   They're very sad stories but usually it's because they don't have a grasp on how much
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.940]   money is coming in and going out.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:36.600]   Yes, it sounds like a lot of money to earn $10 million in a year and it is.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.580]   But executive jets are not inexpensive.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.820]   It wouldn't be uncommon for somebody who maintains their own plane to spend a couple million
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.220]   bucks a year on that particular habit, not even including the purchase price.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.340]   So anything can get out of hand.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.420]   Frequently, people who earn a lot of money, if they don't keep an eye on the outgo, they
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.340]   don't have the system in place where they're going to be able to make good decisions long
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.880]   term.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.260]   So I'm about to talk about groceries.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.740]   I don't want you to think that somebody who is earning millions of dollars per year needs
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.780]   to sit down and carefully itemize their receipt for their grocery expenditures.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.500]   You don't.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.140]   But almost every millionaire I've ever interacted with or I've ever read will at least have
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:25.660]   a general idea of how much their family spends on food in a given year.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:32.120]   It can be as simple as having the end of the year Amex statement or it can be as simple
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.700]   as just sitting down with whatever is built into their bank and say, "Okay, we may have
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.380]   spent about this amount of money."
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.120]   But you need to have some idea of those categories.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.420]   When you're starting, however, a different level of granularity is helpful.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.540]   Now let's start with the basics.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.380]   A good place to start for many people in terms of tracking the money that they're spending
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.380]   so that they can make better decisions would be something as simple as differentiating
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.740]   the amount of money that they spend on groceries versus the amount of money that they spend
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.900]   dining out.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.700]   If you're just getting started, start there.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.980]   Just start tracking how much money you spend on restaurants and how much money you spend
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.460]   on groceries.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.680]   It would not be at all unusual for a family who's given to profligate spending and trying
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.560]   to cut back to discover that they're spending $1,000 a month on restaurants.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.500]   Relatively easy to do if you're not a single person but you have a habit of eating out
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.360]   consistently.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.120]   It wouldn't be unusual to spend $500 a month on restaurants.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.360]   That would be fairly common among middle-class US Americans.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.960]   The first place of specificity could be how much am I spending on restaurants versus how
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.480]   much am I spending on groceries.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.460]   You might have a goal and might make major progress just by pulling back on the number
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:56.680]   of times that you dine out and pushing over in the direction of buying groceries.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:03.400]   For somebody that's given to consistent eating out, that could save 50% on your food budget
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.120]   right there.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.260]   That would be the right place to start.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.280]   It's relatively simple.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.960]   You just have to track the difference between groceries and dining out and that can make
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   progress.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.320]   But what's the next step?
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.720]   Perhaps you've decided that you're still not happy with your performance in a certain
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   area and this is the case for me.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.160]   I've always tracked the difference between eating out and groceries.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.180]   I've always accounted for that difference but I'm unhappy with my expenditures in this
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.160]   particular area.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.680]   The next thing I need to do then is figure out what's going on.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.640]   There are different levels at which I need to figure that out.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.240]   Many of us will shop at stores like Walmart or Costco or Sam's Club or Target and these
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.280]   stores can be very challenging because they sell essentially everything.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:59.560]   If I'm looking at a bill on a bank statement or a credit card statement for Target, am
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:08.160]   I looking at a bill for groceries, new swimsuits for the children, a new GPS for my car or
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.960]   a refill card for my prepaid cell phone?
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.080]   I can't tell that by just looking at the bank statement.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:23.240]   If I'm looking at an entry for Costco, am I looking at tires, dog food, paper towels
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:30.400]   and toilet paper or cheap rolled oats that we use to make our morning oatmeal?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.840]   So let's start with that.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.600]   The first thing to do is to make sure that your tracking system is going to be differentiated
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.520]   more – on a more granular level.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.880]   This may include things that are part of your household but are not.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.640]   So the best example here is – relates to groceries.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.840]   It's very common that we'll buy paper products for the household and things like
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.680]   cleaning supplies with our groceries.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.360]   The first thing when you start trying to compare grocery budgets with people is you need to
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.040]   ask them, "Does that include things like toilet paper and paper towels or does that
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:08.360]   – and wipes for the babies or diapers or does that include just pure groceries?"
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.400]   Those categories make a big difference and many people, because they do that shopping
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.940]   concurrently, don't know the difference.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.840]   In my own accounting system last year until I really started focusing in a few months
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.080]   ago, I wasn't entirely sure that I had been perfect with separating those transactions
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   out.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.320]   It's a little bit of work to take your receipt home from Costco or from Target or from Walmart
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.440]   and actually figure out what did I spend.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.340]   Target makes it the easiest because they break it out into categories automatically.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.240]   But Walmart and Costco don't.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.520]   So you got to think about it and especially if you don't even do something like – a
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.320]   little trick that I use is make sure that – you may bring it up in separate transactions
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.900]   although I only do that if I'm purchasing things that are business expenses and personal
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.180]   expenses to make sure I have separate receipts.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.400]   If I'm purchasing printing copy paper at Costco and groceries, then I'll bring it
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.920]   up in two separate transactions for business expenses and personal expenses.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.200]   But put it on the cart – sorry, put it on the conveyor belt in an organized manner.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.960]   So keep all your food together and then if you're buying oil for your oil change and
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.600]   put that separate with the little doodad, the $100 thing that you thought would be cool
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.640]   to buy because it was advertised and then put your paper products at the end.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.080]   So that way when you get home and you analyze your receipt, you can properly enter the data.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.800]   You have to do this manually and it takes work.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.520]   But that's the first level and that's important because you might find that your
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:40.340]   $1,000 a month average is actually being caused by the $200 a month impulse expenditures that
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.520]   you make because it's a great deal on a cool thing.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.760]   For most of us who shop at those stores, Costco is the worst and the best, simultaneously
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.360]   the worst and the best.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   Why?
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.840]   The way that Costco works is they have a certain products that they always have.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.600]   Then they're always bringing in new products.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.400]   When Costco brings in a product, they'll offer a good product, a good deal, but they
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.360]   won't keep it around forever.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.280]   So you know if you think you're going to want it, you basically have to buy it now
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.320]   or come back a few days later because it's not going to be there next month.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.800]   That results in more binge buying, more impulse buying or at least a stronger temptation to
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.640]   do that.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.120]   Based upon their strategy of sizing large packages, you wind up spending more money
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.740]   than you might otherwise spend.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:32.600]   You didn't know that you were going to go shopping today for high-quality leather work
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.160]   gloves, but of course here are some and that would be useful to have.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.320]   It would be nice to have that.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   But of course it's not just one pair.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.520]   So you've got to go ahead and buy a package of three pairs or you didn't know you were
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.840]   shopping for flashlights today, but you know what?
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.320]   It would be nice to have an extra flashlight or two, but this is a set of four.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.080]   Now you got four flashlights instead of one.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.160]   That's the great temptation of some of these stores.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.000]   So it starts by breaking those things out so you can look and maybe what you find is
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.200]   you don't actually spend too much money on groceries.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.800]   What you actually spend too much money on is those impulse purchases.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.900]   That's helpful.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:16.520]   Now you can adjust your behavior by finding out what's actually going on.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:23.240]   This simple practice can solve a lot of marital stress.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:30.360]   I know I've talked to a number of husbands who get all mad at their wives and say, "Honey,
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.880]   why are we spending so much money on groceries?"
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.720]   Especially if she's – usually if she's the one who is responsible for the food budget.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   She might go through and look at it and what she actually find is that it's not the wife
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.680]   who's spending too much money on groceries.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   It's the husband who when he goes with her to Costco every other week, always find some
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.560]   new doodad, some new cool gadget and that's the problem.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   So this level of tracking granularity might bring a little bit of marital peace to your
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   household.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.900]   But you might go farther.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.440]   So I've done an OK job in the past of breaking those things out.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.560]   But I'm still not happy with my results in our grocery expenditure.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   So what I've done is I've taken things to a deeper level.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.000]   The reason that I've done this is so that I have better data to find out what's going
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.920]   on in my household so that we can make major progress.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   I won't do this forever.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.640]   But for now and probably for this entire year, I've broken things out to an even more granular
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.480]   level.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.960]   So I switched from just saying groceries to the actual categories of groceries.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:48.040]   I created in my budgeting software new categories for fruits and vegetables, meats, eggs, dairy,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:57.340]   bread, grains, coffee, alcohol, sweets, non-categorized groceries.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.200]   I put all of these things and broke all of these things out so that I can understand
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.040]   what's actually going on.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.080]   It's one thing for someone to say, "Hey, you'll save money by buying less meat."
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.280]   It's another thing to look down and realize, "Oh, you know what?
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.960]   I'm actually spending $100 a month on really nice meat that I really enjoy eating but it's
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.640]   expensive meat."
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.320]   That may be perfectly fine in your situation.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   But you may choose that decision actively.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.160]   But at least you'll have the data.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.020]   And so by breaking things out into very tangible categories, I can start to see how much am
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.760]   I spending in these different categories.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.360]   What's the percentage makeup of our budget?
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.800]   And then we can make a decision appropriately.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.520]   Now I think I have a pretty good idea of how these categories are going to shake out.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.400]   I don't think my coffee habit is costing me $20 a month.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.900]   I think it's less than that.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.180]   But the data will tell.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.320]   The categories will help me.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.480]   Now is it work to come home with a receipt and to break it out and to calculate it?
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   Yes, it is.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.960]   But that's a good thing because when you're trying to save money on something and you're
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.800]   trying to make an intentional habit, being aware of what's going on will help you.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.760]   That's the key, is awareness.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.200]   And that process of sorting out the receipt, and I want to make it simple by trying to
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.700]   group things according to my budget categories, but that process will help you to solve and
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.680]   understand what's going on.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.600]   Now I've applied similar things to things like eating out.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.200]   So we don't do a lot of eating out.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.840]   But one of the things that I've wondered is what percentage of our dining out is planned
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   versus unplanned?
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.320]   Perhaps you would do planned meals out or unplanned meals out.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   What do I mean?
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.460]   Well, there's a difference between scheduling to go out with some friends and we're going
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.440]   to go out to an intentional dining out choice.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.840]   We're going to go to a restaurant that we enjoy eating at for a specific occasion and
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.320]   we're going for the experience of eating out with friends.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.600]   That in my mind is a very different thing than arriving late in the day, everyone's
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.640]   falling apart, we don't have any food prepared and so we just have to go out and we wind
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:19.360]   up eating out just because that's what – it was a stressful situation.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.200]   And that's different than we're traveling across the state and we stop and wind up eating
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.440]   fast food instead of having food from home.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   So I've broken all of our dining out into different categories that are useful.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.040]   Meals for convenience or meals for celebration or sweets out, trying to get a tracking on
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.320]   what's actually going on.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.520]   Make up your own categories but figure out how to use a category that's going to apply
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.780]   to the thing that you're trying to accomplish.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:56.000]   If you notice yourself spending by being forced into spending by circumstances, that's the
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.140]   time at which you recognize what's going on.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.080]   You probably go ahead and make the expenditure under the circumstances in order to solve
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.720]   the crisis.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.280]   But then you've got to come back and make a new plan.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.640]   So one thing that we try to do is have food options in our house that are quick convenience
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.080]   foods that can solve that problem.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.400]   So when we don't have time to cook from scratch or we don't have time to cook something
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:30.720]   that is totally homemade or which would be usually more healthful and less expensive,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.640]   at least we have some in-between prepared foods.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.040]   If those in-between prepared foods are there, they're a whole lot easier and cheaper than
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   going out to eat.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.720]   Yes, they're more expensive than the ultimate baseline but let's solve that problem of convenience
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:51.680]   with something that is convenient but it's not as expensive as taking a whole family
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.200]   with children out to a sit-down restaurant.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.600]   Or here's another strategy that you could use.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.040]   Perhaps your particular situation doesn't involve wanting to have convenience foods
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   at home.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.280]   But can you think through where you would go and what you would do to have convenient
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.780]   but less expensive restaurant food?
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.960]   You can put together a strategy that allows you to dine out – actually out but does
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   it cheaper.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   So here would be my example.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.800]   I think the best value, at least with restaurants around me and I'm blessed to have many,
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.680]   but I think the best value for this type of thing is Chipotle.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.720]   At least at Chipotle, I can get – it's a quick-serve restaurant.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.600]   We can be served quickly.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.680]   It's healthy food.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.080]   It's basic whole food.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.840]   It's not weird stuff that I don't know all of the ingredients that are in it.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.440]   It's essential food of decent quality.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.720]   I'm a burrito bowl fan.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.280]   I think a burrito bowl is the best deal out there.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.800]   Half of a burrito bowl will fill me up and feed me.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   It works well with the children.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.440]   It's a sit-down restaurant.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.520]   We have a sit-down restaurant but there's no tip required, which adds 20 percent to
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.200]   a standard restaurant bill.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.000]   So I can think about that and I can say, "All right.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.600]   Well, our plan for when we need one of those crisis meals is going to be Chipotle."
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.880]   So thinking in advance, recognizing the triggering event, perhaps you may go online and go ahead
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.520]   and purchase some Chipotle gift cards from one of the gift card swap sites and get yourself
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.560]   a discount, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 percent discount on Chipotle cards and you go ahead and purchase
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.960]   some of those and have those ready to go.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:30.120]   Now the next time it's Thursday night, everyone's hot, everyone's tired and you need to go
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.080]   out, you've got a plan.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.720]   Another triggering event from our lifestyle is traveling.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.440]   When traveling with children, everyone starts to get tired.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.880]   Everyone starts to get hot and just done and needing some food.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.360]   And often when we're traveling, we're trying to go at an in-between time.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.320]   So I've been annoyed and frustrated at times where we wind up having a big fast food bill
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.520]   when it's not particularly the quality of food that I'd like to have and it's not particularly
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.780]   the price of food that I'd like to have.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.400]   So got to solve it.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   Got to make a plan.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   Well, what do we need?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.800]   How do we eat on the road?
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   What convenient food can we have that will solve the problem and how can we stock up
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.880]   in advance?
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.440]   So then the solution becomes purchasing some car snacks or some things that are always
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.800]   available, adding to our packing checklist when we're leaving, what food are we going
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.640]   to have available so we can avoid a $20 fast food stop.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.200]   These are all examples from the world of food, but the same principle applies to other areas.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   In order for you to make measurable progress, you usually have to get more granular in your
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   analysis.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.160]   You've decided that you'd like to save money on electricity.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.320]   Great.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   How do you do that?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.280]   Well, you can flip some lights off here and there, but then you might be a little bit
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:54.380]   annoyed when your bill next month is still only $2 less than it was the month before.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.000]   If you're going to save money on electricity, you start with analysis.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.640]   Here's how I would do that if I were doing it for you.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.400]   We go around your house and we try to identify all of the users of electricity.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.240]   We try to figure out if – to the best we can, what's going to make the biggest impact.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.200]   Now in the world of electricity, there's going to be the big ones and the little ones.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.600]   Some of the big ones you can change or maybe willing to change and some of them you may
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   not.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.480]   But let's go ahead and we would make a list of all of those things.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.840]   So I would start with things like appliances, the air conditioning or if you have an electric
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   heater, electric heat, the dishwasher, the washing machine, the electric clothes dryer,
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   the electric water heater.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.680]   Then you go to different things that are around the house, the microwave, the lights, the
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.280]   fans, etc.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.160]   If possible, if you can get the data, for example, it's relatively easy to calculate
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.840]   the light draw of a lamp.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.600]   You can either do it based upon the bulb or you can get yourself a kilowatt meter and
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:03.120]   plug it in and that's a brand name, Kilwatt, W-A-T-T.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.480]   Get yourself one of those little devices and plug it in and measure the actual power draw
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.560]   of it.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.960]   Measure the power draw of your toaster.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.600]   And then you can start and start to implement different strategies.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:22.520]   One strategy may be how do I kill the phantom power draw of my TV, my cable box, my internet
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.720]   when I'm not using it.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.440]   Trot down to Harbor Freight, grab a couple of dollar power strips, plug it in where you
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.080]   have an off switch and install a new habit into your life where when you're done watching
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.240]   TV or when you're done with the computer, go ahead and flip the switch and completely
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.080]   kill the outlet to stop the phantom power load.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.960]   That'll save you a little bit but every little bit counts.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.720]   So learning about the phantom power load and calculating the phantom power load will help
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.520]   you to cut your electricity bill.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.360]   You may go through and install a new habit into yourself and your family of turning off
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.320]   lights when you're not using them.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.640]   And actually doing that will start to save you some money.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.360]   You may change out some of your lamps for slightly lower wattage bulbs or you may go
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:16.040]   ahead and upgrade the bulbs in your house and move from incandescent into CFL or LED
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.600]   or upgrade your CFL bulbs when they go to LED.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.840]   On that case, your way of cutting is you're going to start shopping, find a good deal
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.720]   on LED bulbs and start purchasing them using some of the discount purchase strategies and
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.080]   swap those out.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.080]   That'll be helpful to you.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.800]   That'll save you money.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.760]   And then you may look at each of your appliances and you may start to do an analysis there.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   Perhaps you're – I'm not about to start washing my clothes by hand to save money on
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.560]   electricity on my washing machine.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   That's a big deal.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.320]   But you could run the washing machine with a full load instead of with a partial load.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.560]   So instead of doing your laundry so frequently with small loads, purchase a few more clothes
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.040]   so that you can get it through and run it with a full load.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.780]   That may be more efficient.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:02.120]   With your electric clothes dryer, you go down and you string up a clothesline outside and
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   you either dry your clothes fully in the sunshine or if you need them to be fluffed and softened,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.200]   dry them mostly in the sunshine and then just finish them up in the dryer.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.800]   That will save you electricity.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.440]   Or install a clothesline inside.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.160]   If you don't want to leave your clothes out through the freezing winter and have them
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.940]   freeze themselves dry as our great-grandparents did, go ahead and install one somewhere else
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.800]   in your house, in your bathroom, in your garage or in some way where you can dry the clothes
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.880]   at least partially inside instead of just constantly using the electric clothes dryer.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.640]   That would be a strategy for drying clothes.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.680]   Your water heater, maybe you turn down the temperature.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.240]   Your safe operating temperature on your water heater needs to be 120 degrees.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.000]   It always needs to be hot enough in order to kill bacteria.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   But you may turn it down.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.880]   There's no reason for it to be 150.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.960]   Turn it down to 120 degrees.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.740]   Perhaps you can go and purchase an insulating blanket to install – and install better
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.560]   insulation on your water heater or perhaps it's time to go ahead and upgrade your water
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:04.440]   heater to an instant hot water heater, electric or gas, or one that's more energy efficient.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.240]   Do the calculations and figure out if that's the right move.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.800]   With your air conditioner, perhaps this is the time to go ahead and have spray foam insulation
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.240]   sprayed into your attic or to upgrade the actual air conditioner or just to get a new
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   thermostat.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:23.060]   Instead of having a standard thermostat, you will go ahead and install a smart thermostat
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:30.560]   which will help you to save money by changing the rating, the thermostat rating at a time
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.560]   that you don't use it.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.840]   Or go ahead and install some fans.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.880]   If you'll install a fan and put a fan by your feet at your desk or install a ceiling
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:44.680]   fan in your bedroom, you'll be able to be more comfortable by having some circulation
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   of the air which takes the heat away from your skin.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.800]   You'll be able to be more comfortable at a higher temperature on the air conditioner.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.480]   Or perhaps you can install a window unit into your bedroom and at night when you are in
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.000]   your bedroom, you turn off the central AC and you just simply use your window unit.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   The point of these discussions is to give you specific practical ideas to save on your
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.880]   electric bill but also to demonstrate to you a method of analysis wherein you break things
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:21.600]   down based upon their category so that you can figure out the tricks to apply to savings.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.360]   One more on the electric bill.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.400]   The reason I'm doing this is that your electric bill is not something that you can really
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.000]   beautifully itemize sometimes.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.880]   Sometimes your electric bill is just an electric bill and if you just – you have your canceled
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.320]   check or the line on your bank statement that says electric bill.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.760]   So you're not going to use this method of detailed analysis in your budgeting software
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.120]   but you can use this in your analysis if you look at it the way that I've done.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.780]   You would analyze your actual electric bill in terms of the things that might be available
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.720]   from your electric company.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.600]   With our electric company, they offer something where if you sign up for their overflow program,
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.280]   forget the name of it, they'll give you a discount on your bill.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.440]   So they install a switch in your house and by installing that switch, they have the option
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.620]   to turn off a couple of your major appliances during times of high load.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.040]   For us, it's the summertime when it's very hot.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:21.480]   They have the option of turning off your circuits to your air conditioning in order to keep
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.560]   their grid working effectively and well.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.960]   There's a savings for that and because of that savings being there, it's worth it.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.000]   In my experience after years of having this in the houses that I've lived in, I'm
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.120]   not aware of any time they've actually used it.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.080]   But it's a good savings mechanism to lower and get a discount on your bill.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.980]   Or another example would be if your electric company may offer a difference of peak versus
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:52.560]   non-peak billing and they'll bill you instead of having a flat rate for 24 hours a day,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.800]   they'll bill you a higher or a lower rate based upon peak usage.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.160]   Well, analyze your usage.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.960]   Usually they'll help you do this and you may be able to change some of your usage patterns
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:10.080]   in order to use electricity at off-peak numbers versus the peak debt times.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.160]   If you might do laundry at nighttime instead of during the daytime.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.880]   Here in Florida, the peak hours are during the daytime when there's the giant load
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.760]   for air conditioner – for an air conditioning.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.440]   If your house is empty because you're at your office all day, there's no reason
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.360]   for you not to go ahead and participate in that program.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.920]   You can leave your air conditioning off or turned up while you're away at work and
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.240]   then when you come home, that's the time that you turn your air conditioning on, start
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   your electric stove.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.920]   That's the time that you wash your laundry and dry it anyway.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.160]   So why not take the savings and use the off-peak hours?
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.560]   You have the ability to do this for every category of your budget.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.280]   I'm not going to go through every category.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.740]   I'm going to encourage you to do it.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:02.060]   But the point is for you to take and think in advance about the things that are impacting
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.320]   your budget.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.800]   I'll give you one last final category example.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:14.400]   With your giving and your gift, I think you should track that.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.040]   But I think you should have a level of granularity that doesn't just say giving because there
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:25.560]   are some types of giving that you can minimize the cost of without minimizing the impact
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.260]   and the effect.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:36.420]   If you're giving your money directly, that should be tracked and that should be tracked
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.300]   so for your own personal accountability.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:46.740]   If you are tithing to your local church, that's a dollar financial contribution that comes
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.940]   right off the top of your budget and so that should be counted as tithe.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.820]   A tithe is not to your local church.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.460]   A tithe is not a three percent.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.820]   That's a ten percent of your income into your local church.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:07.100]   Similarly, that's not a contribution to your favorite animal charity.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.100]   Perhaps you want to support your favorite animal charity but that should be reflected
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.060]   as a different category.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:16.940]   Now that type of giving or giving personally to people who are in need, giving them cash,
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:23.620]   that type of giving is different than the giving of gifts at scheduled occasions such
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.660]   as Christmas gifts or birthday gifts.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.140]   For many people, this is one of those challenges especially when you have children and your
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.720]   children have friends.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.860]   It can be expensive to develop birthday gifts.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.020]   Well, plan ahead.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:43.060]   Develop a category called birthday gifts in your budget tracking system so that you are
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:49.300]   aware of how much money you're actually spending on the birthday gifts for your friends.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.220]   Depending on age appropriateness, you can start to plan ahead.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:59.220]   When my wife was growing up, her mom always maintained a birthday box, a box of toys and
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.900]   gifts that were new, freshly available but that were purchased on discount and clearance
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.740]   and they were always available so that when there was a birthday invitation, then they
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.740]   always had a box.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.900]   Just go to the birthday box, grab a present and that way it will pass that along as a
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.420]   birthday gift.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.780]   But you can buy those presents during the after Christmas sale and get them for 20 cents
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.620]   on the dollar.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.980]   That's a good way of cutting back on your birthday expenses.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.580]   You need to isolate what's the problem.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.740]   The problem is birthday gifts.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.740]   Do I want to participate?
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.140]   For most of us, yes, I want to participate.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.180]   Giving a birthday gift is valuable.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.300]   But participating doesn't mean I have to go out at the last minute and pay full retail
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.900]   price for some piece of plastic.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:48.580]   I can participate in a way that is more sensible and is done in advance.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:54.380]   Check it out appropriately to help you analyze ways to save money.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:00.200]   The business philosopher and theorist Peter Drucker famously said, "What gets measured
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   gets managed."
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:08.700]   That's perfectly true in the world of finance.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.260]   What gets measured gets managed.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:18.380]   Finance is perhaps the ultimate expression of this because we're dealing with numbers
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.540]   in and of themselves and it's easy to measure those things.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.380]   But measure them across your budget.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:29.220]   Don't fall prey to the idea of, "Oh, I'm just good enough to figure it out."
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.220]   Guess what?
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.220]   You're not.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.860]   You're not.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:40.260]   Nobody is that consistent and that in tune with what's going on in their life mathematically
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.900]   that they can just figure it out.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.860]   You need to have a baseline of measurement.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:53.420]   Now, recognize that there will be growth but look at some area of your budget this month
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:59.100]   and start measuring it so that you can manage it and so that you can improve it.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.300]   Whether this is at the small end of measuring how much money you're spending on meat, how
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.940]   much money you're spending on fruit and veggies, and how much money you're spending on the
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.380]   sales tax of your food.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.340]   That's not a category that I maintain, a sales tax.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.180]   It's interesting because by making different choices, make your own granola.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.660]   You can buy raw food and there's no sales tax.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.700]   Make by the pre-made granola and you pay sales tax on it.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.260]   It's where I live in a sales tax state.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.260]   That's a 6% savings.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.420]   Right there, it just has an example.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.940]   So whether it's at the small end of your food or your electric usage or your mortgage and
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.620]   figuring out how much money you're paying interest and you go to the market and you
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.940]   shop it or whether it's looking at your investment portfolio and going through and calculating
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.800]   the expense ratio on your mutual funds and calculating the mortality and expense charges
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.380]   on your annuities and on your life insurance policies or on your disability insurance or
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.800]   your car insurance, what gets measured gets managed.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.500]   You can't measure everything all the time or at least I think very few people can do
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   that.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.980]   Many people, they just don't enjoy the minutiae enough to do that.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.980]   You might.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   I do.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   I enjoy the minutiae.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.340]   But you can measure it in specific points at a time and establish a baseline.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.060]   And once you've established a baseline of comfort level, then you can start to improve
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.540]   things from there.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.980]   So get detailed with your budget.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:23.500]   Your tracking is there to serve you, not to do just because it's objectively good.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.820]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.260]   I hope this has been useful to you.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.020]   I think this will be my last one on this theme for a little while unless I have something
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.020]   else to share.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.940]   We'll move on to more topics in the future.
