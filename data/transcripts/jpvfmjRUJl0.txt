[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   Well, it seems we see signs and wonders and miracles all over our Bibles.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.080]   But for many of us, we see an absence of signs, wonders, and miracles in our own lives and
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.240]   in the world around us.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.620]   So where did the wonders go?
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.560]   It's a question from a college student who writes in to ask us this.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560]   Pastor John, thank you for the wonderful podcast.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.520]   I listen regularly.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.400]   I'm a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.640]   My parents are missionaries in the Republic of Georgia.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.400]   I have spent some time on the mission field with them as well.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.460]   Living on a very secular campus now is obviously a night and day difference from the mission
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.460]   field.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.800]   And as I talk to my classmates about faith, life, and Christianity in general, one question
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680]   that my friends often ask me is this one.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.760]   Why doesn't God work overt miracles today in 21st century America like He did in both
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.520]   the Old and New Testaments?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.400]   Doesn't it seem convenient that God only worked miracles in the Bible?
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.820]   Pastor John, how would you answer this objection to the faith?
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.280]   My answer to this is fairly simple.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.840]   It's this.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.320]   There were fewer miracles in the Bible than you probably think.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.800]   And there are more miracles today than you probably know.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.000]   And there is a good biblical reason for why there would be a certain kind of prevalence
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.240]   of miracles in the Bible that is different from today.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.640]   So let me say a word about each of those three observations.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.880]   Think about the Old Testament.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   Here's a typical statement.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.560]   The psalmist says in Psalm 77, verse 11, "I will remember the deeds of the Lord.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.880]   Yes, I will remember your wonders of old."
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.680]   When you read the Old Testament, you realize most of the saints in most of those centuries
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.840]   would have talked like that.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440]   The wonders of old.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.140]   Oh, remember the wonders of old.
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.340]   And they would have had the same question we do.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.200]   Why were there more miracles in the days of Elijah, in the days of Moses, than there are
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.640]   today, in the days of the prophets, in the days of the kings?
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.400]   So it's simply a great mistake to think that there are miracles running all through the
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.280]   history of God's people as the Bible records it.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.300]   They were not running all through the history of God's people.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.360]   They sprung up around certain periods of time, like the Exodus and like the ministries of
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.920]   Elijah and Elisha.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.320]   But most of the time, the saints of the Old Testament were living their lives by faith
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   in the promises of God for the future, rooted in the past wonders of God that he had worked
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.800]   in the past, just the way we live our lives today, by faith in the promises of God for
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.520]   a kingdom that's yet to be consummated by looking back to the decisive work of Jesus
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.400]   Christ in the Bible.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.520]   And when it comes to the New Testament, it is gloriously true that Jesus did miracles
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.560]   perfectly and consistently, though even he only raised three people from the dead and
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.000]   didn't heal people in many places where he traveled or where he didn't travel.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.480]   The miracles of Jesus were clearly not to show that the kingdom had been consummated,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.200]   but only to show that the kingdom had broken into the world, in part, pointing to a future
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   day when everybody would be raised from the dead who believes in Christ and nobody would
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.320]   be sick anymore in the coming kingdom, because that's the way Jesus is, and he's showing
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.720]   some of that now.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.520]   And not only that, but Jesus himself explains his own miracles as pointing to his divinity.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.760]   In other words, something about these miracles attached to him, and you wouldn't expect them
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.240]   to attach to other people in the same way.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   For example, he said in John 10:37, "If I am not doing the works of my Father, then
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.920]   do not believe me."
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.800]   In other words, "Whoa, these works are good evidence that I am in the Father and the Father
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.040]   is in me.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.440]   I'm unique, Son of God."
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.560]   And this is true, even though he gave his disciples authority to do miracles also.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.040]   They knew that there was something utterly unique about this man and the way he did miracles,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.960]   and that the authority and power uniquely resided in him as the very Son of God.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.840]   And when you turn to the book of Acts and the rest of the New Testament, the epistles,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.680]   it's obvious that the apostles did some astonishing miracles, but it's also true that they suffered
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.320]   much and their colleagues got sick.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.380]   They neededâ€”Paul carried a doctor around with him.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.080]   But they got thrown into prison, that they got killed.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.420]   And even though there were gifts of miracles and gifts of healing and gifts of exorcism
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.880]   that are spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12, it would be a huge stretch to think that the
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:47.380]   Christians with those gifts in the first century were performing miracles the way Jesus did.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.560]   So already in the first century, outside the life of Jesus, things had changed.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.480]   So my first observation is that we shouldn't think of the Bible times, either Old or New
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.540]   Testament, as times in which saints of God consistently did miracles.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.020]   That would be a distortion of the biblical record.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.960]   They were few and far between in the Old Testament.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.840]   They were uniquely concentrated in Jesus in a very special Christ-exalting way, and his
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:30.240]   apostles, and they were shared in part through spiritual gifts with all the saints.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.680]   And the second observation I would make is that there are probably more miracles happening
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.920]   today than we realize.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.940]   If we could collect all the authentic stories all over the world from all the missionaries
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.840]   and all the saints in all the countries of the world, all the cultures of the world,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.380]   all the millions of encounters between Christians and demons and Christians and sickness, and
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:10.040]   all the so-called coincidences of the world, we would be stunned and think we were living
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.760]   in a world of miracles, which we are.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.200]   And the third observation I would make, and this is probably what I would say to the unbeliever
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:28.160]   who is challenging me, the heart of Christianity is not that the kingdom has fully come and
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.120]   all sin and evil is being overcome now in this age.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.840]   The heart of Christianity is that Christ Jesus, the Son of God, came into the world at a point
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:45.200]   in history, in the past, to reveal what God is like and to accomplish salvation for all
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.320]   who believe in him by dying and rising again.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.800]   Miracles clustered around that appearance in history, in Jesus, and in the life of the
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   apostles to vindicate his claim and their writings.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:08.680]   And Christianity is basically a life lived by looking back with confidence in the work
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.440]   of Christ and looking forward in hope because of that past to a consummation that's coming
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:21.240]   and being willing to suffer and love people now and call them to that faith.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.000]   And so we live in a period of time precisely where suffering is normal.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.360]   And nevertheless, God does continually here, now and then, sometimes regularly in periods
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:44.120]   of revival, use his power to perform, according to his sovereign will, miracles for his people.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:51.320]   Why he doesn't do it more now than he does is partly perhaps owing to our lack of expectancy
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:58.680]   and faith, but is ultimately owing to his sovereign decree.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.120]   When we call people to repent and believe, we're not calling them to do this on the basis
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.440]   of a miracle they saw yesterday, even if it happened, but on the basis of the glory of
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:18.200]   Jesus Christ revealed in his death and resurrection through Scripture.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.760]   That's the basis.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.240]   And even if miracles were happening more today, that's where the foundation of faith would
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   need to lie.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.240]   Amen.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   There's a lot to think about here, especially with how you led off this episode, that there
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.760]   were fewer miracles in the Bible than you probably think and more miracles today than
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   you probably know.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   That's really thoughtful.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.240]   I'll be thinking about that today.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.040]   And thanks for making the Ask Pastor John podcast part of your day.

[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.840]   How do we not lose our faith when we lose our confidence in our local church?
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.280]   Or how do we not lose our faith when we feel neglected or pushed out of a local church
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.280]   community?
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.200]   It is a really sharp question from a listener and it's on the docket for next time on Wednesday.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.240]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
