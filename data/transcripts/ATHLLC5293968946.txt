[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.400]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.480]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.120]   and it's been a while since I did a solo mailbag episode,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.640]   and that's long overdue,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.320]   but I am so excited for this one
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.480]   because I think the timing will be so helpful
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.960]   for anyone who has upcoming travel these holidays,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.280]   because I'm gonna cover everything you need to know
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.300]   when things go wrong with your travel.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.760]   That means delays, cancellations, missed flights,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.000]   sold out hotels and rental cars,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.140]   some preventative measures you should take, and a lot more.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.560]   I'm also gonna cover a few other travel topics,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   including some recent news and deals,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.780]   tips for earning companion pass for two years,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.560]   a card that earns three X points on everything for a year,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.080]   and a lot more.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.720]   But before we jump in,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.080]   I wanna share that our annual listener survey
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   is live as of today at allthehacks.com/survey,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.040]   where it's linked in the show notes,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.520]   and it would absolutely mean the world to me
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.800]   if you could spend a few minutes to take it.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.120]   Your feedback is one of the major ways
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440]   I'm gonna decide how we focus all of our time and energy
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.480]   with all the hacks next year.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.920]   However, I wanna give you a little more incentive
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.040]   to help out, so we have three incredible giveaways
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.340]   for this year's survey.
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.800]   First, we have a $100 gift card to Viore,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.720]   a longtime partner of the show,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.440]   and currently at least 50% of my weekly wardrobe,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.480]   thanks to them having the most comfortable
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.400]   performance apparel in the world.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.120]   Seriously, I'm wearing it almost every single day,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.520]   and if you can't wait for the giveaway,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.200]   go to allthehacks.com/viore to get 20% off your order.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.400]   Next, we have a free "Any Day, Every Day" cookware set.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920]   And if you're not familiar with "Any Day,"
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.120]   go back and listen to episode 122,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.840]   where Chef David Chang and I talked about "Any Day,"
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   and how it's completely changed our home cooking game
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200]   by unlocking the power of the microwave.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.940]   We use our "Any Day" cookware almost every single day,
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.020]   so if you wanna check them out,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.600]   you can go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   and get 15% off your purchase.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.880]   Finally, for me and Amy at All The Hacks,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.600]   we're giving away a round-trip economy class certificate
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000]   on United, valid for travel to or from the U.S.,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.360]   excluding Hawaii, valid for travel to and from
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.040]   the 48 United States, Alaska, Canada,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.500]   Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.800]   So I really hope someone takes an epic adventure with that.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   Please consider taking a few minutes
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.600]   to take the survey this week at allthehacks.com/survey.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120]   I would really appreciate it,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320]   and we'll be emailing the giveaway winners in a few weeks.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.280]   Okay, there is so much good stuff
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.880]   to cover in today's episode,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.980]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.180]   Oh, and one more thing.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.500]   I got 20 free download codes for the new movie "Dumb Money,"
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.920]   which I'm gonna talk about in the outro of today's episode,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.320]   so keep listening for that.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.760]   Our sponsor today, Trade Coffee,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.640]   can help you nail holiday gift-giving this year.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.040]   A subscription to Trade is the perfect gift

[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.320]   You just choose how much to spend,

[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   cut out the worry around shipping deadlines

[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.160]   Trade is a subscription service
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.000]   that sources the best coffee around the country
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and brings it to your doorstep.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.120]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   from the comfort of your own home.

[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.280]   and the Huckleberry Roasters coffee
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.620]   we got recently was amazing.

[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.440]   Allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.560]   Okay, so I wanted to do this episode
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.880]   because, well, first, so many of you have emailed
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.480]   asking questions about this topic,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.680]   but also because there's a lot of holiday travel coming up
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.160]   and I really wanna make sure you all are prepared,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.880]   but this information isn't just holiday specific.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   So it should be helpful to anyone
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.960]   who has plans to travel in the future,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.840]   which I hope is just about everyone listening.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   So let's start with a couple general tips.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.800]   First, keep in mind whenever you're in a tricky situation,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.640]   three P's, patient, polite, and persistent.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.920]   Whoever you're dealing with is probably dealing
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.360]   with tons of passengers problems or other guests problems
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.080]   and might only have limited information for you.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.880]   So using things like please and thank you
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.480]   and just generally being nice,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.040]   I think is one of the most valuable tactics
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.400]   for making sure that you have a good outcome.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.000]   And if you know you're in the right
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.520]   and their rep who you're working with
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.280]   isn't doing enough to fix things,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.720]   I'd say hold your ground, speak to their manager,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.040]   or just try again.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.200]   The persistent thing doesn't always mean
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   sticking with the same person.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840]   If I'm calling up an airline
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.200]   and someone isn't able to help
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.760]   and I just think I'm getting nowhere,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.200]   I'll just hang up, call again,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.280]   and see if I can get someone else.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.080]   The next broad thing I wanna remind you about
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.720]   is credit card benefits.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.360]   So there are a lot of credit card benefits
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.960]   I'll talk about in this episode
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   because there are so many travel perks
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.160]   that you get with your credit cards,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.840]   but I'm not gonna go through all the nuance and detail.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.040]   So episode 113 of all the hacks
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.400]   was about all the hidden credit card benefits.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000]   So if you wanna go deeper on that topic, you can go there.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.640]   And then on insurance,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.200]   we're gonna talk a little bit about travel insurance,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.040]   but I've done two episodes covering the topic in the past,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.000]   so I just wanna point you that direction.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.280]   Episode 104 was all about insurance,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.320]   and at the end, we covered travel.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.760]   And then episode 110 with Nomadic Matt,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.360]   about 35 minutes in, we talked about travel.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.040]   My general thought on travel insurance
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.320]   is that make sure you're not paying for something
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.360]   that you already get from your credit cards.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.320]   You'll need to go on a per credit card basis
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   to see what's going on and what's offered,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.320]   but many credit cards cover a lot of things.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.560]   However, if you're going on something specialized,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.680]   if you're going on a cruise and you wanna make sure
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.560]   that you're gonna get a refund for something expensive,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.480]   if you're trying to cover a unique sport,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.600]   or you're really worried if another pandemic kicks up,
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.400]   all of those things might be worth
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   a more detailed look at travel insurance.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.880]   I'm not gonna get too deep in there,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.080]   but I just wanted to flag that up front.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.280]   And for anytime I mention an episode, if it's episode 66,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.000]   feel free to just go to allthehacks.com/66,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.480]   and that'll take you straight to the page for the episode.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.360]   If you click the link for Spotify or Apple Podcasts,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   it'll jump you right to the episode within those apps.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.760]   For other apps, you're gonna have to scroll
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.960]   and search for it, but hopefully that's helpful.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.240]   All right, let's start with air travel.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.640]   And there is a lot here.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.400]   So first, I'm gonna talk about cancellations and delays.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.240]   Before you go into any of these situations,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.680]   I would say there are a few things
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.480]   that you can do to prepare.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.080]   So one is just making sure you know what's covered.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.520]   So look at your credit card, look at the airline policies,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.660]   anything like that.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.040]   I always try to monitor my booking
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.800]   just to see what's happening as early as possible.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.060]   Time is really, really helpful in these circumstances.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.080]   So I use an app called Flighty, which is amazing,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.240]   and I get push notifications from them
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.200]   as soon as the schedule's changed.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.980]   Oftentimes, I've gotten notifications sooner
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.600]   than I got them from the airline, from Flighty.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.160]   I recently signed up again for TripIt Pro,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.260]   which right now is about $40 a year.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.120]   I think Flighty's about the same price, around $50 a year.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.800]   But the thing that I'm interested in TripIt Pro,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.520]   which I'll get to later in this conversation,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.360]   is around price drops.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.760]   But they also have monitoring,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.680]   and I'm gonna be curious to compare Flighty and TripIt Pro
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.280]   and the airlines the next time we're leaving.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.220]   The other thing for really important travel,
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.540]   time-sensitive events, is booking a backup.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.760]   And now, in a world where there are free cancellations,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.840]   I think it's really, really worth doing
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.960]   if something's really urgent or timely.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.060]   For example, for this Thanksgiving,
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.560]   we had a really, really early morning flight,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.860]   and we decided we weren't gonna take it
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.920]   because it's just gonna be a little too crazy.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.800]   So we booked a little bit of a later flight,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.600]   but the first flight was on Southwest, so I just kept it.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.640]   We booked it with points.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   I know if I cancel it, I'll get the points back
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.760]   as long as I cancel it 10 minutes before the flight takes off
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.400]   and so we'll just leave it there.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.640]   On the off chance the flight we are taking
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.320]   gets canceled sometime before schedule changes something,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.680]   we've got that backup.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.360]   I don't always book a backup,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.760]   but especially if I make changes,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.060]   I might as well keep it because it's already there.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.120]   But if you have something really time-sensitive,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   I think booking something that comes with free cancellations
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.700]   or totally refundable is something you could do
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.120]   to protect yourself.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.360]   But that's what you can do in advance.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.680]   What do you do when you find out
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.340]   that your flight is canceled or there's a delay?
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.680]   Well, in some cases, it can be a huge bummer,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.380]   especially if you're right at the airport
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.000]   and it's messing all your plans.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.040]   But if this happens in advance, it can be a huge advantage
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.960]   because when your flights get canceled or changed,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.600]   the airlines have to help you.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.360]   So sometimes that could mean
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.880]   you're gonna miss your connection that you had booked
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.280]   because it was way cheaper than a direct flight
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.000]   and you can use that to get on a direct flight.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.420]   So what you're gonna do is you're gonna wanna get in touch
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.520]   with the airline as soon as possible.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.440]   Bypassing all of the phone menus to reach a human
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.800]   is something that I think will be helpful.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.640]   So here's how I think about it.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.800]   I call and I say existing reservation
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   depending on the airline,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.720]   and I almost always just say agent
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.060]   or press zero until someone answers.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.800]   Every now and then, maybe it's weather,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.080]   maybe it's a technical system for an airline,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.680]   and you just aren't gonna get a human
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.460]   and there's really long hold times.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.760]   Whenever that happens,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.600]   I try to call one of those airline desks in another country.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.280]   So for example, if you're flying on United,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.140]   United has desks in Japan, in the UK.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.720]   You could call those numbers
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.200]   for usually a very nominal fee
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.680]   using a service like Google Voice.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.600]   I think it's usually like a cent a minute.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   Some plans, if you have US Mobile, for example,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.080]   just include free international calling.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.780]   So that is where I go if I'm not having any luck.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.360]   It's also a tactic I use if I'm trying to get an agent
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.640]   outside of business hours in the US.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.620]   And if you're at the airport
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.280]   and there's a massive line at the gate,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.000]   some airports have customer service desks.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.160]   And if that doesn't work,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.000]   there's usually reps that can help you
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.700]   inside of an airline lounge.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.000]   So if you have access to the United Club,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.180]   when you're flying United, you could go in there.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.000]   Worst case, if security wasn't that long
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.800]   and you wanted to talk to someone faster,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.820]   you could leave security
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.240]   and go to one of the ticketing desks
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.520]   and the check-in desks.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.160]   So basically the goal here
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.360]   is to get a person as fast as possible.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.040]   If you're 50th in line,
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.760]   there are 49 people that are gonna get a flight rebooked
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.320]   on something else before you.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.920]   So if you can get on the phone to someone
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.600]   or get to a person sooner,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.080]   you're gonna have a higher likelihood
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.260]   of getting a better option.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.120]   So that's how you get your flights changed.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.740]   But as far as compensation,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.520]   when an airline cancels the flight
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.920]   or makes a significant change,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.200]   you're gonna be able to get a refund for sure,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.840]   even on a non-refundable ticket.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.460]   That's according to U.S. Department of Transportation rules.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.280]   That's also true if the airline moves you
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.080]   to a lower class of service.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.560]   If you were flying in business class
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.840]   and a flight was changed,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.900]   and that meant that there weren't enough business class seats
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.200]   and you got bumped down.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.400]   But usually you can actually get a bit more compensation
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.480]   than just a refund,
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.760]   especially if you're not canceling entirely on the airline.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.540]   If you're willing to let them put you on another flight,
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.820]   sometimes that's $100.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.780]   Sometimes that's an upgrade to first class.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.140]   Sometimes that's 20,000 miles.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.340]   Sometimes it's $500.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.500]   It really depends.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.980]   But I would absolutely,
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.780]   anytime an airline is inconveniencing you,
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.640]   ask them for something for that inconvenience.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.900]   Even if they don't give you something in the moment,
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.340]   I would follow up by email,
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.920]   follow up by a phone call,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.580]   and you'd be surprised what happens.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.060]   I know right now we just booked flights next year on Delta,
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.440]   and we took $375 off those flights
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.680]   because we had $325 certificates from Delta
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.320]   because there was a major change
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.580]   to a reservation we had earlier this year.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.820]   Also, if missing the flight is your fault,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.120]   there's this thing that I just recently learned
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.280]   when doing some research called the flat tire rule,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.800]   where most airlines have some rule
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.680]   that will help you get on another flight,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.860]   whether it's a rule or just a common practice,
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.280]   if you miss the flight.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.560]   So on American, if you arrive within two hours,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.280]   you can get booked on the next flight as a standby traveler
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.800]   with no extra fees.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.540]   One time, I went to the wrong airport in the DC area.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.560]   I was supposed to go to Reagan National Airport,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.340]   and I went to Dulles, and I was able to get on a flight.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.840]   I can't even remember what airline it was,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   but it was one that flew to both DC airports,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.240]   so I was lucky there.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.880]   So I would say, if you're gonna run late
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.480]   and you're gonna miss your flight,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.660]   at least try calling before you get there,
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.640]   but I'd say you probably have a decent likelihood
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.720]   of being able to stand by.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.960]   That doesn't mean you're gonna get on,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.880]   but you probably have a good option.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.680]   And if all of these things happen
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.120]   and you're really struggling
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.240]   and you need to buy something last minute,
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.840]   I'll just throw out there that last minute flights
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.280]   using points and miles can sometimes, not always,
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.700]   but sometimes be a really great deal.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.420]   So Drew wrote in talking about
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.320]   how he had this exact situation.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.620]   He was going on a trip for work
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.520]   that he was linking together with a personal trip
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.440]   and the work side of it canceled.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.320]   So they actually canceled his ticket back home,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.860]   and he was about to be stuck buying a $387 plane ticket,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.640]   but using American Airlines points,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.080]   he was able to get that same flight for 7,500 points,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.860]   which is 5 cents per point in value, which is awesome.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.840]   And while I usually try to save my points
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.120]   for big trips that I'm planning in advance
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.360]   and business class and premium cabins,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.240]   if something happens on a domestic trip
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.160]   and last minute you need to use some miles,
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.800]   it can be a great way to use up some miles
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.760]   in a program that you don't have a huge balance on.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.020]   So that 7,500 miles that Drew needed for his flight
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.620]   is something that you might have
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.040]   in an airline you don't fly that often
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.840]   that might be able to be a great way to use those points.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.520]   As I'm dialing in my health,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.200]   I'm starting to see firsthand how important it is
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.680]   to replenish electrolytes, which is why I love Element,
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.020]   an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great,
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.620]   has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.240]   That means lots of salt with no sugar,
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.060]   and I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.080]   It contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.220]   1,000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.200]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.840]   And if you don't already know why electrolytes are important,
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.900]   don't worry, I didn't either,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.800]   but they facilitate hundreds of functions in the body,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.860]   including the conduction of nerve impulses,
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.460]   hormone regulation, nutrient absorption, and fluid balance.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.540]   Since I've been using Element,
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.160]   I've noticed a stark improvement in my recovery,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.780]   but Element can also help with other common symptoms
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.980]   of electrolyte deficiency like headaches,
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.620]   muscle cramps, fatigue, and sleepiness.

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.340]   When I decided I wanted to go full-time on the podcast,
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.680]   I had no idea what it could turn into,
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.580]   but now we have a newsletter, a membership,
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.740]   we're organizing trips,

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.140]   Next, I talked briefly about credit card benefits before,
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.860]   but specifically, a lot of cards have trip delay
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.820]   and trip cancellation insurance.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.060]   You'll be able to get reimbursed
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.740]   for any non-refundable or prepaid expenses
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.340]   if you have to get canceled for a situation.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.460]   Cancellation is often more for you,
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.860]   like an unpostponable jury duty,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.820]   or a hospitalization, or a major injury.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.040]   Sometimes includes severe weather or named storms.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.840]   Usually doesn't include fog and basic stuff like that.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.900]   It's a pretty common insurance that covers $3,000 to $10,000
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.940]   so that's something worth keeping in mind.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.440]   I think the best insurances I've seen
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   are probably from Chase and Amex,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.240]   but even Capital One has trip cancellation insurance as well.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.120]   When it comes to delays, it's another common coverage,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.940]   which you can be reimbursed for reasonable expenses usually.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.040]   So if you were delayed
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.840]   and you had to spend the night at a hotel
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.000]   that wasn't covered,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.360]   or if you needed to even sometimes buy a meal,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.460]   that can be covered.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.560]   So oftentimes, this is a much smaller coverage,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.280]   so maybe $500 a person,
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.620]   and might require a really meaningful delay,
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.280]   six to 12 hours, not just two hours.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.680]   As for getting compensation,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.160]   if you're trying to get compensation from an airline
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.920]   and you're not having success,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.840]   it's definitely worth filing a complaint
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.500]   with the Department of Transportation.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.680]   That can sometimes get more eyeballs than you think,
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.040]   and it actually counts against the airlines.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.120]   So I think they really try to respond to these
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.080]   if it gets to that,
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.160]   but I've never had to go to that point.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.840]   So hopefully you don't as well.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.400]   And by the way, if you're doing all of these things
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.120]   and if flights are canceled and you need to move around
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.140]   and you've already checked your bag,
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.280]   usually you'll have to go back to the baggage carousel
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.120]   to pick it up and then reload and recheck it on.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.900]   Some airlines might also try to just reroute the bag
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.500]   to your final destination if you're staying on that airline,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.240]   but just keep that in mind during this process.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.320]   It's one of the reasons we used to never love checking bags,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.920]   and then we had children and now it's not really an option,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.100]   so we're checking bags,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.520]   but I'll get to what to do with bags in a little bit.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.080]   I mentioned if you do miss your first flight,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.840]   but what about when you're on a layover?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.800]   So first off, I think it's really important
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.720]   to consider planning for layovers properly.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.320]   I think we used to plan for them differently
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.120]   without children than we do now,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.600]   but I always try to have enough time.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.160]   There's something called a MCT or a minimum connection time
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.920]   where different airports have an amount of time
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.220]   at which they'll let you book a connection,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.240]   but some of those minimum connection times
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.120]   are totally crazy.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.280]   Especially in Europe,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.520]   there are times where I've seen connections
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.120]   that I know are gonna be across a very large airport
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   and it's allowed to book something for 45 minutes.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   I can't remember what the minimum connection time is
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.760]   for Charles de Gaulle in Paris,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.920]   but if I were to book a flight and it said,
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.360]   "Oh, it's okay to book a 50-minute layover in Paris,"
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.300]   I wouldn't book that flight.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.020]   Our au pair is going back to Italy over Thanksgiving,
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.160]   and there are a few options that were bookable
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.740]   with 45 to 60-minute layovers in international airports.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.700]   I just wouldn't book that
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.980]   because it seems like you're putting yourself
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.620]   in a situation where you are likely to have an issue.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.260]   So I try to plan a buffer.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.500]   I also like to just search online
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.020]   for how long it takes to walk between terminals.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.780]   Anyone who's been to a very small airport
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.400]   knows that a 30-minute layover could be fine.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.720]   So sometimes if you do a search online,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.180]   either results on Reddit or TripAdvisor
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.340]   or Flyertalk come up,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.320]   but I'll search LAX, how long to walk
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.400]   from terminal two to terminal seven.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.740]   And you'll usually find someone out there on the internet
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.480]   who has done that or even asked that question before
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.120]   and someone who responded.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.360]   So that's great.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.440]   If you do miss a connection,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.980]   one other important thing is sometimes I will try
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.160]   to save money by booking two separate airlines
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.520]   and connecting them.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.780]   Obviously, if you check bags,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.080]   you're gonna need a lot of extra time
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.880]   to go retrieve your bags and recheck them
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.520]   'cause airlines usually won't connect through.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.140]   Maybe if they're on the same alliance,
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.240]   but often if they're on separate tickets,
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.400]   that's gonna be tricky.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.960]   One important thing to remember in that circumstance
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.840]   is that because you are on separate tickets,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.400]   the second airline isn't just gonna automatically care
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.760]   that the first airline was delayed.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.920]   They're gonna treat you just like you missed your flight,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.360]   got to the airport late and potentially slightly worse
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.040]   for not just booking the entire flight through that airline.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.680]   So I would leave a ton of extra time
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.560]   if you're connecting between two airlines
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.440]   that aren't partners that weren't booked on the same ticket.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.520]   But if you are on all the same airline
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.280]   and you are missing a flight due to a late takeoff
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.920]   or some other mechanical issue,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.280]   the airline is responsible
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.880]   for getting you on the next flight
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.260]   and even offering you accommodation or meal vouchers
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.140]   if you're stuck overnight or at a long period at the airport.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.400]   So keep that in mind.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.760]   Depending on where you're traveling,
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.840]   it might not be required,
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.560]   but it's pretty standard practice.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.760]   So I would just push for it
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.080]   if it's not being voluntarily given to you.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.440]   If you do have to cancel a non-refundable ticket
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.480]   and it ends up happening after the flight is taken off,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.260]   I would try to contact the airline as fast as possible.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.960]   It's very likely you're not gonna get anything back.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.640]   Though sometimes in Europe,
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.280]   if you have a non-refundable ticket
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   and you have to cancel it,
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.960]   you can at least get your taxes back.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.220]   That's not always true in the US,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.860]   but in Europe I've had that situation
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.520]   where it's still worth canceling a non-refundable ticket
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.480]   to at least get your taxes back.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.220]   Debbie wrote in asking for a rule of thumb on layovers.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.880]   My general rule of thumb is at least an hour
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.000]   if I'm very comfortable with the airport
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.360]   and I know how it's laid out
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.000]   and I know I'm not gonna be running between terminals
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.880]   and I'm not traveling for some super sensitive timely thing,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.960]   30, 45 minutes is okay.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.600]   One of the really cool features of a lot of travel apps,
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.280]   but specifically within the Flighty app
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.720]   is that you see the average delay times.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.440]   You can see how frequently this flight gets in early or late.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.500]   And if you're on a kind of route where it's constantly late,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.860]   that might make you feel differently
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.940]   versus I know a lot of times long flights
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.420]   between Japan and the US typically get in a little bit early
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.660]   so you might feel a little better there,
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.820]   but obviously you're gonna have to go through immigration.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.940]   International is a whole different bag,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.340]   especially in other countries with immigration
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.060]   that you're not sure how long it may or may not take.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.280]   The only hacks I have there in the US,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.260]   the US Passport app and Global Entry
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.500]   are great options to speed up time.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.720]   And then if you are eligible for the APEC Business Card
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.160]   because you do business overseas in Asia
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.880]   or any of the APEC region,
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.120]   you can upgrade your Global Entry
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.100]   to have an APEC Business Card
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.520]   and that'll get you expedited immigration,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.040]   basically letting you in the crew lines in APEC countries.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.360]   Now, let's talk about bags a bit more.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.480]   If you do have your bags lost, delayed, damaged,
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.000]   the first thing you're gonna need to do
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   is find the baggage desk of the airline
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.100]   that operated your last flight.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.320]   And that last flight part is important
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.840]   because if you're flying on a ticket
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.640]   that was booked on two passengers,
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.640]   you wanna make sure you,
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.280]   even though your bag might've been lost
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.760]   by the first airline,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.520]   the operating carrier of your last flight
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.200]   is the one who's ultimately responsible
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.620]   for getting the bag to you.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.220]   I don't envy anyone in this situation,
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.100]   but that's who you're gonna wanna talk to.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.320]   You're gonna wanna make sure you file a report
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.200]   before you leave the airport.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.380]   If they tell you they're gonna email you something
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.720]   or ask you to do it later in your hotel,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.240]   don't leave the airport without filing that report.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.760]   For both insurance purposes and tracking purposes,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.400]   it is absolutely something I would want to give them.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.040]   Make sure they have an address for you
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.980]   so they can get your bags to you.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.040]   Airlines generally are pretty good about this.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   When we landed in Hawaii,
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.120]   United didn't get our car seat to us in time.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.440]   We had checked that bag.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.280]   And so a few things I learned there.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.840]   One, they were really great about offering
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.080]   to get the bag delivered to us the next day.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.400]   They even offered if we didn't need the bag
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.600]   to hold it back in San Francisco
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.880]   so that we could just get it when we get home.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.240]   Unfortunately, we had booked a flight from San Francisco
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.400]   and back to Oakland.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.560]   So we needed that car seat to get home
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.360]   when we landed in Oakland to put in a Lyft or an Uber.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.240]   But they ended up delivering it to us the next day.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   They also offered to loan us a car seat.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.060]   It turns out a lot of airlines have loaner car seats
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.280]   for this exact purpose.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.080]   So that's something to keep in mind.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.280]   I didn't know that and had already gone
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.840]   to the rental car counter and had already paid $120
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.040]   to rent two car seats for the week.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.680]   Fortunately, United also took that receipt.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.960]   They didn't reimburse it directly at the airport,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.000]   but I uploaded it online, got a check in the mail,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.120]   and it was totally covered.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.520]   So shout out to United for at least handling that situation
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.440]   as well as they could have outside of the fact
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.360]   that they did not bring the bag.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.560]   So when you do have these situations,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.440]   you are eligible for some kind of compensation.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.480]   Every airline has a different policy.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.940]   United is for expenses based on proof of claim.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.480]   Delta allows reasonable expenses,
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.180]   and they generally say about $50 a day.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.940]   It really depends on the circumstance
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.160]   and what was in your bag and what was necessary.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.680]   I would make an argument that if you had an important meeting
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.280]   and you needed a suit, like renting one or buying one
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.600]   might be a reasonable expense,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.320]   but if you're going on vacation,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.600]   buying a suit probably wouldn't be.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.040]   So I haven't had a lot of experience with lost bags.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.960]   So I don't have a lot of anecdotes here.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.200]   Feel free if you have specific ones to share them
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.000]   so I can let people know, but in general,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.440]   I would definitely try to get some sort of reimbursement
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.920]   for anything that you needed.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.760]   But honestly, the hassle of talking to someone
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.440]   and going through this process,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.320]   if you're just trying to get reimbursement
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.280]   to get reimbursement might not be worth it,
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   though some of these airlines
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.240]   make it really easy to do online.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.720]   When it comes to reimbursement,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.780]   delayed baggage is actually something
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.760]   that is not very common on credit cards.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.680]   I have seen a few chase cards with it, so take a look,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.360]   but it usually requires at least a six hour delay
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.040]   and it's capped at $100.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.800]   So it's not gonna be that big.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.640]   But one really important thing is keeping track of receipts.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.920]   Depending on the airline,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.360]   they may or may not need receipts for a lot of things.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.040]   I can't remember the threshold at United,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.000]   I think it was over 75 or $100 they needed a receipt.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.880]   But if you're going out to buy toothbrushes,
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.640]   toothpaste, deodorant, whatever that is,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.460]   just keep a receipt so you can make sure to get reimbursed.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.940]   If your bags are lost or damaged,
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.840]   that actually is something that is common,
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.080]   credit card benefit.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   So if the airline's not gonna cover that,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.560]   your credit card probably would.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.840]   But I'm not sure actually how hard it will be
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.360]   to prove what was in it and how much it's worth.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.480]   One quick thing, kind of like rental cars
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.680]   that I like to do now is if I'm gonna check a bag,
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.640]   I'll just take a picture of the open bag before I close it,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.800]   just so I can at least have some documentation
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.900]   of what was in there.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.000]   But in general, I'm not putting expensive things in my bag
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.440]   because if it gets lost, at least a bag that's checked,
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.840]   I don't have high expectations
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.640]   that something expensive will be covered.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.280]   As for how to avoid this, well, obvious, don't check bags.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.120]   That's an easy one.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.420]   But for some people, that's not possible.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.360]   What I try to do is keep anything valuable
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.520]   and really important in carry-ons.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.600]   I also try to think about a simple journey.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.920]   So if you're gonna save $50 to take one or two stops,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.760]   keep in mind that there's a chance
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.200]   that that affects the likelihood that you get your bag.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.760]   And I'm sure in that moment, it won't be worth it.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.840]   If you're gonna save thousands of dollars, then absolutely.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.200]   I also put Apple AirTags in all of our bags
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   so that at least I have a good sense of where they are.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.000]   From all the experience of people I know,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.080]   it doesn't actually help get anything resolved
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.120]   other than knowing where things are,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.640]   but there is some peace of mind
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.840]   being able to sit on the plane before it takes off
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.160]   and just say, "Yep, I know my bags are on the plane."
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.840]   And some airlines actually scan at all these intervals
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.120]   and will update the mobile apps with bag is on the plane,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.460]   bag made it here, bag's on the carousel.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.480]   So that's something to keep in mind as well.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.840]   Now, if your travel does go awry,
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.000]   one awesome recommendation from Katya who emailed in
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.800]   said that she has a little hack
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.200]   she's been doing with her daughter.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.720]   And anytime they have a challenge throughout the trip,
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.180]   she pretends with her daughter
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.620]   that they're on an amazing race adventure.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.940]   So for example, she'd experienced a mechanical issue
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.960]   as they were gonna take off
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.680]   and they had to spend a night in a hotel
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.800]   at Heathrow in the UK.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   And so because British Airways didn't make everything clear,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.720]   she kind of made it a game with her daughter.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.840]   And she was like, "Here, we have to get to this hotel.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.760]   "How are we gonna get there?
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.000]   "What's the best way?"
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.720]   And it kind of became a fun event for the family
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.160]   and it was a lot less frustrating.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.940]   So awesome idea.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.440]   Obviously, I hope no one has to use it,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.600]   but if so, might make traveling with kids
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.620]   in these circumstances a little better.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.080]   So let's move on to hotels.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.560]   In general, I think we're not as used to hotel problems,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.160]   but there are a few reasons why a hotel
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.400]   might not end up having your reservation.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.640]   So administrative errors is one,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.280]   which is getting better with confirmations.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.520]   Booking through third parties is another.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.440]   For example, I actually helped someone make a reservation
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.520]   just last week and we called up to confirm something
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.040]   and the hotel didn't have it.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.800]   And we had a confirmation from a third party,
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.480]   but we did not have a reservation confirmation
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.400]   with the hotel.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.360]   So in general, I would say,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.680]   if you're booking on a third party,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.280]   which sometimes can save you a lot of money,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.800]   can get you a lot of perks, is totally worth it,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.560]   you might wanna make sure you call the hotel
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.720]   just to make sure they have your reservation.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.320]   Some hotels intentionally oversell to maximize profit.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.000]   And then sometimes you have guests that just don't check out.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.720]   I know that might sound crazy to some of us,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.080]   but any of those could result in your room
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.400]   not being available.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.840]   And similar to guests overstaying,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.400]   I guess you could also have health,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.280]   cleanliness, mechanical issues.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.900]   So if a room was no longer able to be used,
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.940]   maybe they didn't oversell the hotel,
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.900]   but now the hotel has less capacity
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.960]   because one room's out of service.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   So unlike airlines where there are really clear rules
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.380]   about what happens and what rights people have,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.160]   there's no government regulations in this area.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.320]   You're almost always gonna be able to get a refund
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.200]   if a hotel can't honor your reservation,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.360]   but I would be pushing a lot harder
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.480]   for compensation in that circumstance.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.080]   And I would certainly be asking them to book me
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.920]   in a comparable or better hotel nearby.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.560]   And I would be pushing the front desk, the manager, the GM,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.160]   or worst case, calling the hotel loyalty program,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.640]   someone in central reservations at Marriott or Hyatt
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.000]   to see what can be done.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.520]   If your room class isn't available
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.460]   and all they have is suites,
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.840]   I wouldn't expect to pay any extra for that.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.560]   So keep all of those things in mind.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.640]   Every hotel chain has some rules published
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.880]   about what they will do,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.840]   some of them more clear than others.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.000]   But in general, I've found that most hotel chains
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.320]   that you work with will probably find some way
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.480]   to take care of you, but it's up to you to push for it
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.420]   and make sure that you get something reasonable.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.080]   As for how to avoid this,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.440]   when hotels have to decide how to walk guests,
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.640]   there are a few criteria I know they look at.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.160]   People who have booked through a third party,
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.200]   who aren't part of their loyalty program,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.720]   who have never stayed before,
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.900]   who are only staying for one night,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.800]   or who have really, really, really discounted rates
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.320]   are often reasons that you could be chosen
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.700]   for someone who's walked.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.480]   So I think the easiest way to solve that
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   is to just make sure
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.360]   that you join all the hotel loyalty programs
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.600]   and add a number to your reservation.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.720]   That one is one where I think it's going to have
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.520]   a huge impact for a very little cost.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.120]   In addition to that, calling ahead, confirming your room,
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.860]   even calling early in the morning
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.920]   and getting a room assigned if you're really, really worried
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.600]   could be something that could help.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.880]   Some hotels allow you to check in online,
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.080]   you could check in early, or you could just book direct.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.940]   I think booking direct is always gonna give you
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.120]   a little edge here, but at the end of the day,
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.300]   if you can save 30, 40% booking elsewhere,
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.440]   I think that could be worth it.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.180]   Just know that in these rare circumstances,
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.000]   you might not be on the same playing field
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.600]   as someone who booked direct.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.720]   Last on hotels is just when things go wrong in the hotel.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.520]   If you check into your room, something's not working,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.360]   there's a weird smell,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.240]   I've had a couple of situations like this.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.720]   In that circumstance, I wouldn't try to wait it out.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.800]   I would just immediately call down and say,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.160]   this is what's wrong with the room,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.940]   can you get me in something else?
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.920]   Oftentimes that something else will be a little bit nicer,
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.380]   or you'll get some bonus points, or some free drinks,
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.580]   or something like that.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.380]   I don't try to use this to my advantage.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.100]   I'm not looking for problems in a room
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.420]   when I'm going into them.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.860]   But when we were staying in Bora Bora,
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.300]   the air conditioner wasn't working.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.220]   And so that was certainly a reason to ask for a new room.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.820]   And we tried calling to get it fixed.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.900]   It was late, we were trying to go to bed, someone came,
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.180]   they said they fixed it.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.780]   And if it didn't work in 30 minutes to call back,
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.420]   we called back in 30 minutes, it wasn't fixed,
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.580]   no one answered.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.480]   And so we actually ended up staying in the room.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.760]   And the next morning, I went to the front desk and said,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.160]   hey, our room's air conditioner isn't working,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   can we get a new room?
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.740]   They were great, they put us in a new room.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.320]   And I asked them, I didn't demand it necessarily,
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.040]   but I said, hey, given that last night,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.940]   the air conditioner wasn't working all night,
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.400]   do we need to pay for that night?
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   And they said, no, no, no,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.100]   we'll take that night off your bill, which was awesome.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.760]   I wasn't gonna put up a fight if they said no,
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.960]   but it never hurts to ask.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.680]   If my voice sounds a little different right now,
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.840]   it's 'cause I'm recording this
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.720]   after I recorded the whole episode.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.460]   But on the topic of hotels,
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.140]   I wanted to share something I've been working on
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.320]   for a while.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.160]   If you've listened,
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.440]   you know that we have a luxury upgrade program
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.480]   that can give you access
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.040]   to some really awesome exclusive benefits
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.120]   at about 4,000 luxury hotels around the world.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.200]   Think five-star hotels like Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.600]   Ondas, St. Regis, Ritz-Carlton, that kind of stuff,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.220]   as well as some boutique hotels.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.720]   And you usually get daily breakfast for two,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.640]   a $100 property credit, free wifi,
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.000]   and a free upgrade if it's available,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.760]   and early and late checkout if those are available.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.840]   And so the way this had worked before
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.160]   is you have to send an email
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.840]   and include all this information,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.760]   and we try to help you out with it.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.260]   Well, I'm really excited that we finally built a site
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.440]   where you can do all of this on your own.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.960]   So if you go to hotels.allthehacks.com,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.840]   you can actually do a search yourself
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.760]   for these exclusive deals and perks and benefits.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.680]   You can either search by property or search by city,
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.000]   and when the results come up,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.760]   just make sure to click View Details,
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.440]   and you'll get a list of all the rooms,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.960]   and you'll see whether they have
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.400]   all the Hacks Preferred rates or Virtuoso amenities.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.340]   And when you click View Full Description,
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.800]   you'll get all the details.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.440]   So for example, I just quickly searched for London,
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.920]   and the first hotel that pulled up
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.720]   was the Great Scotland Yard, which is a Hyatt hotel,
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   and it says one king bedroom, highlights,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.620]   Hyatt Privé breakfast for two, welcome amenity,
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.920]   $100 property credit, early check-in,
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.880]   late check-out, room upgrade.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.640]   So hopefully this is an awesome tool
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.480]   for anyone looking to book a luxury hotel
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.160]   and get some extra perks.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.780]   The rates are not gonna be any different
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.440]   than you would find for a standard rate on the website,
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.440]   but you are gonna get some benefits.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.880]   If you've already gotten perks like this
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.440]   through a program like Amex's Fine Hotels and Resorts,
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.200]   or what Chase and Capital One have offered,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.360]   you'll be familiar.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.200]   The only difference here is I'm pretty sure
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.080]   we have about 4,000 hotels,
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.840]   and each of those programs has anywhere
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.760]   from 300 or 400 to I think Amex has a little over 2,000.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.680]   So we have a bit of a broader set,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.200]   and from what I've been told
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.600]   from the travel partner we're working with,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.200]   that because all these reservations
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.480]   are actually getting routed through a boutique travel agency,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.800]   you'll probably have slightly better preference
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.640]   or priority over the reservations
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.680]   going through a bigger platform like Amex or Chase.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.060]   That said, find the best deals you can,
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.140]   but I just wanted to let you know
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.240]   that we made this site available to everyone,
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   and hopefully it can hook you up on a future trip.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.280]   All right, let's move on from hotels.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.480]   There is nothing like watching your kids grow up so fast
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.560]   to make you realize that you're not getting
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.840]   any younger either.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.960]   So if you're like me,
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.520]   and the number of birthday candles keeps going up,
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.920]   and you don't have a life insurance policy yet,
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.480]   then check out our sponsor today, Fabric.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.340]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.360]   to help you get a high quality, surprisingly affordable
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.600]   term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.680]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.840]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.360]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.160]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.040]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.320]   And you could go from start to covered
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.280]   in less than 10 minutes with no health exam required.

[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.960]   but the reality is I'm not.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.160]   But if you're a longtime listener,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.600]   you might know I've been drinking AG-1 for about two years.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.480]   When I started drinking AG-1 daily,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.240]   it was to help with daily nutrition,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.280]   but I also felt a real difference
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.440]   in the energy I had every day.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.680]   So it's been in my routine ever since.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.080]   And that's because AG-1
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.360]   is a foundational nutrition supplement
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.760]   that supports your body's universal needs
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.440]   like gut optimization, stress management, and immune support.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.680]   Since 2010, AG-1 has led
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.840]   the future of foundational nutrition,
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.960]   continuously refining their formula
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.680]   to create a smarter, better way
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.000]   to elevate your baseline health.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.360]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.080]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.120]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.760]   and energized for the day,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.280]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.920]   I also love that AG-1 is raising the standard
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.120]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.040]   with less than one gram of sugar
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.760]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   It's just another reason I'm excited
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.120]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.880]   If you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.680]   it starts with AG-1.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.400]   Try AG-1 and get a free one-year supply
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.640]   of vitamin D3K2 and five free AG-1 travel packs

[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.160]   All right, moving on to car rentals.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.180]   We did a really deep dive episode
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.800]   with Jonathan Weinberg from Auto Slash in episode 66.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.160]   So if you wanna go deep on car rentals, check that out.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.840]   But a few tips here.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.720]   One, a lot of rental car reservations
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.100]   require no upfront payment
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.840]   and there's no cancellation fees.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.400]   So if you're really worried
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.880]   that your car might not be available,
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.000]   you're welcome to book a backup.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.880]   Some rental car companies might look at a backup
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.200]   under the same name at the same place negatively.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.720]   So you could book it in a spouse's name
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.280]   or book it at two companies.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.920]   Two companies might be a little bit safer
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.860]   because if a rental car company
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.400]   just doesn't have a car for you,
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.160]   then it doesn't matter if you have one reservation or two.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.240]   There are some policies that seem like
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.720]   they might be changing,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.940]   not necessarily to not give you
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.060]   that flexibility of booking backups,
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.380]   but saying if you don't cancel
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.760]   before you're supposed to pick it up,
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.840]   you might get charged a fee.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.740]   So definitely keep an eye on those rules
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.740]   as they might evolve.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.380]   And by the way, that's exactly why
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.020]   I think some of these can be problems
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.220]   with so many people being able
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.760]   to book car rental reservations
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.460]   and no penalties for not canceling them.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.100]   It's really hard for rental car companies
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.460]   to manage inventory.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.240]   So they're obviously gonna be overselling
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.300]   and when everyone picks their car up,
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.340]   they're gonna have an issue
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.620]   and you're not gonna have a car.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.260]   So in that circumstance,
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.180]   if a car rental runs out of cars,
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.980]   absolutely, if they offer you an upgrade to a next class,
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.220]   make sure that you're not paying for it.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.500]   If they say we don't have your class,
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.460]   but we can put you here,
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.020]   that is an immediate, I would be happy to upgrade,
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.980]   but I would like to have that upgrade for free.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.900]   It's pretty standard industry practice
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.720]   to go book you into a car from a competitor.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.140]   So if they don't have a rental car,
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.340]   I would ask for that and I would push for it.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.040]   If you have to take a cab or go farther
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.140]   to get to your other rental car,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.780]   I would expect that rental car company
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.340]   to cover that as well.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.900]   If you're looking in advance and you just don't see cars
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.900]   because you didn't book early enough,
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.300]   a few options here.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.520]   One is to widen your search.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.340]   Don't just look at airports.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.260]   A lot of times the airports are sold out,
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.900]   but for example, in Park City one year,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.560]   we just couldn't get an SUV for the family at the airport.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.740]   They were all sold out,
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.740]   but we looked in downtown Salt Lake City
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.120]   and there were plenty of cars.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.920]   So actually, as soon as we landed,
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.380]   one of us took a lift over
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.300]   while everyone collected bags and all that stuff
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.960]   and then we came back and picked everyone else up.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.100]   So that was a good option if you have a lot of stuff.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.000]   If you don't have a lot of stuff,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.340]   you could just all head there.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.620]   But looking at those neighborhood branches can help.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.700]   If you do have elite status with rental car companies,
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.260]   which a lot of credit cards,
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.740]   the Venturex, the Amex Platinum, include some coverage,
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.100]   some of them actually include coverage
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.100]   that guarantees you a rental car.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.140]   So even though you might look online and see it sold out,
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.280]   you might be able to call up
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.600]   and guarantee yourself a reservation.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.620]   So that's one.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.700]   And then in general,
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.440]   just when it comes to things going wrong,
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.620]   if you rent a car,
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.300]   I would absolutely make sure
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.500]   that you either are insured through their program
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.020]   or use a card that includes insurance.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.360]   I go a little bit deeper in this
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.320]   in the insurance and rental car episodes,
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.780]   but primary rental car coverage is awesome.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.620]   There are a lot of cards that cover it.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.080]   I highly recommend using that
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.100]   to save having to pay for the collision coverage
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.240]   from the rental car company,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.100]   which is usually a lot more expensive.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.860]   But if you don't have a car insurance policy
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.740]   for your own vehicles,
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.180]   then you'll wanna make sure you have liability coverage
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.220]   because that is not covered by credit cards
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.700]   that offer rental car coverage.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.120]   They're only covering damage to the vehicle.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.340]   They're not covering your liability
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.940]   if you get an accident and cause damage to someone else.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.040]   So a few things you can do in advance,
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.460]   confirm your reservation,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.300]   make sure that you have everything written down.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.860]   If you're worried about your phone dying, print it out,
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.080]   arrive on time, checking in as early as possible.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.420]   You don't wanna give them any reason
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.200]   to think you're not gonna pick up your car.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.760]   So if your flight's late,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   you could call and let them know you're running late
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.000]   and then have a plan B.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.180]   So always be thinking about what's an option.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.080]   Do you wanna back up?
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:38.960]   Is there a cab?
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.880]   How is that gonna work?
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.600]   So it really depends on the type of trip you're taking
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.840]   and how necessary it is and how mission critical this is
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.600]   and how sold out they are.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.280]   If you look for cars a couple of days before your trip
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.980]   and they're all super cheap, then it's not a problem.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.580]   If a couple of days before your trip,
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.360]   you do a quick search for cars
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.060]   at the airport you're going to
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.420]   and it's completely sold out everywhere
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.620]   or they're all hundreds and hundreds of dollars a day,
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.940]   that might be a circumstance
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.960]   where I'd be thinking about backup options
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.040]   or I'd be thinking about calling ahead
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.900]   just to try to make sure I have something.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   And finally, two tips here.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.180]   When you do rent a rental car,
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.280]   I would always make sure you take pictures and walk around.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.640]   And if you notice any damage,
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.740]   make sure to flag it before you leave.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.660]   When we were in Hawaii,
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.900]   the rental car had a bunch of dents in it.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.540]   And so I just made sure that we stopped
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.980]   before we left the lot,
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.240]   right at that gate where you're about to roll over
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.740]   those crazy spikes.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.980]   And they brought out a piece of paper.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.040]   We marked all the dents.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:34.980]   I took pictures of them.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.100]   We drove off.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.580]   The last thing you wanna do is return a car
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.780]   and then have to get into an argument
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.340]   about whether you caused damage or it was already there.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.180]   And then especially if you're in a foreign country
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.220]   and you get in an accident,
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.020]   always try to get a police report.
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.340]   Some countries that's very, very necessary
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.620]   to get anything covered.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.900]   Not usually in the US, but overseas it can very much matter.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.060]   So that's something that I would do
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.060]   if you were getting in a car accident with a rental car.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.060]   So that's the main stuff.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.140]   Let's talk about a few other ways things can go awry.
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.140]   Getting lost.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.220]   One of my tips here is Google Maps has offline maps.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.340]   So get that all figured out in advance.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.460]   Download all those maps.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.960]   That way, whether you even are traveling
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.180]   with data on your phone,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.740]   you'll be able to find your way around a city.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.400]   And then last, if you're abroad and something happens,
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.660]   one of the places that can be your best friend
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.540]   is the local embassy for your country.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.980]   So I can't remember the name of the listener
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.180]   who shared a story that I mentioned earlier,
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.340]   but they had a problem and they worked with their embassy
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.800]   and they were able to get a lot of support,
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.780]   getting things resolved,
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.060]   helping find the right departments within the country
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.980]   to talk about.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.580]   That's just something that I think they're there
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.820]   to help you when you're traveling if something goes wrong.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.920]   So that's something that I would keep in mind.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.460]   As for holiday travel, general tips,
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.680]   book things in advance.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.060]   One thing that I don't always think about
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.620]   booking in advance is airport parking,
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.340]   but there are both two reasons to do it.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.620]   Sometimes you can save money.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.580]   I know I got an email from the Oakland airport
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.540]   saying book it in advance and save some money.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.460]   So that's cool.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.840]   But also you can sometimes guarantee a spot.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.020]   Getting to the airport a little extra early.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.740]   When we went to Hawaii,
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.740]   I saw the longest lines we have ever seen for security.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.580]   It blew my mind.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.860]   Even with pre and clear and some basic status on United,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.620]   it was at least 45 minutes to go
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.660]   from getting dropped off at SFO through security,
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.800]   which was absolutely crazy.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.320]   What we ended up doing,
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.860]   which certainly saved us time
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.620]   because we actually tracked the people
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.400]   that were getting in line at the same time as us.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.800]   And this doesn't always work at every airport,
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.140]   but you can go through any security.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.580]   So at SFO, for example,
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.340]   terminal three is the domestic terminal for United,
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.380]   but it's connected to the international terminal,
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.300]   specifically the G gates.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.580]   And so we saw these ridiculously long lines.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.220]   There must've been at least 50 to 75 people
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.380]   just in the clear line for TSA pre-check plus clear.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.540]   So we actually walked from terminal three
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.980]   to the international terminal
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.120]   where the line was two people,
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.340]   went through security
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.200]   and then just walked back over to terminal three.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.740]   I'm a hundred percent sure we saved time doing that.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.260]   If we didn't check bags,
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.260]   we actually would have made it through a lot faster,
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.100]   but the line just to be able to drop your bags,
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.140]   even if you tagged them yourself was so long.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.280]   So going forward with kids and checking bags,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.740]   I unfortunately think gone are the days
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.400]   of getting to the airport last minute.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.580]   When it's just me, I'm traveling solo.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.280]   I don't have any bags to check.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.680]   Sure, I might show up 45 minutes before the flight,
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.060]   but around the holidays with family, check bags,
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.480]   that you just can't do that anymore.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.060]   So definitely consider pre-check and clear
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.540]   for your next trip.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.480]   You don't need to enroll your children,
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.100]   I believe under a certain age.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.260]   Definitely consider that.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.900]   If you get global entry, you get free pre-check,
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.540]   but if you're not gonna be traveling internationally,
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.460]   I have heard that the wait times to get your appointments
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.700]   and everything for global entry
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.700]   can be a lot longer than pre-check.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.620]   So you could just go pre-check.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.660]   However, there are two tips
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   for getting global entry appointments faster.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.640]   One is you could just do it on demand.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.420]   So if you get global entry,
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.940]   your next time you're coming back
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.260]   from an international trip,
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.180]   you could just go do your appointment there.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.980]   And then two is appointmentscanner.com
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.020]   is an amazing website that'll monitor
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.220]   your local global entry appointment center
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.820]   and send you an email as soon as there's an appointment.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.180]   I've been able to get appointments
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.420]   within a few days using that tactic in the past.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.140]   Those two things will certainly help
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.220]   get you through airport security in advance
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.320]   on your next trip if you don't already have them.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.940]   So that makes up a lot of the when travel goes awry,
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.340]   but there is a bunch of other stuff
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.380]   I wanted to cover in this episode.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.340]   So let's jump through it quickly.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.020]   First off, two awesome wins.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.660]   One from a listener who's asked not to share their name,
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.980]   but in the 18 months
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.280]   since they started seriously playing this game,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.620]   they have now booked over $115,000 worth of travel
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.820]   with some points left for other things.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.260]   I'm so glad this podcast has helped you save that much.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.740]   Obviously, you might not have spent that much on your own,
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.060]   but it's awesome to see what you've been able to do.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.140]   Finally, awesome email from a family of four
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.340]   that was able to do a trip to LA, Tokyo, Singapore,
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.860]   and Bali, they have two young boys,
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.620]   and they were able to do it all
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   with a bunch of deals and hacks using points,
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.020]   using discounts, using perks from the upgrade program.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.140]   If you're not familiar there,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.660]   allthehacks.com/upgrade will allow you to book travel
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.260]   and get perks like free breakfast,
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.140]   property credits, and whatnot
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.220]   for over 4,000 hotels worldwide.
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.680]   They ended up saving over $15,000 on that trip.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.780]   So awesome, awesome, awesome to hear that story.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.540]   It makes me so, so happy.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.020]   They ended up doing that whole two-week trip
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.300]   for only $3,500.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.500]   They priced it out otherwise,
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.220]   and it would have been $18,500.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.140]   Next, I wanna share a mix of deals, travel stuff,
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.620]   and a few awesome tips.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.580]   The first is an awesome bonus for new cardholders
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.180]   for the Chase Freedom Unlimited card,
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.540]   and that is that you get double cash back,
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.060]   which is actually the same as double points
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.940]   for your entire first year.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.820]   And they say there's no limit to how much you get.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.980]   So this card typically gets one and a half points
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.940]   on everything, three points on drugstores,
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.020]   three points on dining,
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.740]   and five points on travel through their portal,
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.980]   which means you're actually gonna get 2X
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.180]   all of those numbers, which is really, really crazy.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.540]   The downside is there's not a big welcome bonus,
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.180]   but being able to get 3% on everything,
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.540]   6% on restaurants and drugstores
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:34.180]   is a huge, huge, awesome deal all at no annual fee.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.900]   It's only for one year,
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.260]   but I think if you are spending a lot
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.420]   and are looking for just an everyday workhorse card
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.580]   that you can use, being able to get 6X on restaurants
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.020]   and 3X everywhere else is really unheard of.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.660]   The other really cool thing is that for the first 15 months,
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.500]   there's 0% intro APR.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.740]   I never really thought about it from this perspective
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.700]   until someone reached out to me and proposed this,
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.580]   which I will share probably in more detail in the future.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.860]   But if you wanna think about the benefit
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.580]   of not having to pay off your card in full each month
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.340]   for 15 months, taking all the money
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.300]   you would have otherwise paid it off for
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.300]   and putting it in treasuries
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.780]   or even a high-yield savings account,
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.140]   earning an effective 5% or more,
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.220]   that could be a meaningful amount of money too.
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.020]   While it doesn't have an intro bonus,
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:25.260]   if there's a card that let's say you put $2,000 a month on,
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.220]   you can only make minimum payments,
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.500]   let's say that allows you to carry a balance of $20,000
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.220]   for on average, let's say seven or eight months.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:39.220]   Well, that $20,000 at 5% for seven months is over $500.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:45.180]   So pretty cool little hack for playing the 0% APR game
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.500]   as a way to take your money, invest it and earn a return
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.060]   that potentially, this is where I wanna go deeper
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.500]   in a future episode, could rival the points you earn.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.220]   But in the case of the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.020]   you're getting the points and getting the ability
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.940]   to invest your money instead of pay off your bill.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.740]   So really great win for a card
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.100]   that doesn't have a welcome bonus or an annual fee.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.980]   And in general, if you're playing the Chase ecosystem,
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.700]   the way this card works is it's marketed
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.100]   as a cashback card, but it earns ultimate rewards points.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.700]   And if you have a Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.420]   or Sapphire Reserve or an Inc Business Unlimited,
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.100]   you can transfer all your ultimate rewards points
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.500]   to airline partners, including the ones you earn
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.140]   with the Freedom Unlimited card.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.340]   So all the links to all the cards
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:33.700]   that I'm gonna talk about are at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.940]   Signing up with those links does support the show.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.780]   So I appreciate you going there.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.180]   For the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.900]   this deal doesn't show up at first on that page,
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.980]   but I promise you, if you click through enough,
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.060]   learn more and get started buttons,
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.460]   you will land on a page that has that bonus listed.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.220]   So that's one cool card.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.980]   When it comes to transfer bonuses,
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.140]   there are a couple right now.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.980]   On the Amex side, you're getting 25% bonus
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:01.660]   going to JetBlue, 20% to Marriott, and 30% to Hilton.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.340]   None of those are exciting enough
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.820]   to get me to want to make a transfer,
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.860]   but if you have something in mind
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.860]   or you need just a few more points
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.340]   to be able to get to the threshold
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.740]   to book a hotel or a flight, it could make sense.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.780]   On the Chase side, you get 25% bonus
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.740]   to Air France KLM's Flying Blue program.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.860]   That's only through the end of November,
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.780]   but I'm really interested in that
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.060]   because Air France and KLM Flying Blue
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.660]   also just confirmed that they're gonna change
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.940]   their pricing model for award flights,
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.460]   and those changes are gonna result
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:38.460]   in needing 66 to 71% fewer miles than you needed before.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.460]   So I'll post an article in the show notes
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.140]   if you wanna read more about that,
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.900]   but really cool combo here, transferring to Air France KLM,
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.340]   getting bonus points, and then needing less points
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.300]   to book your flight.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.060]   Along the lines of airline program changes,
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.580]   anyone that's a Delta flyer probably already knows this,
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.180]   but Delta made a bunch of changes to the negative,
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.980]   then walked back those changes,
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.540]   and in some ways walked them back so far
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.740]   that the new ability to earn status from credit cards
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.540]   is even better than it was before.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.260]   So there are a lot of changes.
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.500]   I won't go into all those details here
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.900]   because if you're a Delta flyer,
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.420]   you've probably already read about them.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.860]   I will link to a couple articles in the show notes,
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.620]   but I will say one interesting thing
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.140]   is that if you were to get two Delta cards,
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.660]   you'd be able to get Delta silver status easily next year.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.420]   And if you were to get all four Delta platinum reserve,
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.260]   business, and personal cards,
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.660]   you'd actually get Delta gold status from those four cards.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.540]   So that's something to keep in mind as well.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.940]   If you really want Delta status,
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.060]   but you're not gonna fly them,
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.500]   though I will say silver status on Delta
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.260]   is not gonna get you a whole lot more
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.780]   than free check bags,
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.300]   which you can get with one credit card anyways.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.180]   Speaking of which, the Delta platinum card
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.940]   and the platinum business card
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.260]   is something that right now,
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.220]   I never thought I would say
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.460]   'cause we don't fly Delta that much,
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.140]   but it's something that's probably on my list
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.500]   for my next few cards to sign up for,
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.300]   primarily because we have a Delta trip next year.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.220]   The free check bags is valuable.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.140]   The platinum companion certificate is pretty interesting.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.060]   You get one companion flight,
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:17.220]   and then you also get 15% off all of your award trips.
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.960]   So I factored in how many miles I have,
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.180]   what that 15% would be worth.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.020]   It's probably gonna save us
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.820]   close to 200 bucks in check bags as well.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.740]   Plus, depending on the bonus that you are targeted for,
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.100]   you could be looking at anywhere from 50 to 100,000 points.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.820]   So I have links for those.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.880]   There is also a website that I will link to
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.220]   that you might find a better bonus for.
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.760]   But all in all, I think that card
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.920]   is actually pretty decent
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.900]   if you're gonna be traveling for Delta enough,
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.080]   but not enough to meet status.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.960]   There are also a bunch of changes to the Amex Hilton lineup.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.540]   And so with really no notice,
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:55.740]   they made changes to the Aspire and to the Surpass card.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.220]   The Aspire is actually one of my favorite cards
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.340]   because the benefits from the card
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.660]   have historically really outweighed the annual fee.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.660]   That said, the annual fee is going up.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.920]   There's still a great welcome bonus,
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.500]   but the annual fee went up from 450 to 550.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.820]   And how it's gonna work now
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.780]   is you're gonna get a $200 resort credit
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.220]   at Hilton twice a year.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.080]   You're gonna get a $200 flight credit, but $50 a quarter.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.720]   However, in the past,
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.840]   these Amex flight credits have only worked on fees
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.240]   and these are gonna work on any airline purchase.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.800]   I just used our Hilton Aspire to buy,
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.120]   I think $50 of United Travel Bank credit
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.160]   and that triggered the credit.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.280]   So that was great.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.480]   You're also gonna get a free night with the card
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.920]   and then another one at $30,000 a spend
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.640]   and another one at $60,000.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   And that's a free night at all Hilton properties
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.460]   at their standard rates.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.300]   And then finally,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.340]   you're gonna get an annual reimbursement of Clear.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.120]   So if you're interested in Clear status,
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.880]   this could kind of combine with that.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.040]   And you also get national executive status for rental cars.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.820]   So it's still becoming a bit of a coupon book
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.060]   to put piece together.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.940]   But if you stay at a couple Hiltons a year,
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:05.020]   it would be hard for me to imagine
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.780]   you don't get value from this card.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.220]   And the biggest perk I forgot to mention,
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.860]   you also get Hilton Diamond status,
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.460]   which is their top tier of status.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.000]   You won't see this card on allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.040]   We don't have any partner links for this card,
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.840]   but my wife's referral link
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.920]   is at allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.260]   So if you're gonna check it out,
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.100]   you can check it out there.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.840]   And right now I think the bonus is 180,000 Hilton points,
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.300]   which is pretty cool.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.720]   On the surpass card,
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.600]   annual fee went up from 95 to 150.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.940]   You now get $50 of Hilton credits each quarter.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.760]   So you're gonna need to be staying at Hilton's a lot
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.040]   for that to work.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.480]   And you lose lounge access,
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.940]   but get national executive status.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.180]   So I still think that if you're gonna be staying
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.020]   at Hilton enough,
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.900]   you'll get more value out of the Aspire,
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.320]   getting the free night and the other credits.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.200]   But just figured I'd share some of those changes.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.700]   Coming back briefly to the airline conversation,
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.520]   Southwest has made it a little bit easier
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.860]   to get A-list and A-list preferred,
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.780]   which are their two elite statuses,
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.980]   which have a few better perks like upgrades
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.220]   and free drinks.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.420]   But the big status that everyone's targeting
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.340]   on Southwest is companion pass.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.560]   And towards the end of the year becomes
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.020]   what I'll call companion pass season.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.000]   And that way it works.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.140]   And I'll probably link to an article in the show notes
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.040]   'cause I've talked about this a few times,
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.620]   but very high level.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.300]   If you get 135,000 rapid rewards points,
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.660]   you're able to get a companion pass with Southwest.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.780]   You get it the year you qualify and the following year,
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.980]   and you can nominate one person.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.500]   You can change it up to three times a year,
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.920]   but in that person will fly free for you except for taxes.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.840]   And so the reason why it's so popular to talk about now
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.020]   is that if you were to get two Southwest credit cards
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:52.580]   and wait until January 1st to complete the minimum spend
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.420]   and earn your welcome bonuses,
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.340]   those welcome bonuses will post in January
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.280]   or maybe February, you'll earn your companion pass
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.340]   and you'll get it for the entirety of 2024 and 2025.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.800]   And right now all three Chase consumer cards
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.380]   are offering a 75,000 point welcome bonus.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.460]   The business cards are at 60 and 80,000 points.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.780]   So if you have a business,
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.980]   you can get one personal, one business.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.660]   I've done this in the past.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.400]   That'll quickly get you well past your threshold.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.320]   And not only do you get companion pass,
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.960]   but you will have all of those points
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.180]   from those signup bonuses to be able to use on Southwest.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.060]   And companion pass works on points reservations.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:35.180]   So those two welcome bonuses will get you
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:39.080]   probably close to $2,000 of Southwest credit
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.420]   in the form of points.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.060]   Southwest program is pretty fixed.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.540]   So you get about 1.4 cents per point, no more, no less,
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.460]   within a range sometimes maybe 1.1 to 1.5,
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.500]   but you're never gonna get outsized value.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.180]   So that could be a way to travel almost for free
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.180]   for two years with two signup bonuses,
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:57.980]   which is something that in the past
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:59.920]   we've definitely taken advantage of.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.460]   I'll link to a full guide to Southwest companion pass
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:05.020]   from the Frequent Miler blog, which is really good.
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.780]   And last for Southwest people,
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.340]   there's a hack I wanted to share,
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:11.820]   which is Southwest lowest tier of ticket,
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.860]   the wanna get away fares.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.760]   The one downside to them is that if you cancel your flight,
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.000]   that credit you have is only eligible to be used by you.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.920]   You can't transfer it to anyone else.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:26.420]   However, the trick here is you can use that credit
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:31.100]   to buy yourself a ticket on a wanna get away plus fare,
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.620]   and then cancel the wanna get away plus fare
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.300]   and get transferable credit.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.820]   So that's been really handy
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.300]   for a couple of situations for us this year.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.660]   Last, there's one more card that's on my radar
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.260]   for the rest of this year or next year.
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.340]   And I've talked about it a lot.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.700]   It's the built card.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.860]   And if I paid rent, I would absolutely have the card.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.180]   It's the only card out there that earns points on rent.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.660]   I think you're gonna earn up to 100,000 points a year.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.980]   You earn one X point per dollar on rent.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.520]   You also get three points on travel
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.060]   and two points on dining.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.220]   Not too different from Chase Sapphire preferred reserve.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.620]   So might not help you there.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.540]   But a couple of things that Built's been doing
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.700]   that makes me just really want Built points
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.780]   is they have a stellar lineup of transfer partners.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.500]   In addition to a lot of the common ones
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.160]   that everyone has, British Airways, Air France, Air Canada,
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.940]   they also have United, which only Chase has.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.880]   American, which they're the only card
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.900]   that has American as a transfer partner,
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.900]   which is a really big standout perk.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.100]   And then they have Hyatt, and they just added Marriott.
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.300]   With Marriott, you get the one-to-one transfer,
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.540]   which I don't think is necessarily that compelling.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:36.420]   But if you do transfer in batches of 20,000 points,
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.060]   you get an extra 5,000 points.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.560]   So it's one to 1.25.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.380]   You do get 100 points for linking your Marriott account
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.900]   as well as all your other accounts.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.260]   So even if you don't have the Built card,
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:51.300]   I think it's worth signing up for a Built Rewards account.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.600]   Every first of the month, they have rent day,
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.420]   and they have games, and you can earn points.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.980]   And while it might only be 100, 200, 300 here or there,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.540]   over time, they add up.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.500]   And if you ever do get the Built card,
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.100]   you can start stacking those.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:08.700]   Also on rent day, they've had some crazy, crazy promotions
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.900]   that are really the reason why I'm thinking
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.380]   I need more Built points.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.460]   In addition to doubling all your points,
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.180]   meaning you're getting 6x on dining, 4x on travel,
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.740]   and 2x on everything else,
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.720]   they've been offering some transfer bonuses
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.640]   that are unbelievable.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.100]   So they've had ones where not just your standard 25,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.060]   30% transfer bonus, but they've recently had transfer bonuses
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:35.060]   as high as 175% bonus, meaning one point to 2.75.
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.740]   They did a 100% transfer bonus to Air France,
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.340]   which I wish I had the Built points to do.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.100]   So those are all really awesome.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.220]   And then last, one really cool perk
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.100]   of just being a Built Rewards member, which is totally free,
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.520]   is that using the Built Rewards travel search,
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.120]   you can actually search for flights and hotels
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.260]   using Point.me and Aways free of charge.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.700]   So instead of needing to buy a Point.me account,
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.860]   you can use it through the Built app.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.740]   It is only limited to Built's transfer partners,
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.220]   but you get it for free.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.020]   The same thing is also true for Aways,
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.620]   which is an awesome award hotel search site.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.740]   And now that Built has Hyatt, IHG, and Marriott,
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.760]   you can search all three of those on Aways
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.380]   for free through Built.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.820]   So overall, everyone should just go get a Built account
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.220]   for free searching tools and some extra points.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.420]   But if you wanna start earning more Built points seriously,
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.680]   I would obviously love it if you wanna use my referral link,
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.940]   which is allthehacks.com/built, B-I-L-T.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.940]   And I'd encourage you, once you sign up,
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.700]   to share with your friends.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.820]   Okay, last I'm gonna run through five quick things
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.280]   with the one that's gonna save me the most at the end,
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.460]   which is really awesome.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.760]   So first, I never knew this,
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.380]   but Odessa emailed in to let me know
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.660]   that a lot of local libraries have museum passes.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.180]   And so sure enough, I looked up our local library
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.180]   and they have a partnership
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.520]   with a program called Discover & Go
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.580]   that has free passes you can check out and borrow virtually
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.180]   to really great museums.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.200]   So California Academy of Sciences,
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.860]   SFX, the San Francisco Exploratorium.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.760]   So definitely make sure you go look
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.380]   at whether you can get access
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.020]   to local museums from your library.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.500]   If you have an Amex Platinum right now,
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.200]   you might've known that you get access
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.920]   to Walmart Plus for free.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.380]   We don't really ever shop at Walmart,
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.820]   so I never really activated it,
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.120]   but Walmart Plus has a partnership with Paramount Plus
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.920]   so that with a Walmart Plus membership,
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.500]   you get Paramount Plus free.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.240]   So if you do have an Amex Platinum,
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.880]   you can go through that double link
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.400]   and get free Paramount Plus, which is interesting.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.380]   They are not a partner of the digital entertainment credit
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.820]   that Amex provides.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.660]   But I will say if you do have an Amex Platinum
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.880]   and you are using your digital entertainment credit,
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.780]   which gets you $20 a month on New York Times,
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.740]   SiriusXM, Wall Street Journal.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.200]   I noticed my New York Times subscription went from,
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.680]   I think it was like $18 every four weeks to 25.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.400]   And I went online and said, "No, that's too much."
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.800]   And they said, "Well, what if it was $4 every four weeks?"
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.160]   And I was like, "Well, I'll take $4."
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.960]   So that's one way to kind of lower that.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.560]   I will say that I don't know if you have access
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.240]   to all the online cancellation options
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.820]   on the New York Times website unless you live in California.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.760]   So I would say either VPN to California,
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.920]   if you have a VPN or ask a friend in California
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.760]   to do it for you.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.960]   Otherwise, you might have to do a phone call or a live chat.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.000]   There's some law that requires you to be able
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.620]   to cancel subscriptions online in California
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.120]   that doesn't apply everywhere.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.020]   That might've changed,
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.000]   but at least a couple of years ago, that was true.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   So one app I've been loving lately is called DaisyDisk.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.920]   If you have a Mac and you wanna just figure out
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.480]   what's using all your hard drive space,
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.880]   it's really great and better
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.120]   than all the other ones I've tried.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.300]   It even supports Dropbox and Google Drive
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.200]   to analyze where your space is going there.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.280]   And then last is a site I'm really excited about
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.920]   called OwnWell.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.560]   The way this works is in a lot of states,
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.320]   you can appeal your property appraisal
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.200]   and therefore lower your property tax.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.600]   I didn't realize how possible this was.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.900]   For people who live in Texas,
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.120]   I guess you get a lot of mail about this.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.940]   In California, you don't.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.440]   But I got connected with the founder of this company
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.320]   because one of his investors
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.340]   is one of the investors of my last company.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.500]   And effectively, they go out and do all the work
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.820]   to create the comps and the data and the backend,
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:24.540]   file with the county or whatever the regulatory body is.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.380]   And if it gets to a hearing,
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.140]   we'll represent you at the hearing
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.860]   to help push for lower property appraisals.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.060]   So I went through this entire process with them
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.760]   and the amount we're pushing for on our property
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.060]   is about 17% lower than what we're currently at,
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.160]   which would save us meaningful amounts of money every year.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.560]   And thanks to Prop 13 in California,
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.960]   if you do this once, it'll go on forever.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.800]   They also operate in Georgia, Texas, Florida,
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.600]   and parts of New York, Illinois, and Washington.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.200]   The service is free,
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.100]   but any amount of money that they save you
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.920]   on your property tax,
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.500]   they take 25% of for that first year.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.760]   So you can go through this entire process yourself.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.620]   I started doing it just to try to understand it.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.480]   And then I realized the number of hours
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.080]   I was gonna spend to go build these models
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.000]   and do them in the very specific way
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.820]   that the county requires,
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.960]   which isn't always published, is just too much work.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.200]   So big fan of them.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.120]   I actually asked him if he could do anything
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.640]   for our listeners,
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.560]   and he offered to put $25 off
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.640]   any of the services anyone uses.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.640]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/ownwellocean,
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.800]   O-W-N-W-E-L-L,
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.200]   you can sign up and get that deal.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.400]   Wow, okay, that's it.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.680]   I was long overdue for one of these episodes.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.220]   I really hope it was valuable.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.300]   I love doing them,
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.280]   and I'm gonna start trying to do them a bit more regularly.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.800]   Keep questions coming,
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.760]   keep your tips, hacks, and wins coming.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.080]   All of those can come to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.280]   And two more things.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.240]   First, if you have a few minutes this week,
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.680]   I would greatly appreciate it
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.480]   if you could fill out the All the Hacks survey.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.380]   It would mean so much to me.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.640]   You can do that at allthehacks.com/survey
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.120]   or the link in the show notes.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.040]   And I will keep you guys posted by email
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   if you are the winner of a $100 Viore gift card
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.900]   on any Day Essentials cookware set
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.160]   or a free ticket on United.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.640]   Second, as for the giveaway I mentioned earlier,
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.760]   if you haven't already seen the trailer,
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.100]   there is a new movie out called "Dumb Money,"
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.240]   which I'm really excited to watch.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.000]   The movie chronicles the meme stock craziness back in 2021,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.640]   and specifically the GameStop short squeeze
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.140]   and the journey of Keith Gill, AKA Roaring Kitty.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.980]   It's got an 84/85 on Rotten Tomatoes,
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.900]   and the cast includes Pete Davidson,
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.680]   Seth Rogen, Nick Offerman, Shailene Woodley,
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.780]   and a bunch more.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.060]   If you wanna check it out,
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.720]   I have 20 free download codes for you all.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:56.540]   I'm gonna put them up at allthehacks.com/dumbmoney.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.940]   And if you go to that URL
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.620]   and it ends up redirecting you to the All the Hacks survey,
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.860]   then you'll know they've already been claimed.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.680]   Also, just for full transparency,
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:08.220]   the PR firm for the movie didn't pay me to talk about this,
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.820]   but the movie actually looked really good,
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.460]   and they offered 20 free download codes for listeners,
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.700]   so I figured it'd be worth sharing with all of you.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.620]   Okay, thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:17.660]   That's all for this week.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.860]   I will see you next week.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.880]   (birds chirping)
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:40.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
