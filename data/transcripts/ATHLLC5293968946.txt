[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.400]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.480]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.120]   and it's been a while since I did a solo mailbag episode,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.640]   and that's long overdue,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.320]   but I am so excited for this one
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.480]   because I think the timing will be so helpful
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.960]   for anyone who has upcoming travel these holidays,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.280]   because I'm gonna cover everything you need to know
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.300]   when things go wrong with your travel.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.760]   That means delays, cancellations, missed flights,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.000]   sold out hotels and rental cars,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.140]   some preventative measures you should take, and a lot more.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.560]   I'm also gonna cover a few other travel topics,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   including some recent news and deals,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.780]   tips for earning companion pass for two years,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.560]   a card that earns three X points on everything for a year,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.080]   and a lot more.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.720]   But before we jump in,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.080]   I wanna share that our annual listener survey
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   is live as of today at allthehacks.com/survey,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.040]   where it's linked in the show notes,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.520]   and it would absolutely mean the world to me
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.800]   if you could spend a few minutes to take it.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.120]   Your feedback is one of the major ways
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440]   I'm gonna decide how we focus all of our time and energy
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.480]   with all the hacks next year.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.920]   However, I wanna give you a little more incentive
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.040]   to help out, so we have three incredible giveaways
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.340]   for this year's survey.
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.800]   First, we have a $100 gift card to Viore,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.720]   a long-time partner of the show,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.440]   and currently at least 50% of my weekly wardrobe,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.480]   thanks to them having the most comfortable
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.400]   performance apparel in the world.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.120]   Seriously, I'm wearing it almost every single day,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.540]   and if you can't wait for the giveaway,
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.200]   go to allthehacks.com/viore to get 20% off your order.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.400]   Next, we have a free Any Day, Every Day cookware set.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920]   And if you're not familiar with Any Day,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.120]   go back and listen to episode 122,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.840]   where Chef David Chang and I talked about Any Day,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   and how it's completely changed our home cooking game
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200]   by unlocking the power of the microwave.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.940]   We use our Any Day cookware almost every single day,
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.020]   so if you wanna check them out,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.600]   you can go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   and get 15% off your purchase.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.880]   Finally, for me and Amy at All The Hacks,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.600]   we're giving away a round-trip economy class certificate
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000]   on United, valid for travel to or from the US,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.360]   excluding Hawaii, valid for travel to and from
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.560]   the 48 United States, Alaska, Canada, Caribbean,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.500]   Mexico, and Central America.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.800]   So I really hope someone takes an epic adventure with that.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   Please consider taking a few minutes
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.600]   to take the survey this week at allthehacks.com/survey.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120]   I would really appreciate it,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320]   and we'll be emailing the giveaway winners in a few weeks.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.280]   Okay, there is so much good stuff
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.880]   to cover in today's episode,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.980]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.200]   Oh, and one more thing, I got 20 free download codes
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.500]   for the new movie, "Dumb Money,"
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.920]   which I'm gonna talk about in the outro of today's episode,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.320]   so keep listening for that.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.240]   The holidays are rapidly approaching,
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.800]   and Trade is here to help you nail gift-giving this year.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.640]   Trade is the gift of better coffee at home.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.680]   From subscriptions to limited edition gift boxes,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.840]   there's something for everyone in your life,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.320]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.580]   I know so many people who love Trade,
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.600]   but if you're not familiar, Trade is a subscription service
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.400]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.240]   and brings it to your doorstep.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.340]   They've built relationships with more than 50 local roasters
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.800]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   from the comfort of your own home.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.560]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.840]   sign up for a subscription
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.200]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.280]   And if you're on the fence, take it from my wife, Amy.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.520]   - I love Trade coffee.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.840]   I think it's so good.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.440]   It's something I look forward to waking up to
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.700]   every single morning
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.560]   because I'm able to have the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.500]   specifically the way I like it,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.720]   without ever having to leave my house.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.280]   And recently, I got a bag of Huck coffee beans
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.820]   from Colorado, which is my home state.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.520]   I loved it so much that for my dad's birthday,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.080]   I gifted him a subscription to Trade Coffee,
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400]   and now he's just as obsessed as I am.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.520]   - Give the gift of better coffee at home,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.620]   buy yourself a Trade subscription
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.680]   and enjoy your first bag free.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.720]   Or send one of Trade's holiday gift boxes to a loved one
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.300]   and enjoy free shipping for a limited time.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.700]   Visit allthehacks.com/trade to get brewing.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.000]   That's allthehacks.com/trade,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.800]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.600]   Okay, so I wanted to do this episode
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.920]   because well, first, so many of you have emailed
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.500]   asking questions about this topic,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.720]   but also because there's a lot of holiday travel coming up
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200]   and I really wanna make sure you all are prepared,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.920]   but this information isn't just holiday specific.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.940]   So it should be helpful to anyone
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.000]   who has plans to travel in the future,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.880]   which I hope is just about everyone listening.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.680]   So let's start with a couple general tips.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.840]   First, keep in mind whenever you're in a tricky situation,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.680]   three Ps, patient, polite, and persistent.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.960]   Whoever you're dealing with is probably dealing
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.400]   with tons of passengers problems or other guests problems
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.100]   and might only have limited information for you.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.940]   So using things like please and thank you
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.520]   and just generally being nice,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.080]   I think is one of the most valuable tactics
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   for making sure that you have a good outcome.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.040]   And if you know you're in the right
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   and their rep who you're working with
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.340]   isn't doing enough to fix things,
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.760]   I'd say hold your ground, speak to their manager,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.080]   or just try again.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.240]   The persistent thing doesn't always mean
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   sticking with the same person.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   If I'm calling up an airline and someone isn't able to help
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.800]   and I just think I'm getting nowhere,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.240]   I'll just hang up, call again,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.340]   and see if I can get someone else.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.120]   The next broad thing I wanna remind you about
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.760]   is credit card benefits.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.400]   So there are a lot of credit card benefits
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   I'll talk about in this episode
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.820]   because there are so many travel perks
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.220]   that you get with your credit cards,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.860]   but I'm not gonna go through all the nuance and detail.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.080]   So episode 113 of all the hacks
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   was about all the hidden credit card benefits.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.060]   So if you wanna go deeper on that topic, you can go there.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.700]   And then on insurance,
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.260]   we're gonna talk a little bit about travel insurance,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.100]   but I've done two episodes covering the topic in the past,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.060]   so I just wanna point you that direction.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.340]   Episode 104 was all about insurance,
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.380]   and at the end we covered travel.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.820]   And then episode 110 with Nomadic Matt,
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.400]   about 35 minutes in we talked about travel.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.100]   My general thought on travel insurance
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.380]   is that make sure you're not paying for something
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.420]   that you already get from your credit cards.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.380]   You'll need to go on a per credit card basis
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.040]   to see what's going on and what's offered,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.380]   but many credit cards cover a lot of things.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.660]   However, if you're going on something specialized,
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.780]   if you're going on a cruise and you wanna make sure
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.620]   that you're gonna get a refund for something expensive,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.560]   if you're trying to cover a unique sport,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.700]   or you're really worried if another pandemic kicks up,
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.460]   all of those things might be worth
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.460]   a more detailed look at travel insurance.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.980]   I'm not gonna get too deep in there,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.180]   but I just wanted to flag that up front.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.360]   And for anytime I mentioned an episode,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.380]   if it's episode 66,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.060]   feel free to just go to allthehacks.com/66,
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.580]   and that'll take you straight to the page for the episode.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.420]   If you click the link for Spotify or Apple Podcasts,
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.460]   it'll jump you right to the episode within those apps.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.860]   For other apps, you're gonna have to scroll
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.060]   and search for it, but hopefully that's helpful.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.300]   All right, let's start with air travel.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.740]   And there is a lot here.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.480]   So first I'm gonna talk about cancellations and delays.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.340]   Before you go into any of these situations,
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.780]   I would say there are a few things
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.580]   that you can do to prepare.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.180]   So one is just making sure you know what's covered.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.740]   So look at your credit card,
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.740]   look at the airline policies, anything like that.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.100]   I always try to monitor my booking
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.860]   just to see what's happening as early as possible.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.140]   Time is really, really helpful in these circumstances.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.180]   So I use an app called Flighty, which is amazing,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.320]   and I get push notifications from them
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.300]   as soon as the schedule's changed.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.060]   Oftentimes I've gotten notifications sooner
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.700]   than I got them from the airline from Flighty.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.240]   I recently signed up again for TripIt Pro,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.340]   which right now is about $40 a year.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.200]   I think Flighty's about the same price, around $50 a year.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.900]   But the thing that I'm interested in TripIt Pro,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.620]   which I'll get to later in this conversation,
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.840]   is around price drops, but they also have monitoring.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.740]   And I'm gonna be curious to compare Flighty and TripIt Pro
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.380]   and the airlines the next time we're leaving.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.300]   The other thing for really important travel,
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.620]   time-sensitive events, is booking a backup.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.860]   And now in a world where there are free cancellations,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.940]   I think it's really, really worth doing
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.040]   if something's really urgent or timely.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.160]   For example, for this Thanksgiving,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.620]   we had a really, really early morning flight,
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.940]   and we decided we weren't gonna take it
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.000]   because it's just gonna be a little too crazy.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.900]   So we booked a little bit of a later flight,
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.680]   but the first flight was on Southwest, so I just kept it.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.720]   We booked it with points.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.660]   I know if I cancel it, I'll get the points back
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.060]   as long as I cancel it 10 minutes
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.960]   before the flight takes off.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.480]   And so we'll just leave it there.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.640]   On the off chance the flight we are taking gets canceled
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.400]   sometime before schedule changes something,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.760]   we've got that backup.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.460]   I don't always book a backup,
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.840]   but especially if I make changes,
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.140]   I might as well keep it because it's already there.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.200]   But if you have something really time-sensitive,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   I think booking something that comes with free cancellations
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.800]   or totally refundable is something you could do
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.200]   to protect yourself.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.440]   But that's what you can do in advance.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.780]   What do you do when you find out
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.420]   that your flight is canceled or there's a delay?
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.760]   Well, in some cases, it can be a huge bummer,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.460]   especially if you're right at the airport
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.060]   and it's messing all your plans.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.640]   But if this happens in advance,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.120]   it can be a huge advantage
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.040]   because when your flights get canceled or changed,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.680]   the airlines have to help you.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.440]   So sometimes that could mean
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.960]   you're gonna miss your connection that you had booked
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.360]   because it was way cheaper than a direct flight
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.080]   and you can use that to get on a direct flight.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.520]   So what you're gonna do is you're gonna wanna get in touch
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.600]   with the airline as soon as possible.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.520]   Bypassing all of the phone menus to reach a human
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.880]   is something that I think will be helpful.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   So here's how I think about it.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.900]   I call and I say existing reservation,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.000]   depending on the airline,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.800]   and I almost always just say agent
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.140]   or press zero until someone answers.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.880]   Every now and then, maybe it's weather,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.280]   maybe it's a technical system for an airline,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.760]   and you just aren't gonna get a human
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.540]   and there's really long hold times.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.840]   Whenever that happens,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.680]   I try to call one of those airline desks in another country.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.360]   So for example, if you're flying on United,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.200]   United has desks in Japan, in the UK.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.800]   You could call those numbers
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.240]   for usually a very nominal fee
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.720]   using a service like Google Voice.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.680]   I think it's usually like a cent a minute.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.080]   Some plans, if you have US Mobile, for example,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.160]   just include free international calling.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.880]   So that is where I go if I'm not having any luck.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.460]   It's also a tactic I use if I'm trying to get an agent
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.720]   outside of business hours in the US.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.700]   And if you're at the airport
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.360]   and there's a massive line at the gate,
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.080]   some airports have customer service desks.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.240]   And if that doesn't work,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.080]   there's usually reps that can help you
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.780]   inside of an airline lounge.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.080]   So if you have access to the United Club,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.240]   when you're flying United, you could go in there.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.080]   Worst case, if security wasn't that long
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.880]   and you wanted to talk to someone faster,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   you could leave security
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.300]   and go to one of the ticketing desks
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.600]   and the check-in desks.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.240]   So basically the goal here
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.420]   is to get a person as fast as possible.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.100]   If you're 50th in line,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.840]   there are 49 people that are gonna get a flight rebooked
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.400]   on something else before you.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.000]   So if you can get on the phone to someone
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.680]   or get to a person sooner,
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   you're gonna have a higher likelihood
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.320]   of getting a better option.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.200]   So that's how you get your flights changed.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.820]   But as far as compensation,
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.600]   when an airline cancels the flight
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.000]   or makes a significant change,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.280]   you're gonna be able to get a refund for sure,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.920]   even on a non-refundable ticket.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.540]   That's according to US Department of Transportation rules.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.360]   That's also true if the airline moves you
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.160]   to a lower class of service.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.640]   If you were flying in business class
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.920]   and a flight was changed,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.000]   and that meant that there weren't enough business class seats
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.300]   and you got bumped down.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.480]   But usually you can actually get a bit more compensation
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.560]   than just a refund,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.840]   especially if you're not canceling entirely on the airline.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.600]   If you're willing to let them put you on another flight,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.880]   sometimes that's $100.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.840]   Sometimes that's an upgrade to first class.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.200]   Sometimes that's 20,000 miles.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.440]   Sometimes it's $500.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.600]   It really depends.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.080]   But I would absolutely,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.840]   anytime an airline is inconveniencing you,
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.720]   ask them for something for that inconvenience.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.000]   Even if they don't give you something in the moment,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.400]   I would follow up by email,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.000]   follow up by a phone call,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.640]   and you'd be surprised what happens.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.160]   I know right now we just booked flights next year on Delta,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.520]   and we took $375 off those flights
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.760]   because we had $325 certificates from Delta
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.400]   because there was a major change
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.660]   to a reservation we had earlier this year.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.900]   Also, if missing the flight is your fault,
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.180]   there's this thing that I just recently learned
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.360]   when doing some research called the flat tire rule
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.880]   where most airlines have some rule
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.760]   that will help you get on another flight,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.960]   whether it's a rule or just a common practice,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.360]   if you miss the flight.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.640]   So on American, if you arrive within two hours,
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.240]   you can get booked on the next flight
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.880]   as a standby traveler with no extra fees.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.640]   One time I went to the wrong airport in the DC area.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.680]   I was supposed to go to Reagan National Airport,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.420]   and I went to Dulles, and I was able to get on a flight.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.920]   I can't even remember what airline it was,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.120]   but it was one that flew to both DC airports,
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.320]   so I was lucky there.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.960]   So I would say if you're gonna run late
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.560]   and you're gonna miss your flight,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.740]   at least try calling before you get there,
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.720]   but I'd say you probably have a decent likelihood
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.800]   of being able to standby.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.040]   That doesn't mean you're gonna get on,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.940]   but you probably have a good option.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.760]   And if all of these things happen
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.200]   and you're really struggling
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.320]   and you need to buy something last minute,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.920]   I'll just throw out there that last minute flights
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.360]   using points and miles can sometimes, not always,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.760]   but sometimes be a really great deal.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.500]   So Drew wrote in talking about
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.400]   how he had this exact situation.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.700]   He was going on a trip for work
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.600]   that he was linking together with a personal trip
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.520]   and the work side of it canceled,
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.400]   so they actually canceled his ticket back home,
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.440]   and he was about to be stuck
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.960]   buying a $387 plane ticket,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   but using American Airlines points,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.160]   he was able to get that same flight for 7,500 points,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.940]   which is five cents per point in value, which is awesome.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.920]   And while I usually try to save my points
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.200]   for big trips that I'm planning in advance
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.440]   and business class and premium cabins,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.320]   if something happens on a domestic trip
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.240]   and last minute you need to use some miles,
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.880]   it can be a great way to use up some miles
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.840]   in a program that you don't have a huge balance on.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.120]   So that 7,500 miles that Drew needed for his flight
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.720]   is something that you might have
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.120]   in an airline you don't fly that often
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.920]   that might be able to be a great way to use those points.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.600]   As I'm dialing in my health,
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.280]   I'm starting to see firsthand how important it is
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.760]   to replenish electrolytes, which is why I love Element,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.100]   an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.700]   has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.360]   That means lots of salt with no sugar,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.160]   and I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   It contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.760]   a thousand milligrams of sodium,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.280]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.920]   And if you don't already know why electrolytes are important
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.980]   don't worry, I didn't either,
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.880]   but they facilitate hundreds of functions in the body,
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.960]   including the conduction of nerve impulses,
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.520]   hormone regulation, nutrient absorption, and fluid balance.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.640]   Since I've been using Element,
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.240]   I've noticed a stark improvement in my recovery,
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.860]   but Element can also help with other common symptoms
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.040]   of electrolyte deficiency, like headaches,
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.720]   muscle cramps, fatigue, and sleepiness.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.360]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes

[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.820]   if it's for you, don't worry,

[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.320]   with any purchase.

[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.400]   When I decided I wanted to go full-time on the podcast,
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.760]   I had no idea what it could turn into,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.660]   but now we have a newsletter, a membership,
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.360]   we're organizing trips, and one day,
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   we might wanna open up a store online.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.960]   So if you also have business dreams in your future,
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.720]   you should absolutely be checking out Shopify,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.080]   who I'm excited to be partnering with today.

[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.200]   Next, I talked briefly about credit card benefits before,
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.900]   but specifically a lot of cards have trip delay
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.880]   and trip cancellation insurance.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.280]   You'll be able to get reimbursed for any non-refundable
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.780]   or prepaid expenses
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.400]   if you have to get canceled for a situation.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.520]   Cancellation is often more for you,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.320]   like an unpostponable jury duty or a hospitalization
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.860]   or a major injury.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.080]   Sometimes includes severe weather or named storms,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.880]   usually doesn't include fog and basic stuff like that.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   It's a pretty common insurance that covers,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.940]   you know, three to $10,000.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.000]   So that's something worth keeping in mind.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.480]   I think the best insurances I've seen
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   are probably from Chase and Amex,
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.360]   but even Capital One has trip cancellation insurance
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.280]   as well.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.180]   When it comes to delays, it's another common coverage,
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.980]   which you can be reimbursed for reasonable expenses usually.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.080]   So if you were delayed
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.920]   and you had to spend the night at a hotel
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.080]   that wasn't covered,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.440]   or if you needed to even sometimes buy a meal,
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.540]   that can be covered.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.640]   So oftentimes this is a much smaller coverage,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.360]   so maybe $500 a person
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.700]   and might require a really meaningful delay,
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.360]   six to 12 hours, not just two hours.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.760]   As for getting compensation,
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.240]   if you're trying to get compensation from an airline
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.000]   and you're not having success,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.920]   it's definitely worth filing a complaint
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.580]   with the Department of Transportation.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.760]   That can sometimes get more eyeballs than you think,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.120]   and it actually counts against the airlines.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.200]   So I think they really try to respond to these
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.180]   if it gets to that,
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.240]   but I've never had to go to that point.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.920]   So hopefully you don't as well.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.480]   And by the way, if you're doing all of these things
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.200]   and if flights are canceled and you need to move around
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.220]   and you've already checked your bag,
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.360]   usually you'll have to go back to the baggage carousel
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.200]   to pick it up and then reload and recheck it on.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.980]   Some airlines might also try to just reroute the bag
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.120]   to your final destination
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.580]   if you're staying on that airline,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.320]   but just keep that in mind during this process.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.400]   It's one of the reasons we used to never love checking bags,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.000]   and then we had children and now it's not really an option.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.180]   So we're checking bags,
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.600]   but I'll get to what to do with bags in a little bit.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.160]   I mentioned if you do miss your first flight,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.920]   but what about when you're on a layover?
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.900]   So first off, I think it's really important
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.820]   to consider planning for layovers properly.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.400]   I think we used to plan for them differently
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.200]   without children than we do now,
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.680]   but I always try to have enough time.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.260]   There's something called a MCT or a minimum connection time
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.000]   where different airports have an amount of time
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.320]   at which they'll let you book a connection,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   but some of those minimum connection times
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.200]   are totally crazy.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.360]   Especially in Europe,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.600]   there are times where I've seen connections
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.200]   that I know are gonna be across a very large airport
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.880]   and it's allowed to book something for 45 minutes.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.880]   I can't remember what the minimum connection time is
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.840]   for Charles de Gaulle in Paris,
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.000]   but if I were to book a flight and it said,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.440]   "Oh, it's okay to book a 50-minute layover in Paris,"
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.380]   I wouldn't book that flight.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.100]   Our au pair is going back to Italy over Thanksgiving,
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.240]   and there are a few options that were bookable
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.820]   with 45 to 60-minute layovers in international airports.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.780]   I just wouldn't book that
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.060]   because it seems like you're putting yourself
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.680]   in a situation where you are likely to have an issue.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.320]   So I try to plan a buffer.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.560]   I also like to just search online
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.100]   for how long it takes to walk between terminals.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.880]   Anyone who's been to a very small airport
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.480]   knows that a 30-minute layover could be fine.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.800]   So sometimes if you do a search online,
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.280]   either results on Reddit or TripAdvisor
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.420]   or Flyertalk come up,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.400]   but I'll search LAX, how long to walk
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.460]   from terminal two to terminal seven.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.820]   And you'll usually find someone out there on the internet
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.540]   who has done that or even asked that question before
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.200]   and someone who responded.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.420]   So that's great.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.520]   If you do miss a connection,
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.060]   one other important thing is sometimes I will try
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.240]   to save money by booking two separate airlines
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.600]   and connecting them.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.860]   Obviously, if you check bags,
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.160]   you're gonna need a lot of extra time
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.960]   to go retrieve your bags and recheck them
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.600]   'cause airlines usually won't connect through,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.220]   maybe if they're on the same alliance,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.340]   but often if they're on separate tickets,
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.480]   that's gonna be tricky.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.040]   One important thing to remember in that circumstance
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.920]   is that because you are on separate tickets,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.480]   the second airline isn't just gonna automatically care
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.840]   that the first airline was delayed.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.000]   They're gonna treat you just like you missed your flight,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.560]   got to the airport late,
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.440]   and potentially slightly worse
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.120]   for not just booking the entire flight through that airline.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.760]   So I would leave a ton of extra time
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.640]   if you're connecting between two airlines
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.520]   that aren't partners that weren't booked on the same ticket.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.600]   But if you are on all the same airline
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.360]   and you are missing a flight due to a late takeoff
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.000]   or some other mechanical issue,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.360]   the airline is responsible
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.960]   for getting you on the next flight
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.340]   and even offering you accommodation or meal vouchers
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.220]   if you're stuck overnight or at a long period at the airport.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.480]   So keep that in mind.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.840]   Depending on where you're traveling,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.920]   it might not be required,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.640]   but it's pretty standard practice.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.840]   So I would just push for it
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.160]   if it's not being voluntarily given to you.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.520]   If you do have to cancel a non-refundable ticket
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.560]   and it ends up happening after the flight is taken off,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.360]   I would try to contact the airline as fast as possible.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.060]   It's very likely you're not gonna get anything back.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.720]   Though sometimes in Europe,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.360]   if you have a non-refundable ticket
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.760]   and you have to cancel it,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.040]   you can at least get your taxes back.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.300]   That's not always true in the US,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.940]   but in Europe I've had that situation
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.600]   where it's still worth canceling a non-refundable ticket
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.560]   to at least get your taxes back.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.300]   Debbie wrote in asking for a rule of thumb on layovers.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.940]   My general rule of thumb is at least an hour
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.080]   if I'm very comfortable with the airport
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.420]   and I know how it's laid out
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.080]   and I know I'm not gonna be running between terminals
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.760]   and I'm not traveling for some super sensitive,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.020]   timely thing, 30, 45 minutes is okay.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.680]   One of the really cool features of a lot of travel apps,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.340]   but specifically within the Flighty app
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.800]   is that you see the average delay times.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.520]   You can see how frequently this flight gets in early or late
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.560]   and if you're on a kind of route where it's constantly late,
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.940]   that might make you feel differently
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.020]   versus I know a lot of times long flights
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.500]   between Japan and the US typically get in a little bit early
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.740]   so you might feel a little better there,
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.900]   but obviously you're gonna have to go through immigration.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.020]   International is a whole different bag,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.420]   especially in other countries with immigration
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.140]   that you're not sure how long it may or may not take.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.340]   The only hacks I have there in the US,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.320]   the US Passport app and Global Entry
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.580]   are great options to speed up time
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.820]   and then if you are eligible for the APEC Business Card
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.260]   because you do business overseas in Asia
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.960]   or any of the APEC region,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.220]   you can upgrade your Global Entry
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.180]   to have an APEC Business Card
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.620]   and that'll get you expedited immigration,
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.140]   basically letting you in the crew lines in APEC countries.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.440]   Now, let's talk about bags a bit more.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.560]   If you do have your bags lost, delayed, damaged,
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.060]   the first thing you're gonna need to do
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.100]   is find the baggage desk of the airline
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.180]   that operated your last flight
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.420]   and that last flight part is important
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.940]   because if you're flying on a ticket
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.740]   that was booked on two passengers,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.740]   you wanna make sure you,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.340]   even though your bag might've been lost
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.840]   by the first airline,
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.620]   the operating carrier of your last flight
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.260]   is the one who's ultimately responsible
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.700]   for getting the bag to you.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.300]   I don't envy anyone in this situation,
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.180]   but that's who you're gonna wanna talk to.
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.380]   You're gonna wanna make sure you file a report
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.260]   before you leave the airport.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.460]   If they tell you they're gonna email you something
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.580]   or ask you to do it later in your hotel,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.340]   don't leave the airport without filing that report
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.860]   for both insurance purposes and tracking purposes.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.500]   It is absolutely something I would want to give them.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.160]   Make sure they have an address for you
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.100]   so they can get your bags to you.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.140]   Airlines generally are pretty good about this.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.140]   When we landed in Hawaii,
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.240]   United didn't get our car seat to us in time.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.540]   We had checked that bag.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.380]   And so a few things I learned there,
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.960]   one, they were really great about offering
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.180]   to get the bag delivered to us the next day.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.500]   They even offered if we didn't need the bag
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.700]   to hold it back in San Francisco
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.980]   so that we could just get it when we get home.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.340]   Unfortunately, we had booked a flight from San Francisco
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.500]   and back to Oakland.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.660]   So we needed that car seat to get home
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.460]   when we landed in Oakland to put in a Lyft or an Uber,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.340]   but they ended up delivering it to us the next day.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.340]   They also offered to loan us a car seat.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.180]   It turns out a lot of airlines have loaner car seats
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.420]   for this exact purpose.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.200]   So that's something to keep in mind.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.380]   I didn't know that and had already gone
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.940]   to the rental car counter and had already paid $120
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.120]   to rent two car seats for the week.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.740]   Fortunately, United also took that receipt.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.020]   They didn't reimburse it directly at the airport,
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.100]   but I uploaded it online, got a check in the mail,
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.200]   and it was totally covered.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.620]   So shout out to United for at least handling that situation
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.500]   as well as they could have outside of the fact
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.460]   that they did not bring the bag.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.620]   So when you do have these situations,
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.500]   you are eligible for some kind of compensation.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.540]   Every airline has a different policy.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.020]   United is for expenses based on proof of claim.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.540]   Delta allows reasonable expenses,
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.260]   and they generally say about $50 a day.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.020]   It really depends on the circumstance
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.220]   and what was in your bag and what was necessary.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.740]   I would make an argument that if you had an important meeting
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.360]   and you needed a suit, like renting one or buying one
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.680]   might be a reasonable expense,
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.380]   but if you're going on vacation,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.700]   buying a suit probably wouldn't be.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.100]   So I haven't had a lot of experience with lost bags,
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.020]   so I don't have a lot of anecdotes here.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.260]   Feel free if you have specific ones to share them
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.980]   so I can let people know.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.220]   But in general, I would definitely try to get
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.980]   some sort of reimbursement for anything that you needed.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.820]   But honestly, the hassle of talking to someone
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.500]   and going through this process,
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.380]   if you're just trying to get reimbursement
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.340]   to get reimbursement might not be worth it.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.620]   Though some of these airlines
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.340]   make it really easy to do online.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.100]   When it comes to reimbursement delay,
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.860]   baggage is actually something
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.840]   that is not very common on credit cards.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.780]   I have seen a few chase cards with it, so take a look,
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.460]   but it usually requires at least a six hour delay
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.880]   and it's capped at $100, so it's not gonna be that big.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.740]   But one really important thing is keeping track of receipts.
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.980]   Depending on the airline,
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.460]   they may or may not need receipts for a lot of things.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.120]   I can't remember the threshold at United,
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.080]   I think it was over 75 or $100 they needed a receipt.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.460]   But if you're going out to buy toothbrushes, toothpaste,
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.620]   deodorant, whatever that is, just keep a receipt
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.540]   so you can make sure to get reimbursed.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.020]   If your bags are lost or damaged,
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.900]   that actually is something that is common,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.140]   credit card benefit.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.900]   So if the airline's not gonna cover that,
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.640]   your credit card probably would.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.900]   But I'm not sure actually how hard it will be
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.420]   to prove what was in it and how much it's worth.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.580]   One quick thing, kind of like rental cars
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.780]   that I like to do now is if I'm gonna check a bag,
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.720]   I'll just take a picture of the open bag before I close it,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.880]   just so I can at least have some documentation
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.980]   of what was in there.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.080]   But in general, I'm not putting expensive things in my bag
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.520]   because if it gets lost, at least a bag that's checked,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.900]   I don't have high expectations
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.700]   that something expensive will be covered.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.340]   As for how to avoid this, well, obvious, don't check bags.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.180]   That's an easy one,
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.500]   but for some people that's not possible.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.420]   What I try to do is keep anything valuable
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.600]   and really important in carry-ons.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.680]   I also try to think about a simple journey.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.980]   So if you're gonna save $50 to take one or two stops,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.820]   keep in mind that there's a chance
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.300]   that that affects the likelihood that you get your bag.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.820]   And I'm sure in that moment, it won't be worth it.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.900]   If you're gonna save thousands of dollars, then absolutely.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.260]   I also put Apple AirTags in all of our bags
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.820]   so that at least I have a good sense of where they are.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.060]   From all the experience of people I know,
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.100]   it doesn't actually help get anything resolved
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.160]   other than knowing where things are,
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.700]   but there is some peace of mind
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.900]   being able to sit on the plane before it takes off
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.100]   and just say, "Yep, I know my bags are on the plane."
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.900]   And some airlines actually scan at all these intervals
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.100]   and will update the mobile apps with, "Bag is on the plane,"
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.500]   "Bag made it here," "Bags on the carousel."
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.520]   So that's something to keep in mind as well.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.860]   Now, if your travel does go awry,
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.020]   one awesome recommendation from Katya, who emailed in,
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.860]   said that she has a little hack
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.220]   she's been doing with her daughter,
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.760]   and anytime they have a challenge throughout the trip,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.220]   she pretends with her daughter
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.660]   that they're on an amazing race adventure.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.980]   So for example, she'd experienced a mechanical issue
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.000]   as they were gonna take off,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.700]   and they had to spend a night in a hotel
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.840]   at Heathrow in the UK.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   And so because British Airways didn't make everything clear,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.740]   she kind of made it a game with her daughter.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.900]   And she was like, "Here, we have to get to this hotel.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.820]   "How are we gonna get there?
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.060]   "What's the best way?"
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.760]   And it kind of became a fun event for the family,
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.220]   and it was a lot less frustrating.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.980]   So awesome idea.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.480]   Obviously, I hope no one has to use it,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.660]   but if so, might make traveling with kids
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.660]   in these circumstances a little better.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.140]   So let's move on to hotels.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.620]   In general, I think we're not as used to hotel problems,
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.220]   but there are a few reasons why a hotel
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.420]   might not end up having your reservation.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.660]   So administrative errors is one,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.300]   which is getting better with confirmations.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.540]   Booking through third parties is another.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.420]   For example, I actually helped someone
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.780]   make a reservation just last week,
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.540]   and we called up to confirm something,
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.060]   and the hotel didn't have it.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.820]   And we had a confirmation from a third party,
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.500]   but we did not have a reservation confirmation
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.420]   with the hotel.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.380]   So in general, I would say,
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.720]   if you're booking on a third party,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.300]   which sometimes can save you a lot of money,
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.820]   can get you a lot of perks, is totally worth it,
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.600]   you might wanna make sure you call the hotel
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.760]   just to make sure they have your reservation.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.360]   Some hotels intentionally oversell to maximize profit.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.040]   And then sometimes you have guests that just don't check out.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.760]   I know that might sound crazy to some of us,
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.120]   but any of those could result in your room
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.440]   not being available.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.880]   And similar to guests overstaying,
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.440]   I guess you could also have health,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.320]   cleanliness, mechanical issues.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.940]   So if a room was no longer able to be used,
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.980]   maybe they didn't oversell the hotel,
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.940]   but now the hotel has less capacity
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.000]   because one room's out of service.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.020]   So unlike airlines where there are really clear rules
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.420]   about what happens and what rights people have,
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.200]   there's no government regulations in this area.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.360]   You're almost always gonna be able to get a refund
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.240]   if a hotel can't honor your reservation,
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.400]   but I would be pushing a lot harder
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.520]   for compensation in that circumstance.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.120]   And I would certainly be asking them to book me
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.960]   in a comparable or better hotel nearby.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.600]   And I would be pushing the front desk, the manager, the GM,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.200]   or worst case, calling the hotel loyalty program,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.680]   someone in central reservations at Marriott or Hyatt
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.040]   to see what can be done.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.560]   If your room class isn't available
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.500]   and all they have is suites,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.880]   I wouldn't expect to pay any extra for that.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.600]   So keep all of those things in mind.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.680]   Every hotel chain has some rules published
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.900]   about what they will do,
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.880]   some of them more clear than others.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.040]   But in general, I've found that most hotel chains
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.360]   that you work with will probably find some way
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.520]   to take care of you, but it's up to you to push for it
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.460]   and make sure that you get something reasonable.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.120]   As for how to avoid this,
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.480]   when hotels have to decide how to walk guests,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.680]   there are a few criteria I know they look at.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.200]   People who have booked through a third party,
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.240]   who aren't part of their loyalty program,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.760]   who have never stayed before,
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.940]   who are only staying for one night,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.840]   or who have really, really, really discounted rates
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.360]   are often reasons that you could be chosen
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.720]   for someone who's walked.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.520]   So I think the easiest way to solve that
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.140]   is to just make sure that you join
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.400]   all the hotel loyalty programs
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.640]   and add a number to your reservation.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.760]   That one is one where I think it's going to have
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.560]   a huge impact for a very little cost.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.160]   In addition to that, calling ahead, confirming your room,
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.900]   even calling early in the morning
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.960]   and getting a room assigned if you're really, really worried
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.640]   could be something that could help.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.920]   Some hotels allow you to check in online,
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.120]   you could check in early, or you could just book direct.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.980]   I think booking direct is always gonna give you
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.160]   a little edge here, but at the end of the day,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.340]   if you can save 30, 40% booking elsewhere,
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.480]   I think that could be worth it
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.240]   just know that in these rare circumstances,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.040]   you might not be on the same playing field
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.640]   as someone who booked direct.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.760]   Last on hotels is just when things go wrong in the hotel.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.600]   If you check into your room, something's not working,
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.400]   there's a weird smell,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.280]   I've had a couple of situations like this.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.780]   In that circumstance, I wouldn't try to wait it out.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.840]   I would just immediately call down and say,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.200]   this is what's wrong with the room,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.000]   can you get me in something else?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.980]   Oftentimes that something else will be a little bit nicer,
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.340]   or you'll get some bonus points,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.640]   or some free drinks or something like that.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.440]   I don't try to use this to my advantage,
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.140]   I'm not looking for problems in a room
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.480]   when I'm going into them.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.920]   But when we were staying in Bora Bora,
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.360]   the air conditioner wasn't working.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.280]   And so that was certainly a reason to ask for a new room.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.880]   And we tried calling to get it fixed.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.940]   It was late, we were trying to go to bed, someone came,
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.240]   they said they fixed it.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.840]   And if it didn't work in 30 minutes to call back,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.460]   we called back in 30 minutes, it wasn't fixed,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.640]   no one answered.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.520]   And so we actually ended up staying in the room.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.780]   And the next morning I went to the front desk and said,
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.200]   hey, our room's air conditioner isn't working,
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   can we get a new room?
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.780]   They were great, they put us in a new room.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.380]   And I asked them, I didn't demand it necessarily,
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.080]   but I said, hey, given that last night
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.980]   the air conditioner wasn't working all night,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.460]   do we need to pay for that night?
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.300]   And they said, no, no, no,
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.140]   we'll take that night off your bill, which was awesome.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.820]   I wasn't gonna put up a fight if they said no,
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.020]   but it never hurts to ask.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.740]   If my voice sounds a little different right now,
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.900]   it's 'cause I'm recording this
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.760]   after I recorded the whole episode.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.540]   But on the topic of hotels,
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.220]   I wanted to share something I've been working on
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.400]   for a while.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.240]   If you've listened,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.520]   you know that we have a luxury upgrade program
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.000]   that can give you access to some really awesome
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.040]   exclusive benefits at about 4,000 luxury hotels
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   around the world.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.300]   Think five-star hotels like Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt,
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.660]   Ondas, St. Regis, Ritz-Carlton, that kind of stuff,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.300]   as well as some boutique hotels.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.780]   And you usually get daily breakfast for two,
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.580]   a hundred dollar property credit, free wifi,
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.040]   and a free upgrade if it's available,
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.780]   and early and late checkout if those are available.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.900]   And so the way this had worked before
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.220]   is you have to send an email
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.860]   and include all this information,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.820]   and we'd try to help you out with it.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.300]   Well, I'm really excited that we finally built a site
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.460]   where you can do all of this on your own.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.980]   So if you go to hotels.allthehacks.com,
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.860]   you can actually do a search yourself
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.780]   for these exclusive deals and perks and benefits.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.720]   You can either search by property or search by city,
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.020]   and when the results come up,
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.780]   just make sure to click view details,
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.500]   and you'll get a list of all the rooms,
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.000]   and you'll see whether they have
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.420]   All The Hacks preferred rates or Virtuoso amenities.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.380]   And when you click view full description,
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.820]   you'll get all the details.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.460]   So for example, I just quickly searched for London,
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.940]   and the first hotel that pulled up
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.740]   was the Great Scotland Yard, which is a Hyatt hotel.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   And it says one king bedroom, highlights,
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.660]   Hyatt Preve breakfast for two, welcome amenity,
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.180]   hundred dollar property credit,
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.940]   early check-in, late checkout, room upgrade.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.700]   So hopefully this is an awesome tool
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.580]   for anyone looking to book a luxury hotel
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.220]   and get some extra perks.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.860]   The rates are not gonna be any different
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.520]   than you would find for a standard rate on the website,
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.520]   but you are gonna get some benefits.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.980]   If you've already gotten perks like this
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.540]   through a program like Amex's Fine Hotels and Resorts,
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.280]   or what Chase and Capital One have offered,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.440]   you'll be familiar.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.300]   The only difference here is I'm pretty sure
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.180]   we have about 4,000 hotels,
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.500]   and each of those programs has anywhere from three or 400,
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.820]   to I think Amex has a little over 2,000.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.760]   So we have a bit of a broader set,
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.300]   and from what I've been told
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.660]   from the travel partner we're working with,
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.300]   that because all these reservations
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.560]   are actually getting routed through a boutique travel agency,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.020]   you'll probably have slightly better preference or priority
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.180]   over the reservations going through a bigger platform
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.740]   like Amex or Chase.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.140]   That said, find the best deals you can,
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.220]   but I just wanted to let you know
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.340]   that we made this site available to everyone,
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.300]   and hopefully it can hook you up on a future trip.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.340]   All right, let's move on from hotels.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.560]   There is nothing like watching your kids grow up so fast
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.620]   to make you realize that you're not getting
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.900]   any younger either.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.040]   So if you're like me,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.580]   and the number of birthday candles keeps going up,
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.020]   and you don't have a life insurance policy yet,
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.540]   then check out our sponsor today, Fabric.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.420]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.140]   to help you get a high quality,
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.080]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.700]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.740]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.940]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.460]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.220]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.140]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.400]   And you could go from start to covered

[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.640]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.180]   not available in certain states,
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.780]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.080]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.100]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.040]   but the reality is I'm not.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.220]   But if you're a long time listener,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.660]   you might know I've been drinking AG1 for about two years.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.540]   When I started drinking AG1 daily,
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.300]   it was to help with daily nutrition,
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.340]   but I also felt a real difference
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.500]   in the energy I had every day.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.740]   So it's been in my routine ever since.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.100]   And that's because AG1
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.400]   is a foundational nutrition supplement
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.800]   that supports your body's universal needs
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.480]   like gut optimization, stress management, and immune support.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.280]   Since 2010, AG1 has led the future
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.900]   of foundational nutrition,
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.000]   continuously refining their formula
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.740]   to create a smarter, better way
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.040]   to elevate your baseline health.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.420]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.140]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.180]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.780]   and energized for the day,
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.340]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.940]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.160]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.100]   with less than one gram of sugar
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.820]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.820]   It's just another reason I'm excited
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.140]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.900]   If you wanna take ownership of your health,

[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.180]   All right, moving on to car rentals.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.220]   We did a really deep dive episode
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.860]   with Jonathan Weinberg from Auto Slash in episode 66.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.220]   So if you wanna go deep on car rentals, check that out.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.860]   But a few tips here.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.740]   One, a lot of rental car reservations
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.140]   require no upfront payment
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.900]   and there's no cancellation fees.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.460]   So if you're really worried
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.940]   that your car might not be available,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.060]   you're welcome to book a backup.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.940]   Some rental car companies might look at a backup
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.300]   under the same name at the same place negatively.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.820]   So you could book it in a spouse's name
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.340]   or book it at two companies.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.000]   Two companies might be a little bit safer
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.940]   because if a rental car company
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.500]   just doesn't have a car for you,
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.260]   then it doesn't matter if you have one reservation or two.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.500]   There are some policies
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.800]   that seem like they might be changing,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.900]   not necessarily to not give you that flexibility
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.140]   of booking backups,
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.460]   but saying if you don't cancel
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.840]   before you're supposed to pick it up,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.920]   you might get charged a fee.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.780]   So definitely keep an eye on those rules
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.780]   as they might evolve.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.420]   And by the way, that's exactly why
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.080]   I think some of these can be problems.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.260]   With so many people being able
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.800]   to book car rental reservations
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.500]   and no penalties for not canceling them,
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.140]   it's really hard for rental car companies
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.500]   to manage inventory.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.300]   So they're obviously gonna be overselling
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.360]   and when everyone picks their car up,
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.380]   they're gonna have an issue
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.660]   and you're not gonna have a car.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.300]   So in that circumstance,
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.220]   if a car rental runs out of cars,
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.040]   absolutely, if they offer you an upgrade to a next class,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.280]   make sure that you're not paying for it.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.540]   If they say, "We don't have your class,
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.540]   but we can put you here,"
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.780]   that is an immediate,
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.060]   I would be happy to upgrade,
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.040]   but I would like to have that upgrade for free.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.940]   It's pretty standard industry practice
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.760]   to go book you into a car from a competitor.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.180]   So if they don't have a rental car,
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.400]   I would ask for that and I would push for it.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.820]   If you have to take a cab
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.180]   or go farther to get to your other rental car,
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.840]   I would expect that rental car company
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.380]   to cover that as well.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.720]   If you're looking in advance
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.940]   and you just don't see cars
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   because you didn't book early enough,
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.340]   a few options here.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.580]   One is to widen your search.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.380]   Don't just look at airports.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.320]   A lot of times the airports are sold out,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.940]   but for example, in Park City one year,
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.620]   we just couldn't get an SUV for the family at the airport.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.800]   They were all sold out,
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   but we looked in downtown Salt Lake City
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.180]   and there were plenty of cars.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.960]   So actually, as soon as we landed,
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.440]   one of us took a lift over
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.360]   while everyone collected bags and all that stuff,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.020]   and then we came back and picked everyone else up.
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.060]   So that was a good option.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.140]   If you have a lot of stuff,
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.020]   if you don't have a lot of stuff,
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.360]   you could just all head there.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.660]   But looking at those neighborhood branches can help.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.740]   If you do have elite status with rental car companies,
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.300]   which a lot of credit cards,
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.260]   the Venturex, the Amex Platinum,
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.780]   include some coverage,
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.140]   some of them actually include coverage
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   that guarantees you a rental car.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.180]   So even though you might look online and see it sold out,
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.320]   you might be able to call up
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.640]   and guarantee yourself a reservation.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.660]   So that's one.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.740]   And then in general,
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.480]   just when it comes to things going wrong,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.660]   if you rent a car,
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.340]   I would absolutely make sure
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.540]   that you either are insured through their program
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.060]   or use a card that includes insurance.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.400]   I go a little bit deeper in this
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.380]   in the insurance and rental car episodes,
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.820]   but primary rental car coverage is awesome.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.660]   There are a lot of cars that cover it.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.120]   I highly recommend using that
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.160]   to save having to pay for the collision coverage
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.280]   from the rental car company,
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.140]   which is usually a lot more expensive.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.920]   But if you don't have a car insurance policy
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.780]   for your own vehicles,
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.220]   then you'll wanna make sure you have liability coverage
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.260]   because that is not covered by credit cards
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.740]   that offer rental car coverage.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.180]   They're only covering damage to the vehicle.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.380]   They're not covering your liability
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.980]   if you get an accident and cause damage to someone else.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.100]   So a few things you can do in advance,
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.520]   confirm your reservation,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.340]   make sure that you have everything written down.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.900]   If you're worried about your phone dying, print it out,
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.300]   arrive on time,
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.140]   checking in as early as possible.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.460]   You don't wanna give them any reason
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.260]   to think you're not gonna pick up your car.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.820]   So if your flight's late,
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.820]   you could call and let them know you're running late
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.060]   and then have a plan B.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.220]   So always be thinking about what's an option.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.120]   Do you wanna back up?
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.000]   Is there a cab?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.920]   How is that gonna work?
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.620]   So it really depends on the type of trip you're taking
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.860]   and how necessary it is and how mission critical this is
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.660]   and how sold out they are.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.320]   If you look for cars a couple of days before your trip
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.020]   and they're all super cheap, then it's not a problem.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.620]   If a couple of days before your trip,
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.400]   you do a quick search for cars
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.100]   at the airport you're going to
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.460]   and it's completely sold out everywhere
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.660]   or they're all hundreds and hundreds of dollars a day,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.980]   that might be a circumstance
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.000]   where I'd be thinking about backup options
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.080]   or I'd be thinking about calling ahead
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.960]   just to try to make sure I have something.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.940]   And finally, two tips here.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.220]   When you do rent a rental car,
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.320]   I would always make sure you take pictures and walk around.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.680]   And if you notice any damage,
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.780]   make sure to flag it before you leave.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.700]   When we were in Hawaii,
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.940]   the rental car had a bunch of dents in it.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.580]   And so I just made sure that we stopped
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.000]   before we left the lot.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.280]   Right at that gate where you're about to roll over
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.780]   those crazy spikes,
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.020]   and they brought out a piece of paper,
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.060]   we marked all the dents,
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.140]   I took pictures of them, we drove off.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.620]   The last thing you wanna do is return a car
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.820]   and then have to get into an argument
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.380]   about whether you caused damage or it was already there.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.220]   And then especially if you're in a foreign country
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.260]   and you get in an accident,
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.060]   always try to get a police report.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.380]   Some countries that's very, very necessary
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.620]   to get anything covered.
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.940]   Not usually in the US, but overseas it can very much matter.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.100]   So that's something that I would do
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.100]   if you were getting in a car accident with a rental car.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.100]   So that's the main stuff.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.180]   Let's talk about a few other ways things can go awry.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.300]   Getting lost, one of my tips here is
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.260]   Google Maps has offline maps.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.380]   So get that all figured out in advance,
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.500]   download all those maps.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.000]   That way, whether you even are traveling
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.240]   with data on your phone,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.780]   you'll be able to find your way around a city.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.440]   And then last, if you're abroad and something happens,
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.720]   one of the places that can be your best friend
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.580]   is the local embassy for your country.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.020]   So I can't remember the name of the listener
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.240]   who shared a story that I mentioned earlier,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.420]   but they had a problem and they worked with their embassy
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.860]   and they were able to get a lot of support
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.860]   getting things resolved,
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.380]   helping find the right departments
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.060]   within the country to talk about.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.640]   That's just something that I think they're there
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.900]   to help you when you're traveling if something goes wrong.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.980]   So that's something that I would keep in mind.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.520]   As for holiday travel, general tips,
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.740]   book things in advance.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.140]   One thing that I don't always think about booking in advance
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.400]   is airport parking, but there are both two reasons to do it.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.660]   Sometimes you can save money.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.100]   I know I got an email from the Oakland airport saying,
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.620]   book it in advance and save some money.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.540]   So that's cool.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.920]   But also you can sometimes guarantee a spot,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.100]   getting to the airport a little extra early.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.820]   When we went to Hawaii,
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.820]   I saw the longest lines we have ever seen for security.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.420]   It blew my mind, even with pre and clear
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.940]   and some basic status on United,
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.680]   it was at least 45 minutes to go
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.740]   from getting dropped off at SFO through security,
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.880]   which was absolutely crazy.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.940]   What we ended up doing, which certainly saved us time
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.700]   because we actually tracked the people
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.460]   that were getting in line at the same time as us.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.880]   And this doesn't always work at every airport,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.220]   but you can go through any security.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.660]   So at SFO, for example,
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.420]   terminal three is the domestic terminal for United,
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.460]   but it's connected to the international terminal,
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.400]   specifically the G gates.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.660]   And so we saw these ridiculously long lines.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.300]   There must've been at least 50 to 75 people
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.440]   just in the clear line for TSA pre-check plus clear.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.600]   So we actually walked from terminal three
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.080]   to the international terminal,
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.200]   where the line was two people,
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.400]   went through security
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.280]   and then just walked back over to terminal three.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.840]   I'm a hundred percent sure we saved time doing that.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.360]   If we didn't check bags,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   we actually would have made it through a lot faster,
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.160]   but the line just to be able to drop your bags,
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.240]   even if you tagged them yourself was so long.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.360]   So going forward with kids and checking bags,
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.780]   I unfortunately think gone are the days
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.460]   of getting to the airport last minute.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.660]   When it's just me, I'm traveling solo.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.340]   I don't have any bags to check.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.740]   Sure, I might show up 45 minutes before the flight,
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.140]   but around the holidays with family, check bags,
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.540]   that you just can't do that anymore.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.580]   So definitely consider pre-check and clear for your next trip.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.540]   You don't need to enroll your children,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.180]   I believe under a certain age.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.340]   Definitely consider that.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.940]   If you get global entry, you get free pre-check,
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.580]   but if you're not gonna be traveling internationally,
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.500]   I have heard that the wait times to get your appointments
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.740]   and everything for global entry
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.740]   can be a lot longer than pre-check.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.660]   So you could just go pre-check.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.700]   However, there are two tips
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.720]   for getting global entry appointments faster.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.680]   One is you could just do it on demand.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.460]   So if you get global entry,
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.980]   your next time you're coming back
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.300]   from an international trip,
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.220]   you could just go do your appointment there.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.000]   And then two is appointmentscanner.com
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.320]   is an amazing website.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.260]   They'll monitor your local global entry appointment center
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.860]   and send you an email as soon as there's an appointment.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.460]   I've been able to get appointments within a few days
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.460]   using that tactic in the past.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.180]   Those two things will certainly help
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.260]   get you through airport security in advance
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.360]   on your next trip if you don't already have them.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.980]   So that makes up a lot of the when travel goes awry,
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.380]   but there was a bunch of other stuff
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.420]   I wanted to cover in this episode.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.380]   So let's jump through it quickly.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.060]   First off, two awesome wins.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.700]   One from a listener who's asked not to share their name,
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.660]   but in the 18 months since they started
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.340]   seriously playing this game,
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.660]   they have now booked over $115,000 worth of travel
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.860]   with some points left for other things.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.300]   I'm so glad this podcast has helped you save that much.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.780]   Obviously you might not have spent that much on your own,
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.120]   but it's awesome to see what you've been able to do.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.180]   Finally, awesome email from a family of four
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.380]   that was able to do a trip to LA, Tokyo, Singapore,
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.460]   and Bali.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.940]   They have two young boys,
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.700]   and they were able to do it all
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.740]   with a bunch of deals and hacks
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.700]   using points, using discounts,
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.080]   using perks from the upgrade program.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.220]   If you're not familiar there,
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:30.740]   allthehacks.com/upgrade will allow you to book travel
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.340]   and get perks like free breakfast,
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.220]   property credits, and whatnot
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.300]   for over 4,000 hotels worldwide.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.740]   They ended up saving over $15,000 on that trip.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.860]   So awesome, awesome, awesome to hear that story.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.600]   It makes me so, so happy.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.140]   They ended up doing that whole two week trip
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.420]   for only $3,500.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.620]   They priced it out otherwise,
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.340]   and it would have been $18,500.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.260]   Next, I wanna share a mix of deals, travel stuff,
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.740]   and a few awesome tips.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.700]   The first is an awesome bonus for new card holders
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.300]   for the Chase Freedom Unlimited card.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.660]   And that is that you get double cash back,
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.180]   which is actually the same as double points
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.060]   for your entire first year.
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.940]   And they say there's no limit to how much you get.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.100]   So this card typically gets one and a half points
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.080]   on everything, three points on drugstores,
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.160]   three points on dining,
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.880]   and five points on travel through their portal,
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.100]   which means you're actually gonna get 2X
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.300]   all of those numbers, which is really, really crazy.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.660]   The downside is there's not a big welcome bonus,
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.300]   but being able to get 3% on everything,
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.660]   6% on restaurants and drugstores
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:41.320]   is a huge, huge, awesome deal all at no annual fee.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.020]   It's only for one year,
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.380]   but I think if you are spending a lot
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.540]   and are looking for just an everyday workhorse card
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.720]   that you can use, being able to get 6X on restaurants
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.140]   and 3X everywhere else is really unheard of.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.780]   The other really cool thing is that for the first 15 months,
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.640]   there's 0% intro APR.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.880]   I never really thought about it from this perspective
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.820]   until someone reached out to me and proposed this,
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.720]   which I will share probably in more detail in the future.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.000]   But if you wanna think about the benefit
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.700]   of not having to pay off your card in full each month
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.460]   for 15 months, taking all the money
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.420]   you would have otherwise paid it off for
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.420]   and putting it in treasuries
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.900]   or even a high yield savings account,
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.240]   earning an effective 5% or more,
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.340]   that could be a meaningful amount of money too.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.140]   While it doesn't have an intro bonus,
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:32.380]   if there's a card that let's say you put $2,000 a month on,
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.340]   you can only make minimum payments,
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.600]   let's say that allows you to carry a balance of $20,000
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.340]   for on average, let's say seven or eight months.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:46.340]   Well, that $20,000 at 5% for seven months is over $500.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:52.300]   So pretty cool little hack for playing the 0% APR game
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:56.620]   as a way to take your money, invest it and earn a return
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.180]   that potentially, this is where I wanna go deeper
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.620]   in a future episode, could rival the points you earn.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.340]   But in the case of the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.140]   you're getting the points and getting the ability
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.060]   to invest your money instead of pay off your bill.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.820]   So really great win for a card
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.220]   that doesn't have a welcome bonus or an annual fee.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.080]   And in general, if you're playing the Chase ecosystem,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.980]   the way this card works is it's marketed as a cashback card,
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.240]   but it earns ultimate rewards points.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.820]   And if you have a Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.560]   or Sapphire Reserve or an Inc Business Unlimited,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.240]   you can transfer all your ultimate rewards points
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.640]   to airline partners, including the ones you earn
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.260]   with the Freedom Unlimited card.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.460]   So all the links to all the cards
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.860]   that I'm gonna talk about are at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.100]   Signing up with those links does support the show,
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.920]   so I appreciate you going there.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.340]   For the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.060]   this deal doesn't show up at first on that page,
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.100]   but I promise you, if you click through enough,
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.180]   learn more and get started buttons,
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.580]   you will land on a page that has that bonus listed.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.380]   So that's one cool card.
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.140]   When it comes to transfer bonuses,
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.280]   there are a couple right now.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.500]   On the Amex side, you're getting 25% bonus going to JetBlue,
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.820]   20% to Marriott, and 30% to Hilton.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.100]   None of those are exciting enough to get me
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.980]   to want to make a transfer,
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.020]   but if you have something in mind
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.040]   or you need just a few more points
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.500]   to be able to get to the threshold
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.920]   to book a hotel or a flight, it could make sense.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.960]   On the Chase side, you get 25% bonus
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.900]   to Air France KLM's Flying Blue program.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.020]   That's only through the end of November,
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.940]   but I'm really interested in that
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.220]   because Air France and KLM Flying Blue
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.780]   also just confirmed that they're gonna change
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.060]   their pricing model for award flights,
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.580]   and those changes are gonna result
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.580]   in needing 66% to 71% fewer miles than you needed before.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.580]   So I'll post an article in the show notes
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.260]   if you wanna read more about that,
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.020]   but really cool combo here, transferring to Air France KLM,
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.460]   getting bonus points, and then needing less points
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:57.420]   to book your flight.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.180]   Along the lines of airline program changes,
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.700]   anyone that's a Delta flyer probably already knows this,
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:06.300]   but Delta made a bunch of changes to the negative,
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.100]   then walked back those changes,
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.660]   and in some ways, walked them back so far
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.860]   that the new ability to earn status from credit cards
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.660]   is even better than it was before.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.380]   So there are a lot of changes.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.620]   I won't go into all those details here
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.000]   because if you're a Delta flyer,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.520]   you've probably already read about them.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.000]   I will link to a couple articles in the show notes,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.740]   but I will say one interesting thing
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.260]   is that if you were to get two Delta cards,
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.740]   you'd be able to get Delta Silver status easily next year,
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.780]   and if you were to get all four Delta Platinum,
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.380]   Reserve, Business, and Personal cards,
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.780]   you'd actually get Delta Gold status from those four cards.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.640]   So that's something to keep in mind as well.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.060]   If you really want Delta status,
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.180]   but you're not gonna fly them,
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.620]   though I will say Silver status on Delta
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.880]   is not gonna get you a whole lot more than free check bags,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.380]   which you can get with one credit card anyways.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.260]   Speaking of which, the Delta Platinum card
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.020]   and the Platinum Business card
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:04.340]   is something that right now,
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:05.300]   I never thought I would say
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.540]   'cause we don't fly Delta that much,
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.220]   but it's something that's probably on my list
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.580]   for my next few cards to sign up for,
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.380]   primarily because we have a Delta trip next year,
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.300]   the free check bags is valuable,
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.220]   the Platinum Companion Certificate is pretty interesting.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.140]   You get one companion flight,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:24.300]   and then you also get 15% off all of your award trips.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.020]   So I factored in how many miles I have,
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.260]   what that 15% would be worth.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.140]   It's probably gonna save us close to 200 bucks
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.900]   in check bags as well.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.820]   Plus, depending on the bonus that you are targeted for,
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.180]   you could be looking at anywhere from 50 to 100,000 points.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.900]   So I have links for those.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.960]   There is also a website that I will link to
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.300]   that you might find a better bonus for,
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.840]   but all in all, I think that card
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.000]   is actually pretty decent
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.980]   if you're gonna be traveling for Delta enough,
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.160]   but not enough to meet status.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.040]   There are also a bunch of changes to the Amex Hilton lineup.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.640]   And so with really no notice,
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.840]   they made changes to the Aspire and to the Surpass card.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.300]   The Aspire is actually one of my favorite cards
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:07.420]   because the benefits from the card
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.740]   have historically really outweighed the annual fee.
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.740]   That said, the annual fee is going up.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.020]   They are still a great welcome bonus,
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.580]   but the annual fee went up from 450 to 550.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.900]   And how it's gonna work now
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.860]   is you're gonna get a $200 resort credit
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.300]   at Hilton twice a year.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:27.160]   You're gonna get a $200 flight credit, but $50 a quarter.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.060]   However, in the past, these Amex flight credits
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.940]   have only worked on fees,
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.340]   and these are gonna work on any airline purchase.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.880]   I just used our Hilton Aspire to buy,
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.200]   I think $50 of United Travel Bank credit,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.380]   and that triggered the credit, so that was great.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.580]   You're also gonna get a free night with the card,
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.020]   and then another one at $30,000 a spend,
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.780]   and another one at $60,000.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.740]   And that's a free night at all Hilton properties
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.540]   at their standard rates.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.380]   And then finally,
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.420]   you're gonna get an annual reimbursement of Clear.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.200]   So if you're interested in Clear status,
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.940]   this could kind of combine with that.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.120]   And you also get national executive status for rental cars.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.900]   So it's still becoming a bit of a coupon book
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.140]   to put piece together,
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.020]   but if you stay at a couple Hiltons a year,
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.100]   it would be hard for me to imagine
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.820]   you don't get value from this card.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.300]   And the biggest perk, I forgot to mention,
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.940]   you also get Hilton Diamond status,
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.540]   which is their top tier of status.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.060]   You won't see this card on allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.100]   We don't have any partner links for this card,
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.980]   but my wife's referral link is at allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.340]   So if you're gonna check it out,
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.180]   you can check it out there.
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:33.920]   And right now I think the bonus is 180,000 Hilton points,
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.380]   which is pretty cool.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:40.380]   On the surpass card, annual fee went up from 95 to 150.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.020]   You now get $50 of Hilton credits each quarter.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.820]   So you're gonna need to be staying at Hilton's a lot
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.140]   for that to work,
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.560]   and you lose lounge access,
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.020]   but get national executive status.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.280]   So I still think that if you're gonna be staying
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.980]   at Hilton enough, you'll get more value out of the Aspire,
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.420]   getting the free night and the other credits,
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.280]   but just figured I'd share some of those changes.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.780]   Coming back briefly to the airline conversation,
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.600]   Southwest has made it a little bit easier
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.940]   to get A-list and A-list preferred,
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.860]   which are their two elite statuses,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.300]   which have a few better perks like upgrades and free drinks.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.220]   But the big status that everyone's targeting on Southwest
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.420]   is companion pass.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.220]   And towards the end of the year
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.120]   becomes what I'll call companion pass season.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.100]   And that way it works,
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.220]   and I'll probably link to an article in the show notes
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.140]   'cause I've talked about this a few times,
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.740]   but very high level.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:34.400]   If you get 135,000 rapid rewards points,
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.760]   you're able to get a companion pass with Southwest.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.900]   You get it the year you qualify and the following year,
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.100]   and you can nominate one person.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.620]   You can change it up to three times a year,
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:49.020]   but in that person will fly free for you except for taxes.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.980]   And so the reason why it's so popular to talk about now
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.140]   is that if you were to get two Southwest credit cards
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:59.700]   and wait until January 1st to complete the minimum spend
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.540]   and earn your welcome bonuses,
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.460]   those welcome bonuses will post in January
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:07.400]   or maybe February, you'll earn your companion pass
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.460]   and you'll get it for the entirety of 2024 and 2025.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.900]   And right now all three Chase consumer cards
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.500]   are offering a 75,000 point welcome bonus.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.600]   The business cards are at 60 and 80,000 points.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.900]   So if you have a business,
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.100]   you can get one personal, one business.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.780]   I've done this in the past.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.520]   That'll quickly get you well past your threshold.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.420]   And not only do you get companion pass,
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.080]   but you will have all of those points
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.300]   from those signup bonuses to be able to use on Southwest.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.180]   And companion pass works on points reservations.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.320]   So those two welcome bonuses will get you probably close
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.540]   to $2,000 of Southwest credit in the form of points.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.180]   Southwest program is pretty fixed.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:53.660]   So you get about 1.4 cents per point, no more, no less,
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.580]   within a range sometimes maybe 1.1 to 1.5,
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.620]   but you're never gonna get outsized value.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.300]   So that could be a way to travel almost for free
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   for two years with two signup bonuses,
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.100]   which is something that in the past
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.020]   we've definitely taken advantage of.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.560]   I'll link to a full guide to Southwest companion pass
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.140]   from the Frequent Miler blog, which is really good.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.900]   And last for Southwest people,
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.460]   there's a hack I wanted to share,
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.940]   which is Southwest lowest tier of ticket,
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.980]   the wanna get away fares.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.880]   The one downside to them is that if you cancel your flight,
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:28.140]   that credit you have is only eligible to be used by you.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:30.040]   You can't transfer it to anyone else.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.540]   However, the trick here is you can use that credit
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:38.220]   to buy yourself a ticket on a wanna get away plus fare,
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.740]   and then cancel the wanna get away plus fare
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.400]   and get transferable credit.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.300]   So that's been really handy for a couple of situations
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.400]   for us this year.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.760]   Last, there's one more card that's on my radar
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.360]   for the rest of this year or next year.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.800]   And I've talked about it a lot, it's the built card.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.940]   And if I paid rent, I would absolutely have the card.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.300]   It's the only card out there that earns points on rent.
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.760]   I think you're gonna earn up to 100,000 points a year.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.080]   You earn one X point per dollar on rent.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.620]   You also get three points on travel
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.160]   and two points on dining.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.340]   Not too different from Chase Sapphire preferred reserve.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.740]   So might not help you there.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.660]   But a couple of things that built's been doing
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.820]   that makes me just really want built points
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.900]   is they have a stellar lineup of transfer partners.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.620]   In addition to a lot of the common ones
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.280]   that everyone has, British Airways, Air France, Air Canada,
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.060]   they also have United, which only Chase has,
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.000]   American, which they're the only card
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.020]   that has American as a transfer partner,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.020]   which is a really big standout perk.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.220]   And then they have Hyatt, and they just added Marriott.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.420]   With Marriott, you get the one-to-one transfer,
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.680]   which I don't think is necessarily that compelling.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.540]   But if you do transfer in batches of 20,000 points,
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.180]   you get an extra 5,000 points.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.680]   So it's one to 1.25.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.500]   You do get 100 points for linking your Marriott account
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.020]   as well as all your other accounts.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.380]   So even if you don't have the built card,
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.420]   I think it's worth signing up for a built rewards account.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.720]   Every first of the month, they have rent day
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.540]   and they have games and you can earn points.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:06.100]   And while it might only be 100, 200, 300 here or there,
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.700]   over time, they add up.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.640]   And if you ever do get the built card,
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.220]   you can start stacking those.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.820]   Also on rent day, they've had some crazy, crazy promotions
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.980]   that are really the reason why I'm thinking
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.480]   I need more built points.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.540]   In addition to doubling all your points,
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.280]   meaning you're getting 6X on dining, 4X on travel,
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.820]   and 2X on everything else,
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.800]   they've been offering some transfer bonuses
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.720]   that are unbelievable.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.180]   So they've had ones where not just your standard 25,
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.080]   30% transfer bonus,
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.120]   but they've recently had transfer bonuses
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.120]   as high as 175% bonus, meaning 1.2, 2.75.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.820]   They did a 100% transfer bonus to Air France,
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.420]   which I wish I had the built points to do.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.160]   So those are all really awesome.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.300]   And then last, one really cool perk
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.720]   of just being a built rewards member,
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.160]   which is totally free,
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.600]   is that using the built rewards travel search,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.200]   you can actually search for flights and hotels
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.360]   using Point.me and Aways free of charge.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.800]   So instead of needing to buy a Point.me account,
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.960]   you can use it through the built app.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.840]   It is only limited to built transfer partners,
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.320]   but you get it for free.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.120]   The same thing is also true for Aways,
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.700]   which is an awesome award hotel search site.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.800]   And now that Built has Hyatt, IHG, and Marriott,
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.840]   you can search all three of those on Aways
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.480]   for free through Built.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.880]   So overall, everyone should just go get a Built account
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.320]   for free searching tools and some extra points.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.520]   But if you wanna start earning more built points seriously,
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.400]   I would obviously love it
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.760]   if you wanna use my referral link,
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.000]   which is allthehacks.com/built, B-I-L-T.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   And I'd encourage you once you sign up
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.800]   to share with your friends.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.920]   Okay, last I'm gonna run through five quick things
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.360]   with the one that's gonna save me the most at the end,
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.560]   which is really awesome.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.840]   So first, I never knew this,
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.440]   but Odessa emailed in to let me know
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.720]   that a lot of local libraries have museum passes.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.240]   And so sure enough, I looked up our local library
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240]   and they have a partnership
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.600]   with a program called Discover & Go
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.120]   that has free passes you can check out
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.280]   and borrow virtually to really great museums.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.040]   So California Academy of Sciences, SFX,
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.920]   the San Francisco Exploratorium.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.840]   So definitely make sure you go look
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.600]   at whether you can get access to local museums
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.120]   from your library.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.600]   If you have an Amex Platinum right now,
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.280]   you might've known that you get access
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.000]   to Walmart Plus for free.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.440]   We don't really ever shop at Walmart,
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.920]   so I never really activated it,
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.200]   but Walmart Plus has a partnership with Paramount Plus.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.000]   So with a Walmart Plus membership,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.600]   you get Paramount Plus free.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.320]   So if you do have an Amex Platinum,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.960]   you can go through that double link
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.760]   and get free Paramount Plus,
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.600]   which is interesting.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.480]   They're not a partner of the digital entertainment credit
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.920]   that Amex provides.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.800]   But I will say if you do have an Amex Platinum
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.000]   and you are using your digital entertainment credit,
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.880]   which gets you $20 a month on New York Times,
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.840]   Sirius XM, Wall Street Journal.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.320]   I noticed my New York Times subscription went from,
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.800]   I think it was like $18 every four weeks to 25.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.520]   And I went online and said, "No, that's too much."
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.920]   And they said, "Well, what if it was $4 every four weeks?"
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.280]   And I was like, "Well, I'll take $4."
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.040]   So that's one way to kind of lower that.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.640]   I will say that I don't know if you have access
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.320]   to all the online cancellation options
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.840]   on the New York Times website,
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.880]   unless you live in California.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.040]   So I would say either VPN to California, if you have a VPN,
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.720]   or ask a friend in California to do it for you.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.000]   Otherwise you might have to do a phone call or a live chat.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.760]   There's some law that requires you
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.680]   to be able to cancel subscriptions online in California
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.160]   that doesn't apply everywhere.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.120]   That might've changed, but at least a couple of years ago,
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.040]   that was true.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.040]   So one app I've been loving lately is called DaisyDisk.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.960]   If you have a Mac and you wanna just figure out
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.520]   what's using all your hard drive space,
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.920]   it's really great and better
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.160]   than all the other ones I've tried.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.360]   It even supports Dropbox and Google Drive
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.240]   to analyze where your space is going there.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.320]   And then last is a site I'm really excited about
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.960]   called OwnWell.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.600]   The way this works is in a lot of states,
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.360]   you can appeal your property appraisal
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.240]   and therefore lower your property tax.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.640]   I didn't realize how possible this was.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.960]   For people who live in Texas,
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.160]   I guess you get a lot of mail about this.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.000]   In California, you don't.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.480]   But I got connected with the founder of this company
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.360]   because one of his investors
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.400]   is one of the investors of my last company.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.560]   And effectively, they go out and do all the work
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.880]   to create the comps and the data and the backend,
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.560]   file with the county or whatever the regulatory body is.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.400]   And if it gets to a hearing,
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.200]   we'll represent you at the hearing
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.960]   to help push for lower property appraisals.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.160]   So I went through this entire process with them
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.840]   and the amount we're pushing for on our property
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.160]   is about 17% lower than what we're currently at,
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.240]   which would save us meaningful amounts of money every year.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.640]   And thanks to Prop 13 in California,
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.040]   if you do this once, it'll go on forever.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.880]   They also operate in Georgia, Texas, Florida,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.680]   and parts of New York, Illinois, and Washington.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.280]   The service is free,
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.160]   but any amount of money that they save you
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.000]   on your property tax,
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.560]   they take 25% of for that first year.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.840]   So you can go through this entire process yourself.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.680]   I started doing it just to try to understand it.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.560]   And then I realized the number of hours
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.160]   I was gonna spend to go build these models
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.080]   and do them in the very specific way
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.920]   that the county requires,
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.040]   which isn't always published, is just too much work.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.280]   So big fan of them.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.200]   I actually asked him if he could do anything
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.680]   for our listeners,
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.600]   and he offered to put $25 off
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.680]   any of the services anyone uses.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:44.680]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/ownwell,
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.320]   O-W-N-W-E-L-L, you could sign up and get that deal.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.480]   Wow. Okay, that's it.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.760]   I was long overdue for one of these episodes.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.280]   I really hope it was valuable.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.360]   I love doing them,
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.320]   and I'm gonna start trying to do them a bit more regularly.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.880]   Keep questions coming,
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.840]   keep your tips, hacks, and wins coming.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.160]   All of those can come to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.360]   And two more things.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.320]   First, if you have a few minutes this week,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.760]   I would greatly appreciate it
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.560]   if you could fill out the All The Hacks survey.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.440]   It would mean so much to me.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.720]   You can do that at allthehacks.com/survey
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.200]   or the link in the show notes.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.120]   And I will keep you guys posted by email
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   if you are the winner of a $100 Viore gift card
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.960]   on any Day Essentials cookware set
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.240]   or a free ticket on United.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.720]   Second, as for the giveaway I mentioned earlier,
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.840]   if you haven't already seen the trailer,
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.160]   there is a new movie out called "Dumb Money,"
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.320]   which I'm really excited to watch.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.080]   The movie chronicles the meme stock craziness back in 2021,
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.720]   and specifically the GameStop short squeeze
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.200]   and the journey of Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.040]   It's got an 84/85 on Rotten Tomatoes,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.960]   and the cast includes Pete Davidson,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.760]   Seth Rogen, Nick Offerman, Shailene Woodley,
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.840]   and a bunch more.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.160]   If you wanna check it out,
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.800]   I have 20 free download codes for you all.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.640]   I'm gonna put them up at allthehacks.com/dumbmoney.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.040]   And if you go to that URL
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.720]   and it ends up redirecting you to the All The Hacks survey,
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.960]   then you'll know they've already been claimed.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.800]   Also, just for full transparency,
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.360]   the PR firm for the movie didn't pay me to talk about this,
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.960]   but the movie actually looked really good,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.560]   and they offered 20 free download codes for listeners,
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.840]   so I figured it'd be worth sharing with all of you.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.760]   Okay, thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.800]   That's all for this week.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.000]   I will see you next week.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
