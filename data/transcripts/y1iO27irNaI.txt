[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   We are considering at the moment the words found in Paul's epistle to the Romans in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.960]   chapter 10, verses 14 to 17.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.440]   "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.760]   And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.400]   And how shall they hear without a preacher?
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.000]   And how shall they preach except they be sent, as it is written?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.560]   How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.520]   of good things.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.080]   But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.800]   For as I a said Lord who hath believed our report, so then faith cometh by hearing and
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.600]   hearing by the word of God."
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.760]   Now we are examining at the moment, you remember, verses 14 and 15, where the apostle shows
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.200]   us how the message of salvation becomes known to mankind.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.640]   Here is what I have called the general call of the gospel.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.040]   And his argument is that God's way of making this message known or extending this call
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.000]   is through preaching.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.840]   And that to that end he calls and sends men to preach this message of salvation.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.600]   Now having considered therefore the calling and the sending of the preacher, we have started
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.080]   considering the message of the preacher.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:39.680]   The message that is heralded and proclaimed by these men whom God sends in this way.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   And we began our consideration of the message last Friday night by saying that the message
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.880]   obviously is about him.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600]   And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.080]   Therefore obviously the message of the preacher is a message about him.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   And I indicated there that it means that it is a message primarily always about the Lord
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.680]   Jesus Christ, as to his person and as to the facts concerning him.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.120]   That of course is what you get recorded in the gospels.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.000]   That is why the gospels come first in the New Testament.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.040]   This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, says Matthew.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.600]   They all say something similar.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.440]   And they start by telling us who he is and then they give us these vital, crucial facts
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.880]   in connection with him.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.960]   And I do want again to underline this question of the facts.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   His birth, the manner of his birth, the way he was born, his teaching, his miracles, his
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   death, his burial, his resurrection, his manifestation of himself, his ascension, his being seated
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.960]   at the right hand of the power of God in the glory everlasting.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.360]   Now the whole of the Christian message depends upon these facts.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.200]   You may wonder why I keep on saying this.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.280]   Well I've only one answer to give.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   I've got to go on repeating this because people are saying the exact opposite.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.120]   And because they will forget the facts and because they divorce the Christian message
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   from the facts altogether.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.160]   There is a Christianity being currently taught which rarely denies the facts almost entirely.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.120]   I've reminded you more than once that one of the most popular, if not the most popular,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.960]   theology today on the continent of Europe, taught mainly by a man of the name of Bultman,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.240]   is one which rarely dismisses most of the facts.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   Virtually Bultman says there's only one fact we can be certain of and that is that
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.320]   Jesus died on a cross and we can't be sure of anything else.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.840]   But still he claims that he's teaching all this in the interest of the Christian message.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.640]   You see that is the tragedy, that men will divide the message from the person and the
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.360]   facts concerning him.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.720]   And that to me is to deny the whole of the gospel.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.680]   For this is a message that is based solidly upon and deduced entirely from the facts in
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.640]   connection with this person.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.840]   But now we shall be able, as we proceed this evening, to make that perhaps still more clear.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.120]   But there it is, it obviously starts with him, that's the whole point of the Apostle's
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120]   argument.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.920]   But now let's go take a step further forward and ask what are the general characteristics
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.360]   of the message concerning him.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's all about him, well now what are the general characteristics of the message concerning
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   him?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And here the Apostle answers that question by his quotation from Isaiah 52 7.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.960]   How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.160]   of good things.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.120]   We saw last Friday night that there probably is an interpolation there and that it should
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.740]   read like this.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:12.200]   How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.080]   Now then that gives us the key to the general characteristic of this gospel message.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   What is it?
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.160]   Well it is that it's glad tidings.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.680]   You see he quotes Isaiah because the prophet had been given this preview and he saw that
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   was the thing.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.920]   And he's very imaginal, suggests it as I pointed out to you.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.240]   Here are people in bondage and in captivity and they can't do anything about themselves
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.160]   but they're waiting for a deliverer to come.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.040]   They're always looking to the hills surrounding them.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.880]   At last they see the messenger coming and the excitement, the glad tidings, the feet
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   of this man.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.640]   His very feet are a joy to them because they know that he's the bearer of glad tidings.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.320]   Now I want to show the importance of this aspect of the gospel.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.360]   The word used by the apostle here in his translation of Isaiah 52-7 is that word essentially that
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.440]   we found in Acts 8-4 you remember.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.360]   Where we are told that the people who were scattered abroad from Jerusalem, the early
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.320]   Christians scattered abroad by the persecution, they went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.520]   Not the word that's used about Philip when he goes down to Samaria but this other word.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.840]   Well that's the word here because the apostle is anxious to bring out this element of good
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   news, this element of glad tidings.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.880]   It's the announcing of good news.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:49.680]   And what I'm trying to emphasize at the moment is this, that the one test which we
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.360]   must always apply to the preaching of the gospel, once we've applied the main test
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.200]   about the person and the facts concerning him, the moment you've done that, then the
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.160]   test to apply is this.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.680]   Is this good news?
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.320]   Is this glad tidings?
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.720]   It's a most wonderful test this.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.820]   And you will find that it will never fail you.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.680]   And it will help you to discriminate when you're listening to a sermon or when you're
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.800]   reading a sermon between what is true and what is false.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.440]   It's the most wonderful test, this.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.680]   The gospel must always be glad tidings, good news.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.560]   Now it was never perhaps more important then that we should be aware of this particular
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.440]   test than just at this present time.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.780]   And that is why I'm going to stay with it for a while this evening.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.640]   The state of the country demands this.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.080]   The state of society, the moral condition of this country and of the whole world demands
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.800]   that we should be absolutely certain as to what the gospel message really is.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.180]   Because there is nothing that can deal with the situation apart from the gospel.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.440]   Everything else has been tried, everything else is failing before our eyes.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.760]   We can't go on repeating that too often.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.000]   This is perhaps in many ways the most educated, cultured century that the world has ever known.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.780]   And yet here we are with this problem staring us in the face in a most terrible form.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.280]   The only hope is the gospel.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.400]   Well, very well then, that makes it doubly important that we should know what the gospel
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.220]   is.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.100]   The state of the world, the state of the country, the state of society demands this.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.160]   But the state of the church also demands it.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.560]   Why is the Christian church so ineffective?
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.080]   Why is it that only 10% of people go to a place of worship?
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.800]   Why is it that the Christian church counts for so little in this country?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.840]   Now many answers are being given to that question.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.080]   For myself I have only one answer to give to the question.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.920]   I believe that the state of the churches is to be explained by one thing only and that
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.840]   is that the message of the gospel is not being preached and hasn't been preached for a number
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.040]   of years.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.440]   I believe that the people were more or less driven out of the churches by false gospel,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.060]   by false preaching.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.440]   And that is why all this is so important and that we must be clear concerning it.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:40.640]   Now let me say this, there is nothing that I dislike so much as having to be controversial.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.840]   Nothing would give me greater pleasure than just to be able to give you a positive exposition
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.560]   Friday by Friday and nothing else.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.160]   But my dear friends I have no choice in this matter.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.440]   The apostle tells us that we are set for the defense as well as the propagation of the
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.120]   gospel.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.560]   And if you see the moral state of the world and if you see the state of the church, well
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.960]   then it behoves you to discover the cause of the troubles and to correct it.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.560]   I would to God that I hadn't got to do these things.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:18.760]   But I would regard myself as a very poor teacher if I didn't warn you against error, if I
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.400]   didn't show you how to detect the error and how to differentiate between the true and
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.560]   the false.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.440]   The gospel is to be applied.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.160]   And the tragedy is today that Christian people don't seem to have any sense of discrimination
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   any longer.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.420]   They judge by men's appearance.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.680]   They look at men like the late Pope and the wireless and they say, "Looks a nice man
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.120]   and he seems so pleasant, therefore he must be right."
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.840]   Well now, there's only one thing to do with a condition like that and that is to instruct.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.400]   It is children who are carried away by every wind of doctrine.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:58.240]   It is children who can be taken in by a kind, nice, plausible man as it were.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   And therefore the only antidote is teaching and instruction.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.720]   We can't afford to be sentimental my friends.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.260]   We are living in a momentous age.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.360]   The whole future of morals in this country depends upon these matters.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.020]   And indeed even beyond that, the whole state of the Christian church really depends upon
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.280]   our understanding the nature of this message.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.100]   Now here I say the apostle at once gives us a general test.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.360]   Whatever else the gospel is, it is glad-tidings.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   It is good news.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.760]   Here's the comparison.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:44.200]   How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad-tidings of great joy.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.400]   Did some of you think that I'd suddenly gone mad and I'd given out two Christmas
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.800]   hymns before Good Friday and Easter?
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.000]   Not at all.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   It was done deliberately in order to introduce this very theme.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.340]   And why shouldn't we sing these hymns all round the year?
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.560]   Why should we leave them only to that particular time of the year?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.200]   The gospel in its fullness should be constantly in our minds.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.640]   Very well then, I say, here's the test, glad-tidings, good news.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.520]   Now then, this is so important that I've got to give you some negatives.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.320]   Let us then in the light of this definition, which tells us that it's glad-tidings,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.800]   see what the gospel is not.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.860]   It's very important that we should know what is not gospel.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.000]   The mere fact that a man gets up in a pulpit which is called Christian and preaches does
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.440]   not mean that he's preaching the gospel.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.760]   This thing is really almost too pathetic for words.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.040]   People seem to think today that the way in which you define an evangelist is this.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.400]   He's a man who speaks in the open air.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.060]   If a man preaches in the open air, he must be an evangelist.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.200]   It isn't where a man preaches that decides whether he's an evangelist, it's what
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   he preaches.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.760]   And a man can preach a lie in the open air as easily as he can in a church building.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.880]   But that is the kind of loose, sentimental way in which people think today.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.960]   Now then, I say negatively, first of all, that the message of the Christian gospel is
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   not merely a message about morality and ethics.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.000]   I start with that because that's the commonest misconception of all.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.520]   It's a very old one, of course.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.400]   There's nothing new about it, but it is very popular at the present time.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   It was popularized mainly in the last century by the famous Dr. Thomas Arnold, the head
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.040]   master of rugby.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.880]   He was the man who gave this particular emphasis its greatest currency.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.000]   His idea of Christianity was that it was that which produced good little gentlemen.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.480]   It's that which makes a man a gentleman.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.160]   So his message was one purely of morals and of ethics.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.440]   And there are large numbers of people who think today that that is the Christian message.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.720]   It's a message to tell us to live a good life and to encourage us to do so.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.840]   You get your little homilies or addresses just to urge us to be good and to help one
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.120]   another and so on.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.360]   Now, all I'm saying is this, that that cannot be the gospel for this reason.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.600]   Where is the element of glad tidings in it?
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.520]   If I came here and simply, Sunday by Sunday and Friday by Friday, urged you not to drink
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.480]   and not to smoke and not to do this, that and the other, and stopped at that, where
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.760]   would the glad tidings come in?
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.040]   You see, that's the way you test.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.200]   There must be the element of glad tidings, good news.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.520]   And if it's merely moral, ethical teaching, there is no glad tidings at all.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.160]   So that cannot be the gospel.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.040]   And it isn't the gospel.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.480]   That's going back under the law.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.360]   That's the very thing Paul is denouncing in the whole of this epistle, and particularly
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.520]   at this point in this 10th chapter.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.640]   It is almost incredible that anybody could ever enter into this confusion.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   But that's where the devil comes in, you see.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.800]   He robs the gospel of its glory, he turns it into nothing but a new kind of law.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.200]   And so it is no longer the gospel.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.680]   Or another way, and I'm being as practical as I can in order to help, help you to discriminate
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.520]   at this present time.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.800]   Other people seem to think that the main business of preaching is just to answer people's
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:27.920]   questions, and to help them to live as the result of answering their questions.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.280]   Now, I think you'll find that this is becoming increasingly popular.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.040]   People are saying the days of preaching are gone.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.400]   And it's no use preaching to people.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.840]   The thing you must do now is get the people to bring their questions, and you answer the
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   questions.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.520]   And that is regarded as preaching at the present time.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.560]   Now, I want to give you an example of this which came to my notice actually during this
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   past week.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.360]   It suits it so perfectly that I'm going to read it to you.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   Here was an interview in a religious paper with a well-known preacher, at least a preacher
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:08.800]   in inverted commas in this country, on the subject, "Can Christianity survive?"
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   That's the question.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   Can Christianity survive?
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.400]   So an interview took place.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.440]   And the man being interviewed said that he, during recent years, I visited many parts
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.960]   of the world, and I've made a point of trying to discover the reasons why the masses of
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.360]   the people are indifferent to the Christian church.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.360]   That's the question.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360]   Can Christianity survive?
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   The churches are failing.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.360]   Why are they failing?
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.320]   Now, this is his answer.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:42.840]   Almost unanimously, there has come the criticism that what the churches say has no bearing
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:50.680]   upon the kind of lives which ordinary people lead, and the problems which they encounter.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.760]   That's the trouble, he says.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.640]   Then says the interviewer, I asked him for an example.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.960]   Here is his reply.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.200]   Well, he said, one example is sex.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.320]   And all the higher critics now will know who the famous preacher is.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.640]   Sex, you see.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.240]   Here's the thing, Oliver.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.320]   Well, he said, one example is sex.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.240]   One of life's most important activities, and yet many people are bewildered by it.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.840]   But if a person is troubled by a sexual problem, it is unlikely that you will help him by telling
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.200]   him to seek guidance from the church.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.440]   The subject of sex is hardly ever dealt with from the pulpit.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.000]   The church is out of touch with people.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   You see the idea?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.360]   Well, then he goes on to say this.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.880]   When he was a minister, he's now retired, and sex was very prominent, as you gather
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.760]   in his ministry, and rarely accounted for its popularity.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.240]   He then says when he was a minister, one experiment which achieved some success was that part
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.080]   of some Sunday evening services was devoted to a question time.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.600]   The congregation were invited to write down any question that they wanted to ask, and
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   the slips of paper bearing their questions were collected and brought up to me in the
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   pulpit.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.440]   In this way, I found out the kind of things which were troubling people, and by basing
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.480]   subsequent sermons on those issues, I felt that I was saying something relevant.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.600]   That's his conception of preaching.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.280]   He hasn't been given a message by the risen Lord.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   He isn't a herald of good news.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   He's got to find out from the people what he's to preach about.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   What is preaching?
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.360]   Oh, it's nothing but answering people's questions.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.080]   Now that is not glad tiding.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.480]   Here is a man who was not sent as a herald, and you see him coming across the mountains
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   with this tremendous thing to announce.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.200]   No, he's got to ask for questions, and Christianity is nothing but an answer, a particular answer,
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.040]   to the questions that you ask, particularly these problems like sex and so on.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.440]   These are the things people are interested in, so your message is what they're interested
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   in.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.120]   You don't go to them and tell them what they ought to be interested in.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.800]   No, you start with them.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.480]   The pew determines the message of the pulpit, and there you are just answering questions.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.440]   Now that is, I say, a complete travesty of what is conveyed to us here by the apostle
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.520]   at this point in his teaching.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.400]   Now there's then the second misconception.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   It isn't just answering questions.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:27.000]   Thirdly, it isn't a series of discourses on political and social matters.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.440]   It isn't the enunciation of a kind of political or social program to improve the world.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.760]   I needn't stay with this, but this is very common, as you know, again.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.760]   They always talk, these people, about the kingdom of God.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.600]   Their teaching is entirely removed from the New Testament, but that's what they're always
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.960]   talking about, that the business of Christians is to bring in the kingdom of God.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.400]   And you do that by taking an active part in politics and in social matters.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.320]   And you must urge people to improve and to reform and so on, and you enter into it with
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   them.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   Now there was a great example of this.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.280]   I happened to be on holiday a few years back and was listening to a broadcast sermon on
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.360]   the wireless, and I heard a very well-known preacher, who was once the moderator of his
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.400]   church in a given part of the British Isles, saying this quite deliberately.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.760]   He said, "Missionaries must get rid of this notion that their business is to go and what
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   they call 'preach the gospel to people'."
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   He said, "That isn't the thing to do."
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.240]   He was talking in particular of Africa.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.080]   He said, "This is what you've got to do, you missionaries.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.680]   You've got to go and live amongst those people.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.280]   You've got to enter into their politics.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.080]   You've got to share their problems with them and live the Christian life amongst them,
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.480]   especially in this political, social environment.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.040]   And if you do that," he said, "there may be some hope that the grandchildren of the
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.600]   people with whom you are living now may become Christian."
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:04.280]   Now that was said by the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.680]   a few years back.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.040]   And that is regarded as the way of propagating the Christian message.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.000]   And of course we are familiar with others in this country who teach a similar kind of
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.600]   teaching, just political, social and nothing else.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.520]   Now all I'm asking is where's the glad tidings, where's the good news?
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   It just isn't there.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.440]   It isn't there at all.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.880]   Then another one, the fourth which I would mention is this.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:42.680]   The idea that the message of Christian preaching is to urge people to imitate the Lord Jesus
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   Christ.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:49.160]   Now let me come back again to this interview which deals with the subject of can Christianity
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   survive.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.160]   Now listen to this.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:57.800]   "Christianity to me," says this man, "is a way of life.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   A Christian is someone who believes that Christ's way is the supreme way of life, who tries
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.840]   to follow it and who tries to respond to the demands of life in a Christ-like spirit."
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.360]   That's his idea of Christianity.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.200]   "It is utterly wrong to tell a man that he cannot be a Christian unless he declares
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.640]   unconditional assent to a set list of theological propositions."
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.080]   You see this man in a public interview published in a religious paper is denying and attacking
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.920]   what I'm trying to tell you Friday by Friday.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.400]   That's why I'm driven to reply to it.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.120]   He says it is utterly wrong to tell a man that he cannot be a Christian unless he declares
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.480]   unconditional assent to a set list of theological propositions.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.280]   In the course of a recent television interview between Malcolm Muggeridge and a distinguished
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.240]   ecclesiastic, Muggeridge said that he was greatly attracted to much of Christ's teaching,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.800]   although he had reservations about, amongst other things, the virgin birth.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:02.840]   Muggeridge then asked this ecclesiastic where in view of these reservations he stood, to
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.400]   which came the reply that he was out.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:13.360]   "Jesus would never have said that," says the man being interviewed.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.560]   I asked him, says the interviewer, to elaborate on this line of thought, and here's the result.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.400]   "Well, Jesus never demanded intellectual assent to a statement of doctrine.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.560]   It is quite alien to the spirit of Jesus to tell anyone that such relatively unimportant
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.920]   matters as the virgin birth should stand between a person and his coming to Christ.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.840]   There must be thousands of thoughtful men and women, I've met some myself, who are
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.720]   put off the Church because they cannot subscribe to some of the so-called fundamentals of its
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   theology.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.040]   Take the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.880]   How can you believe that it expresses all the fullness of God, the infinite creator
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.240]   of all things?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.040]   How can you put into a creedal tape measure, how can you put a creedal tape measure around
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   his august being?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.760]   Another lover of Jodrell Banks says he thinks it likely that other planets are inhabited.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:13.240]   How then can I honestly repeat the creed which speaks of the only begotten Son of God?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:20.440]   How do I know that far from three persons in one, there may not be three thousand or
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.320]   three million in one?"
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.720]   Now this is, you see, the thing that is so popular today.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.760]   Then he was asked another thing, whether he thought that the people outside the Churches
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.960]   had a wrong mental picture of God, and here's the answer.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.560]   They can hardly fail to have when so many churchgoers seem to have.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.280]   Can you blame people for not wanting to worship a God who is supposed to give people cancer
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   or whose subjects to eternal torture those who during their earthly lives have rejected
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   him?
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.360]   God is mirrored in Jesus.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.060]   Indeed, the Master said so.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:01.160]   Nothing can be true about God if it obviously conflicts with the Spirit of Jesus, not even
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.520]   if it's in the Bible.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.960]   We must judge the Bible by Jesus, not the reverse.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.440]   Now I don't want to wear you or waste your time, but I put all that before you to show
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.760]   you how essential it is that we should work out these statements of the great apostle.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.360]   You noticed the incredible muddle in that last statement.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.880]   Here is a man who's not going to believe anything even though the Bible says it, if it's in
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.600]   conflict with the Spirit of Jesus.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.360]   But what does he know about Jesus apart from what he finds in the Bible?
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.720]   Nothing at all.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   Nothing at all.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.000]   He knows nothing about Jesus except what he finds in the Bible, and yet he's going to
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.200]   judge the Bible by the Spirit of Jesus.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.160]   In other words, it comes to this.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.380]   It's what he thinks that matters, neither the Bible nor Jesus.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.880]   But you see, my friends, this is the position at which we've arrived, and I don't hesitate
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.540]   to say that is why the churches are as they are.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.800]   It's very difficult, isn't it?
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.040]   But I've been criticized in the past for not belonging to the same union as this man.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.180]   How can I belong to the same union as such a man?
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.880]   This is a lie.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.880]   This is anti-Christ.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.760]   And though I were alone, I would never join with such a man, nor have anything to do with
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.800]   an association of churches that can tolerate such a man.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.520]   This is a denial of the Christian message.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.800]   Not only is there no good news in it, it goes out of its way to attack the good news and
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.200]   attempt to make fun of it and to pour scorn and ridicule upon it.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   Very well.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.120]   All that talk about the imitation of Christ.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.200]   This is the best teaching.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.920]   I try to put it into practice, and so on.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   Sentimental.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.200]   Very well, let me take another.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.800]   What is this message that the preacher is to preach?
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:00.080]   Well, it isn't either, and we are going up the scale, intellectually itinerate we are
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.320]   going up the scale.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.160]   It isn't merely a philosophical view of life and of Christ.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.440]   Now I've got to put this again before you.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:16.280]   All misconceptions of the gospel are not as crude and as unintelligent as the one I've
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.920]   just been reading to you.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.760]   That sheer sentimentality and psychology and sex and so on.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   Very popular, of course, with a certain type of person.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.180]   But now, there are other people who, of course, are too intelligent and too intellectual to
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.040]   believe that kind of thing, but can be equally wrong.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.480]   And they so intellectualize the gospel that it is no longer the message.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:46.000]   Now let me read to you a review, a portion of a review itinerate, of a book recently
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.480]   published under the title, "The Secular Meaning of the Gospel."
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.400]   And this is how it's put.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.080]   The author then tackles the Easter event.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   Now this is appropriate.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.040]   Easter Sunday is coming.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:06.680]   The author then tackles the Easter event and concludes, then he quotes from the author,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:15.000]   "Jesus of Nazareth was a free man in his own life, who attracted followers and created
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.960]   enemies according to the dynamics of personality, and in a manner comparable to the effect of
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.200]   other liberated persons in history upon people about them.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:34.440]   He died as a result of the threat that such a free man poses for insecure and bound men.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.280]   His disciples were left no less insecure and frightened.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:48.480]   Two days later, Peter and then other disciples had an experience of which Jesus was the sense
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.400]   content.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:59.120]   They experienced a discernment situation in which Jesus, the free man whom they had known
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.960]   themselves, and indeed the whole world, were seen in a quite new way.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.840]   From that moment, the disciples began to possess something of the freedom of Jesus.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   His freedom began to be contagious."
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.360]   That's the resurrection, my friends.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.740]   That's the resurrection for you.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.640]   And so he ends up by saying that mission, the business, the mission of the church, is
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:37.440]   not the conversion of unbelievers, but the practice by Christians of Jesus' contagious
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.840]   liberty.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.080]   You see the idea?
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.000]   That Peter and then the other disciples had some sort of an experience.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.960]   It's not the literal rising of the Lord Jesus Christ in the body from the grave.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:57.660]   They had some sort of an experience of which Jesus was the sense content.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:04.320]   They had some feeling of exaltation, and it came to them in terms of the person of Jesus.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:11.800]   They experienced a discernment situation in which Jesus, the free man whom they had known
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.320]   themselves, and indeed the whole world, were seen in quite a new way.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.160]   From that moment, the disciples began to possess something of the freedom of Jesus.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.360]   His freedom began to be contagious.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:33.840]   Well, all I'm saying is that if that is gospel, I have no idea what the gospel is,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.980]   and I shouldn't be standing in a pulpit.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.720]   But let me come to the last of the misconceptions.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:46.000]   Or if you prefer it, let me give you the sixth negative as to what the content of the message
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.920]   is not.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.660]   And it is not the message of Roman Catholicism.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.660]   What I mean is this.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.600]   I'm not going to go into Roman Catholicism, but the essential message of Roman Catholicism
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   is this.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.800]   Believe in the Church and her teaching.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.320]   It will include teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, I know, and many other things that
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   are right.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:15.800]   But the essential teaching is, believe in the Church and her teaching, and submit yourself
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   to it.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   That is their essential message.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.160]   And I'm putting it down amongst these negatives.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   Why?
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   I'm putting these six negatives before you.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.160]   Here's my answer.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.480]   They're not true to the New Testament teaching.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.720]   You don't find any of them in the New Testament.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:40.440]   Secondly, none of them can be gospel because they leave it all to us.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.840]   They're all telling us to do something, to live a good life.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.360]   Or they're helping me to live the good life and asking me to ask my questions in order
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.500]   that they can help me.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.480]   But still I've got to put it into practice.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.920]   When I put my question to the great preacher and he answers, I've still got to do it.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   He doesn't believe in anything else.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.980]   Everything is natural and it's left to me.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.120]   And so on with all.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.460]   They all leave it to me.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.160]   But this is my main reason for rejecting them all.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.440]   Where are the glad tidings?
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.780]   Where's the element of good news?
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:19.020]   Where's the notion of a preacher being sent to herald and to proclaim, running across
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.360]   the mountaintops and the people seeing him?
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.840]   Where's that element?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   It's absent.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.880]   Take that last quotation that I've read to you.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.140]   Did you understand it?
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.140]   I don't think you did.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.980]   I don't blame you for not.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.380]   But where are the glad tidings?
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.920]   What is this sense content of Jesus?
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.960]   What's it mean?
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.800]   What is the resurrection?
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.340]   Now you see, these things have got to be rejected for that reason.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.320]   So let me leave those negatives and come to the positive.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   What is the essence?
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.360]   What is the main chief characteristic of the message of the preacher of the gospel?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.840]   I say once more, it is good news.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.880]   Listen, my dear friends, having listened to those quotations I've put before you, listen
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.720]   to what I read about the preaching of the Son of God himself.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.360]   The common people heard him gladly.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.680]   What do the common people know about this sense content and about this freedom of Jesus
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.580]   becoming contagious?
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.960]   This odd, strange experience which these disciples had.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.360]   Two days later, Peter and then the other disciples had an experience of which Jesus was the sense
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   content.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.040]   The whole genius of Christianity is the common people heard him gladly.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.960]   And the common people can't hear this sort of thing.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.420]   They don't know what it means.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.160]   These men themselves don't know what it means.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.720]   It's words, it's verbiage.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.800]   It's all so involved philosophically that it's almost impossible to understand what
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.400]   some of them are trying to say.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.440]   The common people heard him gladly.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.960]   And if the common people can't hear gladly the message of the preacher, he is not a preacher
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.320]   sent by God.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.240]   He is not a preacher of the gospel.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.800]   Or take the other word of our Lord.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.680]   When John sent his two disciples asking the famous question, "Art thou he that should
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.480]   come or do we look for another?"
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.560]   Do you remember our Lord's answer?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.560]   The blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:30.000]   made to hear, the dead are raised and finally, climax if you like, unto the poor.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.640]   The gospel is preached.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:37.080]   This is the differential of the Christian gospel.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.840]   You see, our Lord is contesting it there with Greek philosophy.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.800]   The Greeks, the Greek philosophers have got nothing to give to the poor.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   Nothing at all.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.160]   The poor were barbarians and they called them barbarians.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.680]   They divided the world into Greeks and barbarians.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.760]   And the barbarians, the poor, the illiterate, they've got nothing to say to them.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   Why?
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.240]   Well, because they didn't understand their categories.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.520]   They couldn't enter into their great involved arguments and these great thoughts, they couldn't
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   follow.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.400]   The poor were utterly neglected.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.160]   Nobody had anything to say to them.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.720]   But when he comes, he says, "Go and tell John this is what we've been seeing."
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.120]   And above everything, "Unto the poor is the gospel preached."
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.120]   The poor.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.960]   That's his emphasis.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.720]   And the apostle, of course, takes up the same statement when he writes to the Corinthians
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.680]   dealing with this very point.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.560]   And he puts it like this, you remember, at the end of 1 Corinthians 1.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.640]   You see, "You are calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.120]   many mighty, not many noble have called.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.000]   But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.040]   And God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.960]   and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.480]   Yea, and things which are not to bring to naught the things that are, that no flesh
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.120]   should glory in his presence."
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.400]   That's it.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.320]   The poor can understand this.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.960]   This is a message to all.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.640]   This is a message even to the ignorant and the unenlightened.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:13.040]   And so, when you read the beginning of the Gospels about how the good news has come into
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.960]   the world, you find the first man, in a sense, who really put it all in a nutshell, was old
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.200]   Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.320]   He had been pretty dull and pretty slow, but now, you see, he's inspired, the Holy Spirit
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.120]   has enlightened him, and he cries out and he says, "God hath visited and redeemed his
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   people."
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:42.520]   None of your abstruse philosophy, none of your trying to understand the spirit of Jesus
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.920]   or the exhortations to men and women to do this, "God hath visited and redeemed his
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   people."
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   Here's the message.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.640]   Here's the content.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.840]   Or take it as we had it in the reading at the beginning.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:03.480]   The message of the angels to those poor, ignorant, illiterate shepherds watching their flocks
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   by night.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:12.400]   "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:21.000]   For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord."
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.240]   And then you remember the angelic host bursting forth, "Glory to God in the highest and on
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.640]   earth peace, goodwill toward men."
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.760]   And the shepherds, we are told, went back rejoicing in their hearts.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.840]   They've heard the good news, they've found their confirmation, and they're filled with
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.600]   a spirit of joy and of exultation.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.720]   You get exactly the same thing in the message of John the Baptist.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:52.560]   Immediately before the beginning of our Lord's own ministry, John says, "I'm nothing," he
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.880]   says, "but a voice crying in the wilderness."
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.240]   What's he crying?
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.480]   Well, he tells us what he's crying.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.440]   "Prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.480]   He is about to come."
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.100]   He's quoting Isaiah 40.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.240]   He says, "I'm nothing but the forerunner.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.320]   Make his paths straight.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.680]   Every valley shall be filled, every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.280]   shall be made straight, and the rough way shall be made smooth, and all flesh shall
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.640]   see the salvation of God.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.320]   It's come over the mountaintops.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   It's arrived.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.480]   Here's this tremendous thing.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.920]   Listen," says John, "I'm merely the announcer.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.360]   I'm a voice crying in the wilderness, making a proclamation."
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.960]   That's the character of the gospel.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.400]   In other words, you see, the essence of this message is this.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.960]   It is glad tidings.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Why?
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.560]   Because it isn't a call to us to do anything.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.760]   It is a proclamation and an announcement to us of what God has done about us men and our
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.520]   salvation.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.980]   And that is the gospel.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.040]   That is the message of the preacher.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.120]   What God has done.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.880]   Nor men could do it.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.520]   What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.800]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.760]   the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.240]   the flesh but after the Spirit.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.320]   Romans 8, 3 and 4.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.840]   Here it is, you see.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.200]   What God has done.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:25.040]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.520]   the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.520]   It's God.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.680]   God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.760]   This is the great characteristic of the message.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.080]   And you don't find it in these false gospels.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.200]   There's no good news.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.760]   There's no thrilling joy there.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.160]   There's no acclamation.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.880]   It's all man and man's power and what man is being exalted to do.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.800]   But the essence of the gospel is that it is an announcement, I say, of what God has done
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.400]   once and forever for us and our salvation in the person of his dearly begotten Son.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:04.080]   And so it goes on like this, "By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.520]   It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should burst.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.640]   We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus."
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.040]   You see, my dear friends, this is the very essence of the gospel.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:21.680]   I remember when we were back in the third chapter, I spent some time in emphasizing
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.000]   the tremendous break that comes halfway through that chapter.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.080]   Let me just read some verses to you.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   Listen.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.520]   Here's how the gospel comes.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.560]   I begin to read at the 19th verse of the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.120]   "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them that are under
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.920]   the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.920]   God.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:53.600]   Therefore, by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight,
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:59.760]   for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.400]   Oh, for the voice of an archangel.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:13.000]   "But now the righteousness of God, apart from the law, is manifested, being witnessed
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.200]   by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ,
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.480]   unto all and upon all them that believe.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.760]   For there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:36.440]   justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.440]   That's the gospel.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   That's the glad tidings.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.480]   That's the good news.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.920]   That's the thing that makes Charles Wesley cry, "Hark!
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.280]   The herald angels sing, 'Glory to the new-born King, peace on earth and mercy mild.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.120]   God and sinners reconciled.'"
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Why?
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.560]   You see, this is a gospel that makes a man shout.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.480]   Those other teachings, there's nothing to shout about.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.840]   And they don't shout.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.520]   They mince their words.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.880]   They're polite.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.680]   That's not gospel.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.920]   There's no abandon.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   There's no liberty.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   There's no glory.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   There's no praise.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   There's no thanksgiving.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   There's no joy.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   There's no rejoicing.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.400]   It isn't a gospel.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.960]   It's the Antichrist.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.720]   It's a false gospel that is not a gospel.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.440]   And we must reject it with the whole of our being.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.680]   Well, my friends, we've got to leave it at that for tonight.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.240]   God willing, in three weeks' time we'll go on with this.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:43.840]   We are still dealing, remember, with the message that God gives to the preacher to proclaim,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.080]   to herald, and to pronounce.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.800]   Whatever else you may hold or forget, hold on to this.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.600]   If the message that comes to you is not one of the most thrilling good news you've ever
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.520]   heard, reject it.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.280]   It's not the gospel.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.000]   The gospel is glad tidings of good things.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Let us pray.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.320]   O Lord, our God, we do indeed come to thee to praise and to magnify thy great and holy
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.320]   name.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:21.760]   O give us, we pray thee, a thousand tongues to sing our great Redeemer's praise.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.280]   The glories of our God and King, the triumphs of His grace.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:35.040]   O Lord, open our eyes that we may be living witnesses to the true gospel and make all
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.880]   else to appear for the nothing that it is.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:46.360]   Lord, deal with us thy people and so fill us with thy spirit and with understanding
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:52.560]   that we shall see it and know it and believe it and live it, be mastered by it and ever
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.920]   be worthy representatives of it, holding forth the word of life in the midst of a crooked
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.240]   and perverse generation.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.760]   Hear us, O Lord, our God.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.480]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:24.320]   the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.840]   Amen.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
