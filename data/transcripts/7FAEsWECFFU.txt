[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.200]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the seventh chapter, reading from the beginning
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.900]   of verse seventeen to the beginning of verse twenty. From the beginning of the seventeenth
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.780]   verse to the first phrase in the twentieth verse of the seventh chapter of the Book of
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.380]   the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.940]   But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.060]   grew and multiplied in Egypt, till another king arose which knew not Joseph. The same
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.900]   dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:55.660]   children to the end they might not live, in which time Moses was born.
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.260]   It is very essential, if we are to gather the lessons that we should from that statement,
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.880]   that we should hold in our minds the context in which those words were first uttered. Those
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.980]   who attend here regularly will be familiar, of course, with that context, but for the
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.820]   sake of others, let me remind you very briefly and hurriedly of the context of these words.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.540]   They were spoken by the first Christian martyr, whose name was Stephen. Here was a man who
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.820]   had become a Christian, and more than that, he had been appointed a deacon in the Christian
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.940]   church, to do certain work and carry out certain functions. And amongst these, he was a man
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.180]   who spoke and preached, and he was a man who was given miraculous power. And the previous
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.740]   chapter tells us that as a result of his Christian activities, he fell foul of certain important
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.980]   people in Jerusalem, and he was arrested and put on trial. And here, in this seventh chapter,
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.540]   we find this man Stephen, standing before the great court in Jerusalem, which was known
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.460]   as the Sanhedrin. It consisted of very important people, scribes and Pharisees, Sadducees,
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.860]   the priestly party, the Herodians, the politicians, and others. It was indeed a gathering together
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.980]   of the leaders of the nation, and they put Stephen on trial. They charged him with blasphemy,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:45.180]   that because he was preaching Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.940]   This fellow whom they regarded as but a carpenter, this to them was blasphemy. And of course,
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.060]   in preaching our Lord, Stephen was saying things which they misinterpreted as being
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.180]   denunciations of the law of Moses and of Moses himself. They thought that he was also denouncing
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.580]   the temple and its ceremonial enrichment. Now, these first Christians were in a sense
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.700]   doing that. They said that Christ was the fulfillment of the law, that he was the fulfillment
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.980]   of all the old ceremonial, the types and the shadows had all been fulfilled in him, so
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.980]   you didn't need your temple any longer and all your burnt offerings and sacrifices and
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.100]   so on. Well, the result of all this was that Stephen is here on trial, and on trial, of
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.380]   course, for his life, because he's being charged with blasphemy. And what we have in this seventh
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.580]   chapter is Stephen's address to the Sanhedrin. You see the introduction, the first verse
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.620]   puts it like this, "Then said the high priest to Stephen, 'Are these things so?' And he,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.140]   Stephen, said, 'Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken.' And then there follows his great
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:05.020]   and his magisterial defense." And I've been trying to show the basis of this defense.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.100]   It's a fairly long report that we have here, an unusually long report of any speech or
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.100]   sermon as delivered under the auspices of the early church. Of course, because of that,
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.780]   it is particularly valuable, because it is, in a sense, a kind of standard or pattern
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.820]   for Christian preaching, Christian apologetic, if you like. Here is a man who's being called
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.580]   upon to justify what he claims to believe as a Christian and what he is. So here is
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.780]   the essential Christian case as presented by this remarkable man, Stephen, filled with
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.420]   the Holy Ghost, as we are told in the previous chapter, the first Christian martyr.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.180]   Now, the scheme that he adopts is this. He knows that these members of the Sanhedrin
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.980]   as typical Jews are very proud of their history, their own background, their own story as a
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.980]   nation and as a people. So he puts his case in terms of that very history. What he's out
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.300]   to do, of course, is to show them that they've misunderstood their own history. He brings
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.620]   home this point very definitely towards the end. He points out how they are completely
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.100]   misunderstanding their own story, even as their forefathers attempted to do throughout
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.860]   the centuries. They've misunderstood the whole point of the law. They've misunderstood the
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.820]   function of the temple. But above all, they have completely failed to see the significance
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.900]   of Jesus of Nazareth. They're blind. They resist the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.180]   Now, that's the essence of his case, and so he does it like this. He takes up particularly
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.380]   outstanding characters and events in this long story. He starts, of course, with Abraham,
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.980]   and we've already considered that story and the use that Stephen makes of it. Then he
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.700]   takes up a second case, the case of Joseph, and shows very plainly that the members of
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.900]   the Sanhedrin, in rejecting the Lord Jesus Christ, are simply doing exactly what Joseph's
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.580]   brethren have done with Joseph. This is the old failing, the old characteristic, and we've
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.900]   also considered that. Now, we come to his third case. You see, he
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.420]   selects these individuals, these outstanding individuals, and the third is the case of
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:30.980]   Moses, and that's the one we are now looking at. Here again, he's able to use this old
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:40.660]   story to show why it really is that these members of the Sanhedrin are rejecting Christ
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.020]   and his teaching and his wonderful salvation. That's what Stephen is anxious to do, and
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.780]   he does so. Now, we are only considering at the moment the very introduction of the story
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.460]   of Moses. We began this last Sunday night, and what we saw was this, that the very terms
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.760]   in which Stephen puts the case show very plainly that Stephen is bringing home to them this
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:14.340]   charge, that they're entirely wrong in their whole understanding of history. Now, I'm doing
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.580]   all this, let me say, not because I'm moved or animated by some sort of antiquarian or
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.460]   merely historical interest. My dear friends, I'm trying to do what Stephen did. My whole
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.220]   point is to show you that everybody who rejects Christianity today is doing exactly the same
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.260]   thing as the members of the Sanhedrin, who in turn were simply repeating the traditional
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:42.940]   error of the Jewels. It's still true. So what Stephen isolates here as the particularly
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.940]   important points are exactly the same tonight, and my business is to try to show you that.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.980]   So I was able to show last Sunday night that the main trouble with mankind that rejects
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:00.420]   Christianity is this, that they don't understand the meaning of history. When the time of the
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:08.080]   promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, he has history, God had promised.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.780]   He had told Abraham that his descendants were going down into Egypt and that they'd be there
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:20.820]   in captivity for all these years, that they'd be there for over 400 years in that strange
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:28.700]   land in a bondage. He tells them that in the sixth verse of this chapter, God had told
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.780]   Abraham that, and there they are, and it all comes to pass. But now, the end of the 400
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:40.860]   years is drawing nigh, and God is about to act. Mankind doesn't realize this. We think
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.780]   of history in human terms. History to us is the activity of men, kings, princes, births,
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:51.740]   marriages, deaths, war, and we miss the real grand thing in history, which is the intervention
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:58.860]   of God. We were able to show that. We were able to show, furthermore, that mankind not
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.900]   only misunderstands history, it resists God's purpose in history. A king arose which knew
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.780]   not Joseph, and he set himself up against the purpose of God in these children of Israel.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.700]   He didn't know what he was doing, of course. It's ignorance. Sin is always due to ignorance.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:23.100]   Ignorance of God, ignorance of the purpose of God. Its base in gratitude knew not Joseph.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.380]   Joseph had saved his nation. He wouldn't have been there at all, but for Joseph, all
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:33.260]   forgotten in gratitude. But above all, he was blind to the fact that God's purposes
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:41.780]   are ever sure, and he had to wait until he and his hosts and his chariots were overwhelmed
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.060]   and drowned in the Red Sea to learn the lesson that he had refused to learn.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:53.100]   Now, there is the point at which we've arrived, but that's only the introduction. Here, in
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.700]   a very remarkable manner, Stephen pinpoints, as it were, some of the most salient features
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.460]   and characteristics of the Gospel, and at the same time shows us and gives us instruction
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:10.620]   as to why it is that people can't see it, and why they reject this Gospel. And I want
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.620]   to show you a further example of this this evening, and it's a particularly relevant
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:23.940]   one at the present time. There's a body of people today who reject Christianity, reject
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:32.860]   the Gospel, ridicule Christianity. They do so because they call themselves humanists.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:40.460]   This is what they are and believe in, and they put this over and against this old message,
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:47.020]   this old Gospel. Unfortunately, this is something that is not only done by people who call themselves
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:57.260]   specifically humanists. Their work is aided, alas, by others who call themselves Christian,
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:03.980]   but who so denude the Gospel of its most glorious features and characteristics that virtually
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:10.340]   they are themselves nothing but humanists also. They still cling to a certain amount
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.180]   of the terminology and phraseology, but they reject everything that is essential. They
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.660]   do it in the name of Christianity, but they're nothing in a sense but humanists.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:28.100]   Now, I want to show you how this particular introduction to the case of Moses rarely deals
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:34.420]   with these people who reject Christianity in terms of what is called humanism. What
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.760]   are the characteristics of this particular attitude, this humanistic attitude, that rejects
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.380]   the Christian Gospel? Well, in the main, I think they can be described as the following
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:51.740]   three things. The first is that it is a view which is characterized by a denial of and
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:12:01.900]   an exclusion of the supernatural. It is an outlook that is determined entirely by man's
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:10.740]   mind and ability. Humanism. Man, you see. Human being. Homo sapiens. He's the center
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:18.340]   of everything, and it is his mind that determines everything. If he doesn't understand, he
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:25.900]   rejects. That alone is true, which appeals to him and commends itself to him. The humanist.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:32.260]   The human mind is the controlling factor and is to be the measure of everything. So everything
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:39.340]   supernatural is automatically excluded. The second thing which characterizes this teaching
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:47.300]   is that it's a view of religion, to speak generally, a view of Christianity is, that
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:55.100]   it is just something which man has invented. They are kind enough to say at times that
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.020]   they were prepared to grant that perhaps there have been times in the past when this sort
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.540]   of thing has had its value and has had its use. When people were more or less primitive
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.940]   and backward, there was some value in this. And their view is that what we call Christianity,
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:19.020]   this Christian faith, religion, that this is just a human invention. It was what men
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:25.920]   thought at that time. But obviously, human thought is bound to change from age to age.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.300]   And as you make your grand discoveries and as you develop and advance, well, the thinking
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.380]   of men is bound to change. So they say, "By now, we really should be adult." Man has
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:42.380]   grown up. He's come of age now. And he doesn't go on repeating these old ideas, which were
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.400]   all right and appropriate perhaps to 2,000 years ago, perhaps even to 100 years ago,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:54.260]   but not to the modern man of 1967, who has all this vast scientific knowledge. Now they
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:00.020]   say, "You see, man has made his religions, and there have been his attempts to explain
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.620]   his life and his circumstances, his environment, and so on." Well, now, all of that, we've
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:11.420]   now seen through that. And we now are able to think and to legislate, as it were, in
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.540]   a different manner. That's their view, essentially, of religion.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:21.800]   Now, the third thing that characterizes this view is this. And it is, of course, quite
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.260]   logical from the first two things I've been saying. The third thing is that they believe
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:34.460]   that man can save himself, and he can save society. He can save the world. He can do
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:40.820]   so by his own efforts. All he needs is the knowledge, and he is garnering it and gathering
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.380]   it increasingly. And all that is necessary is that he should be given this knowledge
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.900]   and information, and then he will proceed to apply it by means of his willpower. And
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:56.980]   so, he will save himself, and he will save society.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:03.260]   And in terms of this, and on these grounds, Christianity is rejected, as the members of
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:09.220]   the Sanhedrin rejected Christ and his message, who'd lived amongst them, and whose death
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.940]   on the cross they'd witnessed. As they rejected it all, and all the phenomena of the day of
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:21.940]   Pentecost and the subsequent events, as they rejected it all, so men and women are rejecting
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:27.460]   it at the present time. And I want to try to show you tonight how this very modern,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.460]   ultra-modern, if you like, attitude is dealt with and is answered here very simply and
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.700]   very plainly by the mere introduction of Moses into the story of the children of Israel.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:47.700]   The answers are these. The first is that we are reminded by Stephen's statement, he's
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.740]   already done it in the case of Abraham and of Joseph, we are reminded that, after all,
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:16:01.260]   we are dealing with history. We are dealing with events. We're dealing with facts. The
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.700]   Christian religion, the Christian faith, unlike every other teaching, is something that is
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:14.340]   based solidly on facts. You have no right, in common honesty, to say that this is a human
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.020]   invention, that this is just the expression of certain ideas that have come into the minds
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:25.080]   of certain men in the past. No, the Bible is, first and foremost, a book of history,
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.940]   a book of facts. Of course, these people are thoroughly inconsistent. They sometimes complain
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.180]   of all these historical books in the Old Testament. Very good, it's a very right complaint, but
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:40.180]   they're admitting the truth unconsciously. It is a book of history, and the facts are
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:49.340]   absolutely vital and essential. We are dealing with a people, a nation, called the children
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:57.220]   of Israel, the Jews. And we are concerned with all this record of these people, how
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:04.700]   they ever came into being. Through Abraham, they're going down to Egypt, the exodus out
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.720]   of Egypt, the things that happened to them on the way, the entry into the land of Canaan.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.840]   Because at this time, as Stephen reminds them, they were living in Canaan, and they knew
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.100]   all this history. It's the significance they failed to understand. But you see, here, all
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:28.780]   along, we are being reminded that we are dealing with sure facts of history. Jesus of Nazareth
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.780]   is a fact of history. Now, I don't go over that again, because I dealt with it in a sense
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:41.100]   last Sunday night. If you call this year 1967, you are granting my major premise. You are
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:48.740]   granting that this individual, Jesus of Nazareth, has changed everything in history, even your
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:55.260]   calendars. He's a fact of history. He belongs solidly to history. There can be no question
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:04.060]   about this at all. And you see, it all emerges out of this Old Testament history. Now, it's
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:09.560]   rather odd that this curious idea should be current today, that Christianity is just a
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:16.180]   philosophy, just one of the philosophies or a view of life or a way of living only. It's
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:23.540]   odd that this, I say, should gain currency at the present time, because archaeology is
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:31.380]   more and more confirming the historical veracity of the Bible. People used to talk glibly and
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.300]   freely fifty years ago that this and that was wrong. But you know, the more the archaeologists
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.980]   work, the more they are verifying the facts that are stated in the Bible. Now, this is
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:48.720]   a most crucial and important point. This is not just a philosophy. The essence of this
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.560]   message is this, that there is something happening in the whole process of history, initiated
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.700]   and carried on by God, which is the biggest thing of all in human history. That's our
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:07.300]   first answer to these humanists. It's emphasized here. When the time of the promise drew nigh
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:12.980]   which God had sworn to Abram, and then in which time Moses was born, there's a fact
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.740]   of history. A child was born, he was given the name of Moses, and we shall be dealing
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.860]   with the facts in the history of this manner. It's concrete history, it's events, it's
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:29.540]   facts. It is not theory. There is no message apart from the facts. So this attempt to save
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:35.660]   Christianity by denying the facts on which it is based is indeed the greatest denial
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.980]   of all of the Christian message. It is solidly based upon the facts, and if these are not
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:48.340]   facts, there is no message. It's all imagination. The second thing that is demonstrated here
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:58.340]   is this, that the great facts, the great outstanding facts of history, are quite inexplicable on
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:06.260]   the basis of humanism. What do I mean? Well, I again am referring to the story of the Jews.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:12.460]   Now, I don't care for the moment what your view of Christianity may be, but you are confronted
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:21.300]   by the fact of the Jew, the Jewish nation, this people, this phenomenon in history, that
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:30.380]   I say is completely inexplicable in terms of humanism alone. You read the story of this
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:37.220]   people. Can you explain them in terms of human ideas? Did they come into being because somebody
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:43.300]   had an idea, a brilliant idea, a wonderful notion? Can you explain their persistence,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:49.140]   their continuance, their history as it's regarded in the Old Testament, in terms of men and
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:55.580]   their wisdom and their understanding? Of course you can. Thank God the Bible is a very honest
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:00.860]   book. It doesn't take these people, the chosen people of God, and paint a glowing picture
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.580]   of them. It tells us the absolute truth about them. The Bible is much more truthful than
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.860]   your newspapers. The Bible tells you everything. It gives you the good and the bad. It gives
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:18.740]   the story exactly as it happened. And the essence of the story is this, that the children
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:25.820]   of Israel came into being and continued and succeeded for one reason only. That was that
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:32.180]   in spite of them, they were God's people and he did things for them. They spent most of
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:37.220]   their time in rebelling against him. They'd take up any sort of God they'd happen to meet.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.180]   I mean by that, they'd meet another nation, worship idols. They were always ready to bow
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.940]   down to these idols, these false gods, and turn their back upon the God of Israel. They
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:52.340]   kept on doing it. The story is here. And you can't understand them except on this one basis
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:59.340]   and hypothesis, that it's God acting. They're God's people and it's in spite of themselves.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.140]   And take these notable victories that they had, which again are facts of history. You
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.180]   can find them confirmed by your secular history books as well as by your archaeology. These
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.180]   notable victories, when a handful of Jews, as it were, would rout a great army of Assyrians
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:20.100]   or Chaldeans or somebody else. How do you explain that? There's only one explanation.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:26.980]   It isn't the humanist explanation. It completely breaks down in its explanation of history.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.500]   But it's true not only in general as Stephen is here showing of the children of Israel,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:41.860]   it is true also in the lives of the outstanding individuals in that long story. These men,
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.620]   every one of them, are explained in one way only, and that is in their relationship to
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:52.340]   God. We've seen it in the case of Abram. We've seen it in the case of Joseph. Here it is
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:58.260]   in the case of Moses again. It's equally true in the case of David the king, that outstanding
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.260]   king of Israel. There's a man who sunk to the depths in sin, was guilty of the most
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:09.780]   foul things, and yet he stands out as a great man and a great leader simply because he was
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:16.700]   after all God's men in spite of his sinfulness and his unworthiness. You can't explain them.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:23.700]   You can't explain them at all. David meeting Goliath, the thing is ridiculous. No humanism
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:31.060]   can explain that. This is God, and it's God acting right away through. And of course when
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.980]   you come to the story of the beginning of Christianity in the New Testament, the same
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:44.060]   thing is still more obvious. You see, if you reject this gospel, well then what you've
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:52.100]   got to do is to explain Jesus of Nazareth. Explain him on any of your philosophies. The
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.540]   only answer concerning him was given by the prophet Isaiah eight hundred years before
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:04.660]   he was ever born. He's a root out of a dry ground. You can't explain him. He's inexplicable
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:11.220]   in terms of evolution, in terms of secular history or of anything else. He's a phenomenon.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:17.900]   He appears and he battles human understanding. There he is confronting us still. You can't
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:25.620]   explain him on any other terms. You can't explain him except in terms of the miraculous
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:32.100]   and the supernatural and the divine. I'm referring to his birth, his upbringing, his
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.740]   understanding at the age of twelve, his teaching, his incomparable teaching. This man, this
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:44.220]   carpenter, how do you explain it? You can't explain it. Humanism is bankrupt at this point.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:51.660]   We are confronted by a fact, a phenomenon of history, which cannot be explained on those
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:57.900]   terms, and it doesn't only apply to our Lord. You explain the phenomenon of the Christian
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.860]   church, why men have done their best to ruin the church throughout the centuries as they're
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.380]   doing today. There's only one reason why the church is still in existence tonight. It isn't
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.860]   because what men have thought or done. It's in spite of them. It's God. And you see, one
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.740]   of the greatest men that's ever appeared in the church is a man we shall be considering
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.340]   later his wonderful story, Saul of Tarsus, the man who wrote that seventh chapter of
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.620]   the epistle to the Romans that I read to you at the beginning. Look at this giant, this
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:34.100]   colossus, this mighty flaming man. How do you explain him? How can you explain him in
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:41.760]   terms of humanism? It's monstrous. It's ridiculous. The only explanation of this man is the explanation
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:47.420]   that he gives himself. It's the same with many a giant that has appeared since, men
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:56.540]   like St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, these mighty men of God. You can't
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:02.820]   explain these men. To every other form of thinking, these are some sort of exceptions
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.740]   that can't be accounted for. But you see, I'm only selecting them because they're well
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.420]   known. Thank God this doesn't apply only to the giants. There are thousands, millions
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.580]   of ordinary, unheard of people who share the same wonderful experience and testify to the
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:26.540]   same things. And I say this is all but evidence to prove that the greatest and the most important
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:32.060]   facts and events in history simply cannot be explained in humanistic terms, but can
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.380]   only be explained in the terms that Stephen is here elaborating before the members of
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:45.060]   the Sanhedrin. And I've already referred to the fact that men would long since have finished
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:52.300]   the Christian church. Man always goes astray. Man's always a fool. Man's always degrading
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.020]   everything he touches. And there's only one explanation, I say, of the persistence of
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:04.220]   the church. It is God's repeated intervention in what is called revival, when he comes and
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:10.940]   raises the moribund Christian church and fills it with power and charges it a new and a fresh
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:17.140]   and sends it on for another glorious period of reformation and revival. It's the only
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:23.940]   explanation. You can't explain the history of this country apart from this. You're confronted
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:29.700]   by certain concrete events, which are quite inexplicable. Men are trying to explain them,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:35.060]   but there is no explanation. Some do it in terms of psychology and so on, but it's very
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:40.800]   simple to point out the fallacy. They never explain the origin of these things. It's comparatively
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.140]   simple to try to explain these things psychologically once a revival has started, but what starts
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:51.500]   it? That's the thing they can never explain. How do these things begin? They're completely
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.940]   dumb. They've got nothing to say at all. But here, you see, is the explanation in which
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:04.100]   time Moses was born. Very well, there's the second point, but let me put this third general
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:12.740]   point before I come to just a few details. What is truly astonishing to me is that the
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:20.820]   facts of life today are not evidently showing men who hold these views antagonistic to the
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:30.420]   gospel that all their theories are falsified before their very eyes. Fancy preaching humanism
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:37.060]   in an age like this. Fancy preaching human reliance in an age such as this. If there
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.540]   is one thing that this present age is doing more than anything else, it is to show the
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:48.780]   complete bankruptcy and failure of humanism and what is called sometimes good paganism.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.180]   I think I may have referred to a book before which is most illuminating on this subject.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:59.260]   It was written during the war. The title is The Failure of the Good Pagan, written by
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:09.420]   Rosalind Murray, who was a daughter of a famous classical humanist, a professor at Oxford.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:16.220]   The failure of the good paganist, and that is, I say, the great lesson of history at
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:25.420]   the present time. Man has been shown to be a complete failure. Society is breaking down.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:31.860]   Things are collapsing. But remember, this is happening at the end of the century, during
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:38.060]   which mankind is increasingly scoffed at Christianity, turned its back upon it in terms of knowledge
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:44.660]   and advance and science and development. It is at this very point that all that man has
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:53.140]   claimed for himself is proving to be utterly and entirely bankrupt. The teaching of the
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:30:00.260]   gospel has been discarded. Man was going to make a world for himself, a wonderful world,
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:06.940]   delivered from the incubus of religion, this dope, this opium of the people. Man could
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:12.860]   march forward, and you see where he is marching to. He is marching very rapidly in the direction
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:19.260]   of a jungle. Well, now then, my friends, there you see is the superficial answer, as it were,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.820]   to humanism. Just the facts that are noted here, as it were, in passing by Stephen, they
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:31.660]   answer it immediately. But the question for us is this. What is it that can possess mankind
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:38.340]   to make it fall into such a tragic fallacy? What is it about man that makes him reject
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:46.660]   this glorious gospel, which is his only hope, and put his faith in man, in humanism or whatever
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:54.460]   he may chance to call it? Well, now, this is again revealed unto us here quite plainly.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:01.100]   This is the explanation of this tragic fact and phenomenon. It is first and foremost due
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:09.740]   to a failure to realize the depth of the problem confronting us. Where do I find that? Well,
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.580]   I find it here. What we are about to consider, you see, is the story of the deliverance of
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:20.380]   the children of Israel from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt. This is what we are
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:26.020]   told. We are told that when the time of the promise drew nigh which God had sworn to Abraham,
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:31.220]   the people grew and multiplied in Egypt till another king arose which knew not Joseph.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:39.140]   The same dealt subtly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:45.380]   out their young children to the end they might not live. If you take the trouble to read
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.460]   the early chapters of the book of Exodus, you will get the great story told to you in
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:56.060]   considerable detail. But I can summarize it by putting it like this. This king, who knew
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:03.620]   not Joseph, was a tyrant, a dictator, and he began to oppress these children of Israel.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   Indeed, he was out to exterminate them. They had become a menace to him and a danger and
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:14.340]   a problem. So he is determined to put an end to them. He is going to destroy them. And
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:19.380]   you will read there the facts of what he did. Now, the thing that stands out in the story
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:27.580]   is this, that the children of Israel were in a position of complete slavery. They had
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:33.420]   no armies or armaments of their own. They had become slaves, they had become servants.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.100]   They are forced to make bricks without an adequate supply of straw to enable them to
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:44.060]   go through the process. They are being lashed by the whips of their taskmasters. They are
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:50.780]   in a condition of complete slavery and serfdom. That is the story, which is put here in a
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:59.300]   very summary manner by Stephen. Now, the Bible itself tells us that the story of the deliverance
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:04.540]   of the children of Israel from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt is a kind of type
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:10.460]   of the great salvation that the Son of God came into the world to bring. It is used like
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.140]   that repeatedly in the Bible, and the Church has used it like this throughout the centuries.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.140]   It is undoubtedly something that we are meant to do. We have the sanction and the authority
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.140]   of Stephen for doing it here, and our Lord himself uses the same example.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:30.320]   Very well, then, I say, here you see is the great lesson we have to learn. Why is it people
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:36.360]   reject Christianity and trust the humanism? The first answer is because their thinking
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:42.220]   is so superficial that they have never even seen the depth of their problem. That is the
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:48.100]   final trouble with the humanist. He is so superficial that a man can be optimistic at
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.460]   a time like this and say, "Leave it to us, and we are going to put this right ourselves
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:34:00.140]   with our own ideas and teach." The thing is pathetic. Poor things, they have never
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:06.620]   even seen the nature of the problem confronting them. If they only knew this story of the
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.980]   serfdom of the children of Israel, they would see it in a picture, a parable at the same
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   time, and a position of abject, complete slavery. Why is the world as it is tonight? We have
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.880]   multiplied our educational institutions. We have never had so many books to read. The
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.860]   cultural agencies are multiplying themselves from year to year, and yet the position goes
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:36.780]   from bad to worse. What is the matter? We have had two world wars in this century. They
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.020]   are toying with the possibility of a third and playing with things that could blow up
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:46.420]   the whole universe. What is the matter with men? Here is the question. What is the problem?
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.700]   Is this something that needs just a slight adjustment or a little bit of teaching? Oh,
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:57.700]   the thinking of men apart from the Bible is so superficial. It is pathetic in its superficiality.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:03.420]   No, no, the problem is too deep for all this. What is it? Well, you see, the Bible tells
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:15.340]   us it is this. It is ultimately the problem of evil, the problem of the devil. Do you
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:22.100]   remember how the Apostle Paul puts it? He says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:28.060]   but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:33.620]   against spiritual wickedness in high places." He says, "Our problem is not flesh and blood.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:41.320]   It is not men. There are unseen powers." Or, as he puts it again, he says, "You earthy
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.140]   quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past he walked according
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:52.220]   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:59.580]   that now worketh in the children of disobedience." Now, I know perfectly well that the humanist,
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:05.780]   the modern man, laughs with scorn and ridicule when he hears a man saying something like
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.700]   that. What? He says, "Do you still believe in the devil?" In 1967, what? Believing in
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:16.780]   the devil still, believing in evil spirits, of course. I can't understand the world unless
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:23.500]   I do. I have no explanation of the human tragedy, the human problem, except in terms of this.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.980]   In spite of all the efforts and the endeavors of what we call civilization, the world goes
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:33.300]   the other way. Why? Oh, there is another power that the world doesn't know about, stronger
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:40.220]   than men, the power of the devil, the power of hell. Our Lord taught this. The strong
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:49.140]   man armed keepeth his goods in peace. The devil, the tyrant, the pharaoh, the king that
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:55.780]   knew not Joseph, that bright angelic being that rebelled against God and pitted himself
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:01.080]   against him and wanted to share the universe with him and even get it out of his hands,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.060]   the one who met Christ in the temptation in the wilderness, trying to drag him down, confident
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:11.420]   that he could, "If thou be the Son of God," his self-confidence, his arrogance, he tried
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:19.460]   it, he failed, but all the power. We are told that our Lord was so exhausted by it that
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:26.820]   angels came and ministered unto him, the power of evil, the power of the devil, the power
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:33.580]   of sin. The trouble with men is not that he doesn't know enough. No, no, he's got the
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:40.020]   knowledge. His trouble is that he's wrong himself. Sin isn't negative. Sin is very positive.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:46.940]   It's a positive force. It's a power. There is this realm of evil, principalities and
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:52.740]   powers, rulers of the darkness of this world, manipulating the minds of men, organizing
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:58.060]   evil, stirring it up, keeping it going. In spite of all our efforts and endeavors, the
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:04.500]   modern world is proving this. And a man who has never seen the demonic character of the
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:11.540]   modern problem is Demeurest Tyrell. He's a very superficial thinker. You can't explain
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:18.460]   a man like Hitler merely in terms of humanity. No, no, there was another element. There was
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:25.860]   a demonic element, and it's in the whole tragedy of life at the present time. Now, the humanist,
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.620]   he knows nothing about this. And that's where he fails completely. He hasn't even understood
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.900]   his problem. He can't diagnose, leave alone treat. It's not surprising that he ends in
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:41.220]   such failure. But then in addition to that, there is the power of sin itself that is within
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:50.940]   us. Sin is a slavery. You can't dispute that. You can't dispute that sin is slavery. I can
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.900]   easily prove it to you. Why do you keep on doing the thing you know to be wrong? If you're
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:01.980]   free, why don't you stop it? Why aren't you perfect? There's only one answer. You're a
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.180]   slave. The teaching of the Bible is that sin is a slavery. It talks about the dominion
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:15.580]   of sin, the dominion of Satan, and it's got us in its grip. And this is the story of the
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.580]   human race. You'll see it in the biographies. You'll see it in the autobiographies. You'll
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:27.300]   see it in the great tragedies of Shakespeare. This malign, evil, influence power that dominates
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.860]   men in spite of their own thinking and efforts and endeavors and gets them down. There is
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:38.660]   a divinity that shapes our ends, or a few of them, though we may. Evil as well as another
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:43.700]   one which is on the good side. You can't understand life. You can't understand history. You can't
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:49.460]   understand yourself unless you know something about the dominion of sin and the dominion
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.580]   of Satan. But the moment you understand this other factor, you're in no difficulty about
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:00.180]   explaining the modern world, because the power of Satan is second only to the power of God
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:06.740]   himself. But the humanist doesn't know this. And this power, as we are shown here, is out
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:14.860]   to destroy us. It is a power that is intent upon the destruction of the soul. It's to
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:21.180]   make men an animal and less. It is to produce death. That's what sin did at the beginning.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:26.780]   It produced death. There would have been no death but for sin, but for evil, but for Satan.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:33.580]   It always brings in death, spiritual death, moral death, physical death. It's always destructive
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:40.420]   of that which is best in men. As this pharaoh tried to destroy the children of Israel through
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.420]   sending out his enactment about that every male child was to be put to death and so on,
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:52.860]   so sin is out to destroy that which is best and living and most glorious in human nature.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:41:01.180]   And there it leaves us, helpless slaves. And under the wrath of God, whom we've offended
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:06.540]   and whom we've defied, whom we are ignoring, whom we are ridiculing, and setting ourselves
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.660]   up as God instead of him. There is the position. Now the humanist fails completely to understand
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:18.180]   this point that Stephen is making here to the members of the Sanhedrin. But secondly,
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:24.820]   this view fails in exactly the same way to realize men's complete and utter helplessness
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:32.500]   in this bondage and in this serfdom. And this is the most urgent and vital point that we
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:40.820]   have got to realize. Those children of Israel were completely helpless. Not only helpless
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:45.620]   in and of themselves, but they could do nothing about this position in which they were. Pharaoh
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.180]   had got everything. He'd got the horses, he'd got the chariots, he'd got the spears, he'd
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:56.140]   got everything. They'd got nothing. They were completely helpless. They could do nothing.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.420]   It's no use calling a mass meeting. It wouldn't have been allowed. If it had been allowed,
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:05.460]   they couldn't put it into practice. They're absolutely groaning, held down, and are incapable
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:12.660]   of doing anything. That's what the Bible's teaching about the whole of mankind as the
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.780]   result of the fall of men and as the result of sin. Men's not only become a slave, he
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:24.220]   is completely helpless. But you see, this other teaching tells us that men can save
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:33.580]   himself. It bases everything on human intelligence, human understanding, and a human willpower.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:38.860]   We are being told today that a man can save himself, he can save society. We want to get
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:45.500]   rid of all this, which has been the hindrance, and man must be set free to save himself and
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:54.940]   to save the world. Oh, the fallacy, the tragic fallacy. Man is completely helpless. These
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:43:03.100]   men who talk so glibly, they can't save themselves. They can talk very well about certain general
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:10.380]   problems, but you see, the light-hearted question always comes back to this, what of the personal
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:17.900]   life? It's a very simple thing to talk about world problems. I can solve world problems
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   much more easily than I can solve my own problems. It's a simple thing to get up and to give
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.340]   advice to statesmen, tell the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary what to say in Rome
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:33.420]   tomorrow morning. How simple it is. And to tell all the other nations what they should
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:38.140]   be doing. And these humanists, they write their clever articles Sunday after Sunday.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:43.300]   It's always at the weekend. The intelligentsia have got the time to read, and they settle
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.500]   and handle these great problems, and they've been doing it for years. But look at your
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:57.620]   world. Oh, the sham and the mockery and the hypocrisy of it all. But I say it's a comparatively
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:08.100]   easy thing to do that. But the question is, what about this man's own personal life? Can
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:16.220]   your humanist find peace and rest and quiet of heart and of mind? Can he truly face death?
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:21.660]   Can he deal with what has been called the running sore of his own soul? Can he live
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.980]   a good, a clean, a decent, a pure life? Can they overcome the sin that so easily besets
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:34.300]   them and that gets them down? These are the questions, and the answer is they cannot.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:41.620]   No man has ever done it, and they cannot. They talk in generalities. They fail in the
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:47.900]   individual practical problems. But you see, this is where I see the final exposure of
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:53.340]   humanism. They not only cannot save themselves, they've got still less to give to anybody
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:45:01.260]   else. You do away with this gospel and accept this humanistic teaching, then you will have
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.740]   to postulate that a man's got intelligence, that he's got understanding, that he can follow
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:10.460]   your philosophy, that he can reason it out, that he can think, and then, having done that,
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:17.820]   having grasped the teaching, he can then proceed to put it into practice. But the vast majority
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:24.140]   of us are not intelligent, and we haven't got this great understanding. We are not clever.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:29.940]   We can't read textbooks on philosophy. We can't follow these great arguments. And even
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:37.500]   if we could, we can't put them into practice. Here is my challenge to humanism. What does
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:44.260]   humanism to give to a man that's made a wreck of his life? You see, they say that a man
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:49.020]   can save himself. All he needs is knowledge and understanding. But I know highly intelligent
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:53.380]   men who have made wrecks of their own lives. I know men who have passed through the best
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.020]   universities of this country, who are slaves to particular sins, and they do everything
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:05.160]   if they could only stop. They can't stop. What does all this clever talk and teaching
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:11.860]   to offer, I say, to the ordinary men and women in this world at the present time who hasn't
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:17.620]   the time nor the intelligence to grasp these highfaluting teachings, and who, when he makes
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:23.380]   any kind of effort and strife to save himself, can't do so? What have they got to give him?
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:29.180]   They've got nothing to give him, nothing whatsoever. They say, "Well, of course, if you don't accept
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.980]   our teaching, if you don't pull yourself together and join the ethical of the humanistic society
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.740]   and decide to join with us in advocating these better terms and conditions, well, then we've
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.340]   got nothing to say to you." And they haven't anything to say either. They can only exhort
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:50.260]   you, exhort you to do what they can't do for themselves. This is the final failure of all
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:58.980]   humanism, that it leaves us helpless, hopeless, in the bondage of Egypt. Good advice is useless
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:07.020]   in the bondage and the serfdom of Egypt. Now, now, the trouble is they don't realize men's
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:14.180]   complete helplessness, and he's completely helpless because his very mind is darkened.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:19.580]   His will is in a state of bondage. You see, these people, they don't seem to have read
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:24.020]   the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, the profoundest bit of psychology
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:28.740]   ever written in this respect. There it is for you, set out by the Apostle Paul, "To
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:34.180]   will is present with me, but how to perform I know not. The humanist can tell me what
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:41.420]   to do, but how am I to do it? He tells himself what to do. Can he do it? Of course he can't.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:48.460]   With my mind, with my inner man, I admit I agree that the law of God is good, but I find
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:55.860]   another law in my members, dragging me, drawing me down to the law of sin and death, the evil
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:00.860]   that I would, not that I do, and the good that I would, I do not, all the wretched men
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:07.180]   that I am." They've never seen that. They've never seen that because their thinking is
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:13.660]   so utterly superficial. They've never realized the depth of the problem. They're always talking
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.520]   outside themselves in some theoretical manner, and have never faced the problem of their
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:26.440]   own lives and their own failure. Man in sin is completely helpless. He doesn't know that
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.180]   he's got to come to this point in which he says with Augustus' top lady, "Not the labors
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:38.540]   of my hands can fulfill thy law's demands. Could my zeal now respite? No. Could my tears
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:47.580]   forever flow? All for sin could not atone." Can't do it. Try as I will, this is the story
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.780]   of the best men that the world has ever known, in a sense. This struggle, the endeavor, the
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:58.660]   futile endeavor, to try to understand, to get some magical formula, to get some strength
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:03.380]   from somewhere that will enable them to rise up out of themselves to something bigger and
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:10.380]   higher and nobler. But they've all failed. They unite as a mighty chorus in saying just
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:16.820]   that. "Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy law's demands. Could my zeal now respite?
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:25.260]   No. Could my tears forever flow? All for sin could not atone." We are helpless in the bondage,
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:34.420]   the captivity, the serfdom of Egypt. Why are we yet without strength? That's the condition
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:40.700]   of every individual and of the whole of the human race. Here they are, pictured in a few
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:49.820]   words by Stephen, in the hopelessness of Egypt. But you know the story doesn't end there,
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:58.340]   does it? In which time? Moses was born. What time? The time of the promised runei which
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:04.260]   God had sworn to Abraham. And here you see the whole thing changes. Why? Well, not because
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:09.300]   of anything men has thought of or said or done, but because God acts, and this is the
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:15.500]   message of Christianity. The only hope for an individual or for the world is in the intervention
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:24.940]   of God, God's salvation. And this is the message. This is Christianity. Not good advice,
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:33.700]   not exhortation, but a proclamation, an announcement that God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:41.340]   It is entirely God's work. It is altogether from his side. It's unexpected. But as Paul
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.740]   puts it there in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans in the sixth verse,
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:55.520]   "While we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the young godly."
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.340]   My dear friend, what amazes me is that the whole world doesn't rise up onto its feet
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:07.580]   and shout out, "Hallelujah! Praise God!" You know that hymn we sang at the beginning,
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:13.640]   it put it very well, that great hymn of praise. "Apostles joined the glorious throng and
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:20.540]   swelled the loud immortal song. Prophets enraptured, hear the sound and spread the hallelujah
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:28.980]   round and listen. Victorious martyrs joined their lays and shout." What do they shout?
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:36.860]   The omnipotence of grace. "While all thy church through all the earth acknowledge
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:46.820]   and extol thy worth." The omnipotence of grace! Here's the thing. The children of
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:54.700]   Israel would have come to the end of their story in Egypt were it not that God arose,
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:52:02.700]   God intervened, God began to act. He produced the birth of Moses and did the various things
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:06.820]   that God willing we shall go on to consider together. He did it in due time. When the
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:13.300]   time was come in which time Moses was born, God is arising. God's going to act. Why
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:20.860]   does he do it? Well he does it, you see, in spite of us. He does it in spite of our blasphemy,
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:27.620]   in spite of our arrogant pride, in spite of our foolish self-confidence and all our intellectualism.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:33.020]   He does it though we deserve nothing but punishment and hell at his hands. God is moved by one
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:39.220]   thing only and that is his own eternal love, his mercy, his compassion. Why our Lord has
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:45.820]   pictured this once forever for us in the story of the prodigal son. That's God! A man in
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:52.700]   his rags of miserable failure, the Father running to meet him and embracing him. Oh,
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:58.260]   it's all because of God's love and mercy and compassion. It is because of this great
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:03.980]   plan and purpose of grace and redemption that he has planned before the very foundation
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:10.020]   of the world. But this is the thing I want to leave in your minds. It all depends upon
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:18.420]   his power. There's no power in the children of Israel. They're slaves, defenseless, helpless,
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:25.860]   utterly defeated, down and out. But they came out and they entered Canaan. What's the explanation?
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:39.220]   The power of God. And this is the whole message. God doing the impossible. God with whom nothing
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:46.860]   is impossible, giving salvation and deliverance, bringing out these people in his own miraculous
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:51.940]   way out of the hands of Pharaoh and all the bondage and the slavery, bringing them out,
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:54:00.500]   setting them free, putting them in the new land, the land of promise. And that is precisely
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:06.900]   the message of this Christian faith. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ as the
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:12.900]   apostle Paul to the Romans in chapter 1 and verse 16, "I am not ashamed of the gospel
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:18.380]   of Christ." Why not? And here's his answer. "For it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:24.260]   to everyone that believeth." Paul says, "I'm ready to come to preach in Rome. I'm ready
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:29.140]   to preach to the slaves, the soldiers, the nobodies. I'm equally ready to preach to the
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.860]   emperor. I'm not ashamed of the gospel." Why not? Well, I haven't got a human theory to
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:39.500]   propound. I'm not coming simply to exhort you or to encourage you to live a better life.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:46.220]   I am preaching a message which is the power of God unto salvation. This is God's power.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.900]   Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. God, by sending his own Son to the
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:58.500]   cross on Calvary and laying your sins upon him and punishing you in him and raising him
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:05.580]   again from the dead by his almighty power as open for you and for me a way of salvation.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:13.580]   And it's based upon not my power, not my understanding, but upon the wisdom and the power of God.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:21.260]   Thank God that this is the truth. The humanist condemns us all. He can't do it himself. We
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.660]   can do it still less. He may be a great thinker, but he's a failure and he's nothing to give
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:31.020]   me. If I can't understand his wonderful philosophy and if I can't exercise my willpower in a
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:37.100]   superhuman manner, I'm finished. If I'm a slave of sin, he just passes by. The humanist
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:41.540]   should face the problem of London tonight, its vice, its immorality, the people who've
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.820]   become slaves of drugs and are slaves of sex and everything else. What have they got to
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:54.460]   give him? Nothing, nothing whatsoever. But thank God I'm able to tell them this evening
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:59.820]   if there is any such person listening to me and there almost certainly is. Listen my friend,
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:04.260]   I'm not asking you to save yourself. I know you can't do it. I'm telling you that God
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:10.900]   can save you, that Christ is the power of God. It's his power and the record of the
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:19.220]   church is the history of his triumphs of grace, the wonders of his grace. I could keep you
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:25.140]   for hours in telling you the life story of some of the most notorious sinners who've
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:34.940]   become saints and have adorned the church of God. It is all the power of God, the power
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.580]   that could turn a persecuting Saul of Tarsus into the mighty apostle, the power that could
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:45.980]   deliver the men, Augustine who kept his mistress 15 years and fought and struggled and couldn't
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:53.500]   get free, that delivered him in a flash. The power of God unto salvation that has gone
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:57:00.340]   on saving such individuals throughout the running centuries and is as able and as powerful
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:07.180]   to do it tonight as it has been from the very beginning. My dear friend, all I ask you is
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:14.020]   this. Do you know this power? Your understanding will never save you. Your willpower will never
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.220]   save you. All you've got to do is to admit that you're a failure, that you're a helpless,
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:22.460]   hopeless failure like the children of Israel in the bondage and the captivity of Egypt
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:32.620]   and just cry out unto him. And he will hear you and he will deliver you in his own miraculous
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:38.180]   manner, God willing. I hope to go on to tell you something more about that as it's unfolded
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:42.980]   here next Sunday evening, but it's all here in picture before us. You see, God has so
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:48.420]   loved you that he sent his only son into this world, even to the death of the cross. His
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:55.300]   body was broken, his blood was shed, that you and I might be forgiven, might be lifted
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:04.420]   out of our failure and our shame and might become the sons of God. Thank God for the
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:11.740]   gospel which is the power of God unto salvation. Amen.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
