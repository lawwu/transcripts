[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   In this day and age I constantly see people talking, "Oh, you know, today people just want
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.760]   more benefits, more work-life balance, all this stuff."
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.280]   I think work-life balance is really hard if you want to be really successful.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.040]   Again, really successful.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.080]   That doesn't mean that it's bad to not be really successful, I'm not saying that,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.320]   but it's really hard to have a work-life balance if you want to be really successful.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.400]   You can get the leisure time after you're successful.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680]   And by the way, success isn't money, it's excelling in whatever you do.
