[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Well, we should dream big in our service for God and the church.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.040]   Ambition is a necessary part of the church's mission in the world and that includes our
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.200]   own big lofty goals.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.880]   But how do we guard against those lofty plans really just being an expression of our own
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   self-aggrandizement?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.160]   Here's a specific question from a listener named Natalie.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   "Hello, Pastor Jon.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.480]   I hear a lot of Christians today talking about having big dreams and dreaming big for God.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.000]   In light of God's sovereignty, how do I think about this?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.280]   I don't want to use God's sovereignty as an excuse to not work hard and achieve all I
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.200]   can, but how do the concepts of having big dreams and waiting for God's plan work together?"
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.160]   Seems to me that the concern behind this question is that our ego in the pursuit of big dreams,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:00.640]   we may be so eager in that pursuit that we try to make a name for ourselves and either
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.160]   miss God's plan for us or maybe fail to rely on God's power in us.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.720]   So at root, I think Natalie is saying there's a possible ego issue here.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   But here's the catch.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.400]   This is so helpful to me to realize.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.180]   Here's the catch.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.960]   Whether you have no dreams, cautious dreams, or big dreams, there's always an ego question,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.680]   an ego battle.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.340]   You can't escape it by choosing small dreams.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.420]   If you have big dreams, this may be owing to ego exhibition.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.520]   If you have cautious, careful dreams, this may be owing to ego protection.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.480]   And if you have no dreams, this may be owing to ego paralysis.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.160]   And in every one of those cases, it's an expression of pride, not just the first.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.420]   We often don't recognize pride in the wallflower who hides in the corner, doesn't put herself
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.640]   or himself forward at all, when in fact, the withdrawn person who looks humble may be just
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.620]   as consumed with concern for ego as the guy who's out there in the middle of the floor
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.740]   attracting everybody's attention to stroke his ego.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.140]   They may be exactly equal proud people in God's eyes.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.140]   Here's the illustration.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.980]   When I was just starting out in my academic career at age 28, I had some big dreams about
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.540]   making a contribution academically to the discipline of academic New Testament studies.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:53.820]   So I wrote two or three hard academic technical articles and published them in big shot journals.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.000]   And then after a while, I feared that maybe I was being motivated by ego exhibition.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.020]   So I said to myself, "Okay, got to watch out for that.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.340]   I'm going to stop that at least for a season and devote all my energies to being the best
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.060]   teacher I can be for these students and serve them well."
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.860]   Well, do you know what I discovered?
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.420]   The battle with pride did not go away.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.060]   It just shifted onto a new battlefield.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.980]   Now I found out that I could get high student evaluations if I taught in a certain way.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.420]   So the very same question had to be faced.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.420]   Was I teaching for the sake of ego exhibition or for the good of the students and the glory
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.420]   of God?
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.940]   And what I realized was that no matter whether you're a public figure or a private figure,
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.180]   the battle rages.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.340]   We're proud, selfish, fallen, corrupt, ego-protecting, ego-exhibiting people, all of us, all the
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.780]   time, without the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.120]   And so I made a choice to put writing back into my life, not because there was no danger
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.660]   of pride there, but because there was a danger of pride everywhere and there was no escaping
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.660]   it.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.900]   And in writing, I thought I could do the most good.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.980]   So that's where the fight and the monster would happen.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.340]   So what's the answer to whether we should have big dreams or not?
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.580]   Let's just take the Apostle Paul as an example.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:44.140]   Paul said, Romans 15, 20, "I make it my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ has not
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.260]   already been named, lest I build on anyone's foundation.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.220]   And now since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, since I have longed
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:01.100]   for many years to come to you, I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain."
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.980]   So Paul was a driven man.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.940]   Christ had given him a mission, and he poured his life into it.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.500]   He would reach as far and as many Christless places and peoples as he could.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.460]   He was going to Spain.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.180]   Who knows what might happen in Spain with those barbarians?
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.620]   And that's where he was going.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.860]   And he tells the rest of us that in view of the resurrection of Jesus and our own resurrection
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.900]   and how every sorrow and every pain and every inconvenience will be rewarded a thousand
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.700]   fold in 1 Corinthians 15, 58, "Therefore, be steadfast, immovable, always," and here
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.900]   comes this phrase, "abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.900]   labor is not in vain."
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.900]   What does that mean?
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.820]   Man, I have thought so much about this phrase, "abounding in the work."
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.820]   You know what that means?
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.420]   Lots of work.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.940]   Lots and lots and lots and lots of work.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.740]   That's what "abounding in the work of the Lord" means.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.660]   It means lots of work, and that's a big dream.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:24.620]   The key to whether that lots of work is going to be an exhibition of ego or deep reliance
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:33.380]   on Jesus is found in 1 Corinthians 15, 10, where Paul says, "By the grace of God, I
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.580]   am what I am.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.420]   His grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.980]   On the contrary, I worked harder."
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.460]   So that's that "abounding in lots and lots of work."
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.500]   I worked harder than any of them, "though it was not I, but the grace of God that was
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.820]   with me."
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.940]   So my response is, go ahead.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.980]   Dream your big dream.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:07.500]   Do your work, lots and lots of it, but never, never presume that you're doing it on your
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.980]   own.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.780]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.740]   1 Corinthians 4, 7.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.900]   What if you received it?
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.260]   Why do you boast as though it were not a gift?
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.920]   Every dream is a gift.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.020]   Every accomplishment of a dream is a gift.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.060]   And when we get to the end of life, we are going to say, I hope we're going to say,
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:37.820]   with Martin Luther on his deathbed, last words out of his mouth, "Wir sind betler deses
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.900]   wahr."
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.300]   We are beggars.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.300]   That is true.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   Wow.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.300]   That is true.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.300]   Excellent question, Natalie.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.540]   Thanks for sending it in to us.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.860]   And as you can hear, we're still working through some audio issues on Pastor John's, and I
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.220]   thank you for your patience as we work through it.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.980]   Next week, we have a couple of really good questions.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.620]   The first one is, "Would God want me if his glory was not on the line in me?
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.500]   Would he want me for me?"
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.380]   And then we have a number of emails from moms of newborns who want care for their own souls,
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.420]   as they're called to care for this new, dependent, and draining newborn infant.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.720]   And Pastor John has some thoughts on soul care for new moms.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.740]   Until then, subscribe to our audio podcast and find our feeds and search our episode
