[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.380]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.060]   My guest today is Dr. Craig Conover.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.980]   Dr. Craig Conover is a medical doctor
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.040]   who did his training at Brown University
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.200]   and Thomas Jefferson University.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.280]   He is a world expert in what he refers to
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   as performance medicine,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.760]   which involves the use of peptides and other therapies
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.000]   for improving mental health,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160]   physical health, and performance.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.080]   Now, many of you have perhaps heard of peptide therapies.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.520]   Perhaps some of you have not.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.600]   A peptide is simply a small protein,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.400]   so insulin is a peptide.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800]   We have many different thousands of peptides
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.920]   in our brain and body,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.180]   and they perform a variety of different roles.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.260]   Dr. Conover's expertise is in the use of exogenous,
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.480]   that is, peptides that one takes,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.220]   exogenous peptides for activating multiple pathways
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.360]   in the brain and body to augment health.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.080]   Now, of course, peptides such as insulin
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.840]   have been used for many years now
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600]   to treat things like diabetes,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.800]   but today we talk about novel peptides, including GLP-1.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.640]   So these are glucagon-like peptide analogs,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.300]   things like Ozempic and Munjaro,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400]   which I realize are a bit controversial.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.920]   However, today we talk about the microdosing
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.760]   of those peptides.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.200]   We talk about those peptides combined with other peptides,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.860]   as well as behavioral practices
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.360]   to offset the muscle loss associated with them.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.420]   And then we dive into some lesser-known peptides,
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.820]   but ones that are growing in use.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.820]   For instance, BPC-157, or body protection compound 157,
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060]   which is used to treat inflammation,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.620]   to accelerate wound healing, and a variety of other things.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.180]   Then we discuss the use of peptides
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.020]   specifically to increase growth hormone secretion
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.420]   during sleep, as well as some peptides
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660]   that can actually increase rapid eye movement
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.220]   sleep dramatically.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.480]   Today, we also discuss testosterone therapies,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.300]   not just for men, but for women.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.340]   These are growing increasingly popular,
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.260]   as well as things like NAD, as well as specific supplements.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.420]   Dr. Conover, as he will soon tell you,
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.780]   is not a huge proponent of supplements,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.740]   but he does mention several that he feels
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.740]   are of particular use, including things like coenzyme Q10,
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.620]   and some of the methylated B vitamins,
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.020]   and he explains why he takes that stance.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.600]   So today's discussion is really for anybody interested
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.940]   in mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.500]   And the reason I say that
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.900]   is that even if you aren't considering taking peptides
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.780]   or are already taking peptides,
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.200]   peptides and some of these other compounds I've mentioned
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   sit somewhere between doing nothing except diet and exercise,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.100]   supplements, which I sort of see as the next step
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.300]   up the ladder in terms of augmenting your health approaches.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.940]   And then of course, there are a number of prescription drugs
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.560]   including hormone therapies,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.040]   such as growth hormone therapies, testosterone therapies,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.500]   and a number of other things that,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.860]   yes, can modify those hormone pathways,
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.180]   they are in fact hormones,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.640]   but they actually can shut down one's natural production
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.420]   of those hormone pathways.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.680]   Peptide therapy sits somewhere between
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.300]   doing nothing and supplementation
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.400]   and those more advanced hormone therapies.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.660]   And that's why peptide therapies, I believe,
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.100]   are growing in popularity.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.840]   They can augment specific hormone pathways.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.960]   They can augment specific, in fact, multiple processes
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.220]   within the brain and body to augment health,
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.080]   but they don't tend to operate
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.700]   in that negative feedback cycle
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.580]   by shutting down one's own endogenous production.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.980]   Now, that doesn't mean that they aren't
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.500]   without some safety concerns.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.340]   And today we, of course, discuss the potential side effects
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.980]   and safety concerns of peptides,
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.740]   as well as the critical issue of sourcing clean peptides
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.180]   and working with a board certified physician
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.820]   if one is going to pursue peptide use.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.380]   So by the end of today's discussion,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.180]   you will be right there on the cutting edge
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.860]   of what's happening and where things are going with peptides.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.240]   And in keeping with that,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.140]   you'll notice that during today's discussion,
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.100]   we talk a fair amount about what the FDA currently allows
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.260]   in terms of prescription peptides,
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.240]   what the FDA has recently removed from the market
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.580]   in terms of peptides.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.500]   And as a very recent update,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.660]   just prior to the release of this episode,
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.220]   I learned that three peptides, CJC1295, ipamiralin,
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.060]   both of which are in the growth hormone secretogog family,
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.900]   meaning they promote the release of growth hormone,
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.440]   as well as thymosin beta-alpha,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.500]   which is in the sort of anti-inflammatory
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.300]   and tissue repair pathway,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.940]   those three are now re-allowed
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.200]   for prescription in the United States.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.380]   So at the time of recording this episode,
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.980]   we discussed some of those as being recently banned
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.820]   by the FDA.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.660]   They are now approved again for use in humans by the FDA.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.500]   So there's a brief and very recent update.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.180]   So just to summarize this admittedly long introduction,
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.260]   today you're going to learn about this incredible area
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.280]   of science called peptide biology
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.740]   and how it can augment mental health, physical health,
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.740]   and performance, and you're going to do so
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.540]   from one of the world's leading clinical experts.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.360]   Before you begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.300]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.900]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.060]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.980]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.960]   about science and science-related tools
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.300]   to the general public.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.940]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.900]   Our first sponsor is Juve.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.180]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.020]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.580]   that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.020]   it is the incredible impact
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.080]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.320]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.620]   red light and near infrared light sources
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.480]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.220]   on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health,
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.100]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.280]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.500]   improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.740]   even mitochondrial function, and improving vision itself.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.060]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.660]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.680]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.940]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.140]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.920]   to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.080]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.660]   about three to four times a week,
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.500]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.680]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.780]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.620]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.460]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.140]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.740]   with up to $400 off Juve products.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.240]   Again, that's Juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.180]   to get up to $400 off.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.060]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.080]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.880]   Therapy is an extremely important component
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.000]   to overall health.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.980]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.560]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.400]   including cardiovascular exercise
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.480]   and resistance training exercise.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.840]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.160]   that great therapy provides.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.080]   First, it provides a good rapport
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.580]   with somebody that you can really trust
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.660]   and talk to about any and all issues that concern you.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.060]   Second of all, great therapy provides support
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.740]   in the form of emotional support,
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.180]   but also directed guidance, the dos and the not to dos.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.140]   And third, expert therapy can help you arrive
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.220]   at useful insights
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.660]   that you would not have arrived at otherwise,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.580]   insights that allow you to do better,
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.220]   not just in your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.860]   but also the relationship to yourself
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.700]   and your professional life and all sorts of career goals.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.240]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.480]   to find an expert therapist
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.080]   with whom you can really resonate with
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.600]   and provide you with these three benefits that I described.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.680]   Also, because BetterHelp is carried out entirely online,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.880]   it's very time efficient
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.000]   and easy to fit into a busy schedule
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.800]   with no commuting to a therapist's office
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.640]   or sitting in a waiting room or looking for a parking spot.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.280]   So if you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.680]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman

[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.460]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Craig Conover.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.940]   Dr. Craig Conover, welcome.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.780]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.060]   I appreciate the invitation to be here.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.300]   - I'm thrilled that you're here.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.540]   We are going to launch ourselves
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.260]   into the space that is called peptides.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.420]   And it's an interesting space.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.260]   - For sure.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.380]   - Because I think most people
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.260]   probably don't know what a peptide is.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.780]   They should feel no guilt or shame about that.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.620]   I'm sure you'll tell us.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.760]   But this area of medicine
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.360]   that people broadly refer to as peptides
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.480]   is picking up a lot of momentum,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.920]   even though it's been around for a long time.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.960]   And I find it particularly interesting
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.600]   because there are many people using peptides
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.840]   for very specific purposes,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.800]   but most people haven't really heard
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.200]   of the various peptides that are out there.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   And if anything, we can be sure that in the years to come,
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.940]   peptides are going to be increasingly popular.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.780]   - I totally agree.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.600]   - And there's, of course,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   the incredibly popular peptide of GLP-1 agonists.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.880]   - For sure, taking over.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.020]   - So to drop into this
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.700]   and make sure everyone's on the same page,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.620]   what is a peptide?
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.140]   - Yeah, I mean, just from a very elementary level,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.340]   peptides are just chains of amino acids.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.180]   So amino acids, all naturally occurring molecules.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.320]   We call it a peptide if it's 40 amino acids or less,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.600]   call it a protein if it's 41 amino acids or more.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.920]   The body makes, I think last I read, 300,000 peptides.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.200]   So it's a massive number.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.280]   We probably therapeutically are using
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.840]   closer to 150 over the years,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.100]   which is obviously tiny compared to that.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.560]   So to your point, this is blossoming.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.480]   We've been using peptides for about eight years,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.120]   a long time, but still very early
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.680]   in our understanding of how best to use peptides
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.800]   and how clinically we're gonna get the most out of them.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.920]   So it's exciting.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.120]   - Maybe just to orient ourselves,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.200]   we should talk about GLP-1 first,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.520]   not because it's necessarily the category of peptides
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   that I think people would want to consider for themselves,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.040]   but because most people have probably heard
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.760]   of semi-glutide and Munjaro and things like that.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.600]   - Sure.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.520]   - So how long ago was it that humans started injecting
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.000]   GLP-1 agonists in order to lose weight?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.840]   - I think the weight loss aspect
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.080]   has only been a couple of years.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.000]   I mean, it's been tremendous how it's accelerated
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.460]   to literally becoming the number one prescribed in America.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.620]   Semi-glutide ozempic was approved longer than that
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.120]   for four type two diabetics, helping with glucose control
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.200]   and helping with glucose utilization.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.360]   And what they found as a side effect
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.440]   was that these people were losing weight.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.720]   And then that word caught on.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.960]   And what's interesting,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.240]   and I don't think most people understand this,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.040]   most of the medicines prescribed, particularly in America,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   are prescribed off-label,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.220]   meaning they've never, ever been approved
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.060]   for what they're used.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.040]   - Is that right?
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.840]   - Yeah, the vast majority, yeah, are never approved.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.100]   So as a physician, I'm allowed to prescribe any drug
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.400]   for any reason I want,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.360]   as long as it's been approved for something, right?
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.960]   As long as we're safe, right?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.200]   We don't wanna be cavalier about this
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.920]   and renegade and do all these things
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.420]   that are out of bounds.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.480]   But that is the truth.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.120]   So semi-glutide's a great example
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.560]   being used for helping people,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.680]   diabetics, type two diabetics, lower their blood sugar.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.520]   And then it got to,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.960]   well, now let's help diabetics lose weight, right?
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.280]   Because diabetics struggle with weight,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.760]   the insulin resistance.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   And then it became, well, even if you're not a diabetic,
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.920]   could you benefit from losing weight?
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.360]   Well, heck yeah, right?
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.440]   I mean, look at the amount of obesity
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.280]   in people who are overweight
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.080]   and having trouble maintaining a healthy weight.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.560]   It's exorbitant in this country and certainly worldwide.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.020]   So then it spread.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.020]   It did eventually get FDA approval
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.420]   specifically for weight loss.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.280]   But at first, no, it's been just for type two diabetics
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.740]   to help with glucose utilization.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.400]   And we've been using primarily terzepatide,
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.040]   which is like semi-glutide version 2.0,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.600]   mostly for the past two years,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.720]   have learned a tremendous amount.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.200]   And my opinion's actually changed from working with people.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.080]   - Yeah, what is your opinion?
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.320]   My understanding is that,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.840]   well, there's sort of two camps on this, it seems.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.960]   At least two camps.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.480]   One camp seems really bullish on this.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.600]   They seem very excited about this drug.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.360]   The other camp seems to point to the fact
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.320]   that one may be creating a drug dependency,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.000]   that it's very expensive.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.920]   And they point to the also potency of lifestyle factors
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.120]   like exercise and caloric restriction,
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.360]   eating mostly non-processed foods, et cetera,
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.520]   as a "better alternative."
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.800]   I'm not necessarily saying that.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.000]   I think they both have their place.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.520]   To me, it seems very contextual.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.480]   But as a clinician, I'm curious what you think.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.320]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.560]   Both have their place.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   My philosophy is I want everyone to have access
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.520]   to things that are, number one, safe,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.960]   that propel them to look, feel, and perform their best.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.920]   And if that means, right, if it was just about,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.720]   if I can exercise my way out of this,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.480]   eat my way out of this, meaning lose weight,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.120]   change my body composition,
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.600]   why do we have an epidemic of so many people
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.200]   who struggle with that?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.560]   'Cause it's really hard, right?
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.160]   And we don't totally understand it.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.400]   I'm not saying that, yeah,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   the processed food thing's a massive problem.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.440]   I mean, I know that's come to light recently
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.720]   with people pushing for us to take a look
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.320]   at food companies and the quality of our food,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.140]   which is amazing.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.800]   But if people aren't interested
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.400]   in doing better for themselves,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.320]   and this may not make sense, but I think it does,
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.240]   the analogy I use is I like to help people
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.400]   win the race first, which then helps them motivate
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.200]   to train for the next race, right?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.000]   And this kind of goes against the grain
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.840]   of conventional medicine, which is,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.860]   if you wanna train for the race,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.000]   you have to run a certain number of miles,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.840]   you have to sleep a certain way,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.880]   you have to eat a certain way,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.140]   you have to do all the things, struggle to get there, right?
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.400]   And losing weight is a struggle.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   And the way I look at it,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.120]   if I can help people lose weight first,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.360]   literally by using something like terzapotide,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.780]   semaglutide, and I've seen this, they're now excited.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.920]   I mean, I met with a client yesterday here in Los Angeles,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.120]   and she literally looked at me and said,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.640]   "You've changed my life."
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.400]   She goes, "I am a super successful woman in my company,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.300]   "with my family, with my kids.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.560]   "Everything's great, but now I love my life.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.460]   "My workouts are better, I look better,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.320]   "my clothes fit better.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.360]   "I am super excited about waking up every morning."
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.640]   Like, she is there, and that is what it's about, right?
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.480]   And so for people,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.080]   if you can help them achieve their goal first,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.000]   then they're gonna be motivated.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.480]   The light bulb turns on, they're gonna be like,
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.960]   "Wow, I want more of this."
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.400]   And that's the aha moment that I love helping people with.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.960]   So at first, I was like,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.480]   "Oh, we gotta be really cautious with this."
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.440]   Same thinking, like,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.320]   I don't want people to lose too much weight.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.160]   Like, this is a problem.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.040]   Are they gonna be dependent?
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.840]   I'm like the notion that you have to take something
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.380]   the rest of your life.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.760]   And I'm not saying it has to be the rest of your life,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.240]   but when something works,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.680]   and as far as I can tell, it's very safe,
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.320]   I think it's worth discussing.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.960]   And I like people having those options, at least.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.920]   - Yeah, it sounds like from the story you just told us,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.120]   that it's not just about an aesthetic change
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.680]   that motivates people to lean into other aspects
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.120]   of their health and life when they lose some weight,
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   that it's also just the sheer, literal weight,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.080]   and also that adipose tissue, fat tissue,
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.100]   produces a lot of hormones that we know impact the brain
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.620]   and brain function, which is not to say
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.980]   that there aren't people out there
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.260]   with a lot of adipose tissues
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.680]   who aren't extremely bright and motivated, et cetera,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.420]   but many people who are carrying excess body fat
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.580]   don't feel good, they report brain fog, et cetera.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.580]   And I think now, thanks to Chris Palmer,
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.420]   and actually at Stanford,
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.380]   there's also a program in metabolic psychiatry,
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.180]   we're starting to see, or understand and appreciate
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   the link between adipose tissue and brain health,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.080]   or lack of brain health in most cases.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.920]   - Sure.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.600]   - So in the case of GLP-1,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.040]   people have criticized it,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.560]   saying that a fair percentage of the weight that's lost
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.520]   is lean body mass, muscle loss.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.440]   But it seems to me that can be remedied pretty easily
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.480]   if people just do some resistance training.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.800]   - I think part of that, yeah, resistance training.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.420]   The other thing I would say is from what we've seen
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.220]   is when people are using the conventional dosages,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.400]   they're losing weight too quickly.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.000]   And so what we do is we get both semi-glutide,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.960]   mostly terzapatide compounded,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.400]   and that allows us to use basically micro dosages,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.440]   and start very low in terms of dosage
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.760]   and go slowly with people.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.840]   And what we found is as long as people are losing
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.880]   less two pounds or less a week,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.120]   they're not losing the muscle mass.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.760]   We certainly encourage adequate protein intake,
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.240]   resistance training, but that micro dosing
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.980]   has been a game-changer, literally a game-changer,
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.180]   because then people don't feel like,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.740]   and I've seen it where when we started,
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.900]   people were losing 15 pounds in three weeks.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.740]   - Goodness.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.260]   - And then they're excited, but then they're not,
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.100]   'cause then they come off of it
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.420]   and they just gain it right back.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.340]   Or they lose a lot of weight
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.740]   and they lose that fat in their face,
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.780]   and they look like skeletons.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.300]   We've seen those called ozempic faces.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.180]   We don't like the way that looks,
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.900]   and that fat takes a while to come back.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.920]   So if we just go slowly with this,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.940]   and we can really dial it in and nuance it,
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.720]   that has had a tremendous impact.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.760]   And now, beyond the weight loss,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.680]   we're seeing cognitive benefits.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.520]   We're seeing inflammation benefits.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.400]   A lot of people with autoimmune disease,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.600]   who their inflammation markers are coming down,
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.240]   and that's the only thing we can think is working.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   - Is that a direct effect of ozempic on the immune system
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.940]   and pathways related to inflammation,
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.560]   or is it indirect through the loss of adipose tissue,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.620]   body fat, which then lowers inflammation?
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.460]   - Great question.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.100]   Or I could say, is it the positive thoughts
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.540]   that come from looking at yourself in the mirror
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.020]   and feeling good, right?
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.540]   Which transcends to feeling better about yourself,
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.180]   and that feeds forward to the momentum
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.740]   that you put forth in the world.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.580]   All of those things.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.080]   I think it's all of the above.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.900]   You know, I think that's gonna be hard to dissect,
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.740]   but it's real.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.460]   I mean, I have a patient, she's 50.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.540]   She has Hashimoto's thyroiditis,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.020]   meaning she attacks her thyroid.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.940]   She doesn't make enough thyroid hormones,
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.060]   so she takes thyroid hormone.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.380]   Well, one of the challenges with that
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.220]   is they make a lot of thyroid antibodies,
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.580]   this antibody called thyroid peroxidase antibody.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.940]   And when you have an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody,
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.760]   you don't feel good.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.380]   You feel inflamed, your joints hurt, you get rashes.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.520]   Life is just not easy.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.580]   And it's a challenge to get that number down.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.140]   I mean, it's certainly a challenge for me.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.420]   You know, we traditionally use probiotics,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.060]   a lot of things to help bolster the immune system.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.500]   Well, now we're starting to use the GLP-1s,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.500]   and we're seeing that those antibody levels come down.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.020]   And I don't have a great way of explaining it,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.440]   but there's something going on that's very positive.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.940]   - Very interesting.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.620]   Well, I suppose moving from most widely known,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.140]   peptides are still fairly unknown to most people,
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.600]   even the concept, but that's why you're here.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.740]   You're changing that right now.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.340]   But moving from things like GLP-1
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.780]   to what I would probably call
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.780]   the second most popular peptide,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.580]   the one that we're hearing more and more about all the time,
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.560]   and that's BPC-157, body protection compound 157,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:17.260]   which to my understanding, there are a lot of animal data,
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.100]   very few, if any, clinical studies on humans,
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.180]   but a lot of people now taking BPC in various forms.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.880]   What are some known uses for BPC,
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.900]   let's just say within your clinic,
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.580]   and then we'll get around to the fact that BPC has,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.420]   let's hope temporarily been taken off market,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.040]   and what some of the alternatives are,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.100]   but what is BPC?
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.740]   What instances or people have you found it useful for?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.580]   - So many.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.980]   So I think with BPC, for me,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.500]   kind of the most utilized peptide that we've used.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.420]   So we'd like to use BPC almost with every patient.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.860]   It is very anti-inflammatory, right?
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.100]   And so just from a very general perspective,
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.900]   most people walking around who are adults,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.700]   they're stiff, they're sores, they get older, they work out.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.820]   We work with athletes of all levels.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.080]   There's that element of inflammation.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.660]   Maybe they have some chronic disease,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.680]   diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disease.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.140]   Inflammation is paramount, we understand that.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.060]   And BPC, I observe with so many patients,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.340]   we're talking thousands upon thousands of patients,
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.640]   where their inflammation comes down, so they feel better.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.940]   They're not as stiff, they're not as sore,
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.940]   their knee doesn't hurt as much, their shoulder's improved.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.260]   So we've learned that we start with a dose
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.320]   based upon these, like you said, animal studies,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.420]   which is conservative, make sure it's safe.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.220]   And then we've seen over time that we can get
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.820]   to higher and higher dosages
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.780]   and have even more of an impact, you know?
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.020]   And I think, so for people understanding using BPC,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.220]   we started with a dose of like 500 micrograms a day.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.140]   We got up to 5,000 micrograms a day, you know?
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.780]   And we'd like a protocol five days on, two days off.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.480]   And that's been very helpful for a variety of things
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.900]   from post-viral, you know, with the pandemic.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.780]   We've had a lot of success with BPC, to again, you name it.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.420]   Honestly, almost everyone I could think of,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.780]   particularly as people are engaging
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.620]   more fitness-related lives, they're working out more.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.740]   I would argue that anyone who's working out
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.540]   on a regular basis, BPC is gonna benefit.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.820]   It's gonna help, you know, improve the inflammatory status,
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.260]   but also help with recovery.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.140]   And it doesn't seem to be one of these agents
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.340]   that's gonna be detrimental.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.620]   Like we were talking earlier, Rob and I, for the starter,
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.520]   like, you know, they found that people
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.260]   are working out hard taking antioxidants,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.580]   that there seems to be a negative consequence to that
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.400]   because you don't allow the body to kind of repair itself.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.240]   I don't think that's happening with BPC.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.100]   - That's interesting because my understanding
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:48.060]   is also that part of the specific and general adaptation
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.540]   of exercise is triggered by inflammation.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.380]   This is why indeed it is true that doing ice bath
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.580]   or really cold water immersion, cold shower seems fine,
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.940]   but cold water immersion in the, you know,
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.060]   four to eight hours after resistance training
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.300]   can limit some of the hypertrophy and strength gains
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.060]   from resistance training, because what you're inducing
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.220]   when you actually go into the gym
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.780]   is that leads to the hypertrophy and strength training
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.300]   is an inflammation response
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.940]   that triggers the compensation or the hyper compensation.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.120]   So it's interesting, you're saying that BPC,
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.540]   by the way, I must say this because then,
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.500]   forgive the editorial, but that is not to say
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.140]   that cold plunges and cold immersion is bad.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.020]   It's just in the hours following resistance training,
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.100]   specifically for hypertrophy and strength training.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.540]   If those are your goals,
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.820]   probably best to do it outside of that window.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.780]   Other times it has some tremendous benefits.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.300]   Be safe, but there.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.560]   Okay, back to the topic again, forgive me,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   but this can set off a complicated storm of sorts
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.500]   if I'm not ultra clear about the details.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.300]   BPC-157, strongly anti-inflammatory.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.220]   My understanding is it also may up-regulate
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.460]   growth hormone receptors.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.020]   - It does, right, and so it works well
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.420]   if you're, you know, we'll get into taking
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.140]   a growth hormone-releasing peptide.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.380]   It pairs very well with that,
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.940]   'cause then you're working both sides of the equation,
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.460]   meaning if you're using a growth hormone-releasing peptide
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.740]   like semirelin or ipermirelin, GHRP6, whatever,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.620]   you're helping your pituitary put out more growth hormone.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.940]   Well, if you combine it with BPC,
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.780]   which up-regulates the growth hormone receptor,
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.820]   you make the process of growth hormone binding
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.620]   more efficient, so you get more out of it.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.800]   Then you can use less of the growth hormone-releasing peptide
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.220]   with the same result.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.180]   - Got it.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.660]   BPC-157 comes in many different forms,
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.660]   or it used to when it was FDA not disallowed.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.180]   So I could imagine how the oral forms
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:45.180]   would allow for a just general anti-inflammatory response.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.100]   It's a gut peptide, so we don't have to worry
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.460]   about it being destroyed by the gut.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.620]   Most peptides that go into the gut are broken down.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.460]   - Correct.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.100]   - But this peptide, when it's naturally occurring,
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.700]   occurs in the gut, so it survives in the gut.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.800]   So if somebody is taking BPC-157 orally
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.740]   through a capsule or tablet form,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:08.100]   my guess is that has a general anti-inflammation response.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.260]   - I think it can.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.580]   What we've observed is it's more limited to the gut.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.580]   So people with any sort of gastrointestinal issue,
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.100]   whether that's inflammatory bowel disease
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.480]   like Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.660]   you name it, leaky gut,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.740]   I think oral BPC is more effective there.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.220]   - Has it been shown to be effective for those conditions
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.980]   or have you observed that clinically?
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.780]   - I've certainly observed that clinically,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.980]   but interestingly, I've observed a better clinical response
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.400]   when people inject it,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.840]   even for gastrointestinal related things.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.380]   So I think injecting, and then,
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.660]   so people injecting Sub-Q, which is right under the skin,
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.300]   we use the tiniest of needles, like an insulin needle,
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.100]   30 or 31 gauge, we're talking super small.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.520]   And so I know a lot of people are like,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.360]   "I'm never injecting one of these."
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.860]   - Yeah, this is less painful than a Texas mosquito bite.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.700]   - There you go.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.900]   It's super easy, once you do it once or twice,
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.980]   it's really easy, and we walk people how to do that.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.020]   But interestingly, we started thinking,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.460]   okay, if you've got something going on in your gut,
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.540]   you should take oral BPC
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.780]   'cause it's gonna target it right then.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.480]   And I found, you know, if we're injecting,
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   it actually works better than the oral.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.340]   And then that came up,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.020]   well, what if I've got an elbow injury,
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.060]   should I inject it in my elbow?
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.300]   And we found, actually, don't,
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.420]   it's gonna work systemically.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.380]   You can inject it in your abdomen or your rear end,
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.900]   you're still gonna get benefit in your elbow,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.220]   but now you're gonna get benefit in all your joints,
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.260]   all over your body, systemically.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.340]   - How do you think that's working?
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.620]   And my understanding is BPC-157
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   can initiate fibroblast migration,
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.860]   some of the cells that make up
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:33.860]   the various connective tissues that when injured or sore,
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.760]   other things can make us injured or sore, of course,
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.540]   but when injured or sore, those need repair.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.340]   So it always was perplexing to me
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.060]   why one could put BPC-157 in such a small volume
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.140]   under the skin, you know,
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.000]   just a few centimeters off the belly button,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   and it would somehow seek out the injury site
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.860]   in an elbow or an Achilles.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.480]   And there are all these wild anecdotal tales of,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.820]   you know, lore of, let's just say,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.400]   there was this Olympic athlete, not this last Olympics,
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.600]   but the previous summer Olympics,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.720]   that had a torn Achilles who came back a few weeks later
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.520]   and everyone was, and meddled.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.240]   People were talking about, you know, took podium, that is,
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.120]   and people were talking about BPC-157.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.440]   There was kind of this, you know,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.120]   and who knows, that's just a chatter and fog, as they say,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.200]   but kind of wild,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.160]   the idea that you could just inject something systemically,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.760]   put into the systemic circulation, into the bloodstream,
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.280]   and it would ferret out the location
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.520]   in which the injury took place
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.620]   and initiate a recovery response.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.520]   - But we've seen it with, not to get off topic,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.280]   but we've seen it with stem cells.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.840]   So they've taken stem cells,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.360]   they've tagged them radiographically so you can see them.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.000]   And the study I read, which I can find for you,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.240]   someone had a wrist, broken wrist,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.920]   and they gave them intravenous stem cells.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   And 24 hours later, when they visualized radiographically,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.880]   those stem cells had aggregated
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.840]   at the site of the fracture.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.520]   So there's a lot, you know, about our bodies.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.320]   Obviously, we don't know that there's a kind of innate
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.600]   human-like design and intelligence, which I believe in.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.360]   I see it 'cause we've done a lot of IV therapy
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.440]   over the years, and you, you know,
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.320]   it's interesting when you give something intravenously,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.720]   you're getting in the bloodstream,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.680]   and you can feel some of these different compounds,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.160]   we're just talking about vitamins, working within seconds.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.640]   And it shows you how quickly things circulate.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.480]   People don't understand like how quickly
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.160]   we move our circulation.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.720]   It's massively fast.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.160]   - One has ever gone into the hospital for a surgery
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.840]   and got a cold saline infusion.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.680]   - Yeah.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.440]   - You realize how quickly it hits your toes.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.840]   You know, they're putting it in at your elbow.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.680]   - It's almost instantaneous.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.640]   - Yeah, within a few seconds.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.000]   It also makes one appreciate how we're all generally
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.040]   a little bit dehydrated.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.160]   When you start getting a real proper saline infusion,
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.040]   all of a sudden you feel yourself come to life in a way
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.080]   that, oh, this is what it feels like to have
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.600]   just the right amount of salt in my bloodstream.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.440]   - Exactly.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.900]   So going back to BPC, where I think it shines
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.240]   is in these ligaments and tendons, right?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.400]   I think this is where most of these injuries happen
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.720]   is where muscle is connecting to the bone.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.640]   You know, and there's, you know, people, you know,
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.240]   grow their muscle, but we don't stretch the tendons
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.480]   and ligaments well, and that's where we get pull,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.680]   sometimes strain, sprain, and tearing.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.040]   And I think that's where BPC shine.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.120]   That's certainly where it's been studied in animal studies.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.240]   And I know that because we can inject it directly
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.900]   into tendons, which is unlike steroids.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.760]   We would never inject steroids into a tendon.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.280]   You damage the tendon.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.640]   BPC, we mix with things like PRP, PRF,
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.760]   which is platelet-rich fiber
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.680]   and a little bit different than PRP,
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.480]   and you'll get healing within days.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.840]   Like, it's awesome.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.680]   - Wow.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.760]   - Super safe, and it's amazing for people.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.920]   - BPC is definitely shorthand for BPC-157, that is,
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.800]   is certainly in widespread use.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.960]   I have been concerned, just personally,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.240]   about gray market sources that contain contaminants
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.480]   and the fact that many people are obtaining BPC-157,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.600]   not from a physician, not from a compounded pharmacy,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.360]   but just kind of on, quote unquote, on the internet.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.200]   - Sure.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.040]   - You're a physician.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.680]   I'm guessing that until the recent ban by the FDA,
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.080]   you were able to prescribe clean BPC, as it were.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.920]   - Yeah.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.360]   - What's the story with BPC now?
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.120]   And maybe we could talk about gray market.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.960]   - Sure.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.780]   - Versus-
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.620]   - I think it's a great question.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.360]   - You know, versus prescribed
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.320]   and made it a compounding pharmacy
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.680]   versus a pharmaceutical company, pharmaceuticals.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.080]   So, and then of course there's black market,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.320]   but let's just leave that out.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.160]   - Sure.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.040]   - You know, there are people that are going to tell you,
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.640]   hey, this is BPC and sell it to you.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   That's obviously bad and dangerous.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.120]   - Well, we see that with the anabolic steroids, right?
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.360]   Like, so anabolic steroids are in the black market.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.000]   You can't really, I mean, there's one anabolic steroid,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.280]   which is Nandrolone, which is Deca,
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.320]   which can be officially prescribed.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.560]   We use it, you can combine it with testosterone,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.560]   all in the up and up, totally above table.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.600]   The rest, things like Trenbolone, others,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   you can't get them from a physician.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.200]   In fact, it's very hard to get them
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.080]   from a reputable website in the United States.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   - So as long as we're here,
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.120]   my understanding is Decaderobalin
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.760]   and Testosterone Cipionate can be prescribed,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.040]   or Testosterone Enanthate,
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.280]   things like that by physicians.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.480]   That's because it's been FDA approved
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.560]   for the treatment of various things.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.400]   Hypokonadal syndrome,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.720]   Testosterone Replacement Therapy
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.540]   in both men and women, et cetera.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:28.540]   So those categories of testosterone-like compounds,
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.680]   Cipionate, Enanthate, et cetera,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.960]   and Decaderobalin, which is basically like,
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.700]   is it similar to DHT?
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.080]   Is it, go ahead.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.400]   - A little bit, yeah.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.840]   I mean, it's, the generic name is Nandrolone.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.320]   Yeah, I mean, it has the flavor of helping with joints.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.240]   I think it works synergistically
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.480]   with things like testosterone,
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.960]   different, you know, whether it's testosterone,
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.000]   Cipionate, Enanthate.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.600]   And I like it for people who,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.560]   particularly people who've been on testosterone,
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.080]   men who've been on testosterone replacement for a long time,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.040]   which is many men,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.880]   they tend to get less out of testosterone,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.320]   it becomes less potent, like anything, right?
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.620]   If you use something for a long time,
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.920]   you're gonna get less out of it over time.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.240]   Anything you expose yourself to continually
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.880]   doesn't work as well.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.720]   And so, you know, like to make this really real,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.400]   I had a patient who was in the Marines
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.160]   and served at Secret Service for several White Houses,
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.760]   and he had a lot of, you know, osteoporosis,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.300]   osteopenia, you know, bone loss.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.920]   And, you know, this is where I learned
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.360]   about using something like Nandrolone,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.080]   'cause we combined Nandrolone with testosterone,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.200]   it changed his life.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.240]   You know, this guy in his 80s,
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.280]   who had to use a cane, who came back to life,
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.400]   who started, you know, becoming super mobile
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.160]   and working out again.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.280]   And synergistically, I think it works really well,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.880]   not to get too far off topic, but.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.840]   - No, it's interesting.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.480]   And I think another sort of brief editorial for me,
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.840]   if I may, you mentioned this patient was in their 80s.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.320]   I think nowadays, unfortunately,
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.760]   a lot of younger males in particular,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.680]   guys in their, gosh, even teens,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.280]   but 20s and 30s, even early 40s,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.200]   think that they need to look to synthetic testosterones
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.780]   in order to look a certain way,
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.880]   perform a certain way in the gym, libido, et cetera.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.320]   And I'll go on record again and again and again,
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.080]   saying that it's absolutely not necessary
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.640]   for most people of those ages,
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.680]   provided that they are taking good care
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.520]   to sleep well, eat well, take care.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.120]   Now, but I realized that there are
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.880]   a growing number of use cases where people,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.840]   for whatever reason, aren't able to recover from exercise,
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.800]   they're struggling.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.440]   This is a little bit like the ozempic conversation, right?
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.680]   Where there are things that can help move the needle
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.540]   in the right direction, pun intended.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.240]   But here with testosterones,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.320]   synthetic testosterones and DECA,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.240]   there's a real concern about loss of fertility.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.120]   - Totally. - Right?
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.080]   - I think it brings up a larger point, which is,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.680]   and obviously I'm biased,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.800]   but I think it's super helpful for people
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.320]   to have a physician help them in this course,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.940]   particularly with testosterone.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.800]   It is just known that people get it from their trainers,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.480]   their bros from the gym, right?
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.960]   Who are saying, "Oh, you gotta use this."
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.240]   I mean, I have so many patients
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.280]   who started using testosterone in their late teens,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.680]   early 20s. - Goodness.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.160]   - Yeah. - I mean, not goodness,
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.060]   meaning badness.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.900]   That does not seem like a good idea.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.000]   - And it's still very common.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.160]   - Goodness gracious. - It's still very common.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.640]   And, you know, one in particular,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.760]   this is probably 10 years ago,
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.240]   came to see me, he's 25, he got married.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.500]   And to your point, he said, "I'm ready to have kids.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.760]   "I have zero sperm left," right?
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.600]   And that's a real thing.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.420]   And so he had been using, and I would say abusing,
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.560]   both testosterone and growth hormone for years.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.280]   Now, what he told me was, and I get it, he was Superman.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.620]   He could wake up, do a hard workout, you know, crush it,
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.520]   wake up the next morning, was not sore, crush it again,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.200]   and just kept going, kept going, was super fit,
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.380]   super happy in that regard in how he looked,
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.200]   how he felt, how he performed.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.720]   But then he got to a point where he was a little bit wiser,
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.800]   mature, and he was like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.080]   "now there's a repercussion for this."
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.040]   And I've seen that time and time again.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.200]   And the repercussion is big.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   You're not making any sperm,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.540]   and the sperm quality is super poor.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.380]   Now, what do you do?
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.480]   Well, now you gotta come off the testosterone,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.640]   you gotta rebuild your system, which we can do.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.240]   You know, we can use things like clomiphene,
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.880]   menclomiphene, HCG, lots of different agents
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.320]   to help in that regard, even certain peptides.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.920]   But I think it brings up the large point,
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.520]   even getting into peptides,
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.200]   which is having a physician who's knowledgeable,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.400]   to me, is super helpful.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.560]   The challenge for people is they don't know
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.040]   where to get the right information, right?
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.360]   And they're getting it from websites,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.260]   and they're getting it from people saying,
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.640]   "Oh, just try this peptide."
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.840]   And I've had lots of people talking about the, you know,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.640]   websites or whatever, not to name any names,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.180]   who have had anaphylactic reactions
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.080]   to research-type peptides,
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.720]   which are not for human consumption.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   And I'm not saying that they're bad companies or whatever.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.880]   You just gotta be careful.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.680]   You gotta be selective, at least.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.760]   - Right, well, what brought us on
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.200]   to the conversation about testosterone
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.560]   was this black market issue.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.020]   There's also what I would call
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.480]   this dark, dark gray market issue,
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.240]   which is that there are a number of companies
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.200]   that will sell all sorts of things,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.840]   but peptides in particular,
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.000]   and listed on their website,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.400]   it'll say not for human or animal consumption,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.720]   for research purposes only.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.320]   And one of the major issues is that
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.520]   the potency and cleanliness, so to speak,
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.520]   of purity of those compounds is not established.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   And many of them have LPS, lipopolysaccharide in them,
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.560]   which is inflammatory.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.280]   And earlier, before we started recording,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.000]   you mentioned that you have heard of
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.940]   or interacted with, not your patients,
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.960]   but people who have come to you
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.520]   saying that they had like really serious,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.680]   life-threatening consequences
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.900]   for using these black market, certainly,
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.400]   but dark gray market peptides.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.960]   - Yeah, and so to tell the story further
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.080]   is back in October of 2023,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.880]   the FDA put many peptides, BPC,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.120]   and we can name them out,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.240]   on what's called a category two list,
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.840]   meaning they are no longer allowed to be compounded, right?
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.200]   Now, that excludes then research companies
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.560]   who are not under the purview of the FDA,
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.080]   but these compounding pharmacies,
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.640]   it's been a huge blow because they've been told
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.180]   they cannot use these agents.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.040]   - And the compounding pharmacies
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.640]   are distinct from these other black and dark gray sources
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.640]   in that they actually can establish purity,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.760]   they are designed to be injected into humans.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.840]   - And they have a totally different standard, right?
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.240]   So they, and I think it's confusing
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.640]   for people when they hear compounding pharmacy,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.320]   they thought fringe, they're not fringe,
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.360]   they're FDA regulated,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.520]   they're Board of Pharmacy regulated in every state.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.200]   They are monitored, they are inspected all the time.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.740]   I've worked with compounding pharmacies my whole career,
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.920]   which is going on close to 25 years now.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.760]   Just like anything,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.640]   there's some amazing compounding pharmacies
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.000]   and there's some not so amazing compounding pharmacies,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.840]   which cut corners.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.920]   The ones we work with don't cut any corners.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.800]   And I know that 'cause they're inspected all the time, right?
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.440]   And it's a big deal to them.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.160]   And they wanna do it right with purity, with processing,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.560]   and making sure that anything they make,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.040]   especially a sterile compound,
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.760]   which is gonna be anything injected,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.720]   you know, eye drops, things you inject in yourself,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.000]   whether it's IV, sub-Q, or intramuscular,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.360]   they're considered sterile.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.460]   They have to then be tested by an outside lab
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.000]   to make sure purity,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.720]   make sure that there's no endotoxins, things like that.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.320]   It's highly regulated and it's a big deal for them.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.720]   And it's a big deal for the physicians
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.600]   who prescribe with them,
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.480]   which I appreciate because the advantage
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.560]   of a compounding pharmacy is we can tweak the dosage.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.760]   We don't have to use a standard set dosage.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.740]   We can combine things synergistically
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.040]   to get one plus one doesn't equal two now, it equals four.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.840]   And that, to me, is a huge advantage,
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.200]   just like we were talking about with the GLP-1,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.360]   semi-glutide in terms of epitides.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.040]   We get those compounded so that we have a,
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.100]   the compounding pharmacy we're using now,
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.100]   we're making a unique combination
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.880]   of terzepatide and semirelin, right?
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.440]   Which will address some of this muscle loss
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.360]   that people are getting.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.200]   So we can combine them.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.360]   - So semirelin to stimulate growth hormone release,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.000]   offset some of the muscle loss from--
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.520]   - Exactly. - Terepazide.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.640]   - And so you can do things like that
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.480]   with a compounding pharmacy.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.160]   But again, just to make sure people understand,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.720]   compounding pharmacies are highly regulated,
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.040]   highly regulated.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.580]   Again, there's always gonna be bad apples.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.600]   But physicians who know how to work
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.480]   with compounding pharmacies,
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.740]   I think provide access to things
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.020]   that these conventional, both pharmaceuticals
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.900]   and conventional pharmacies can't.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.140]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.780]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG-1.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.340]   AG-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.460]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.880]   AG-1 is designed to cover
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.980]   all of your foundational nutritional needs,
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.100]   and it tastes great.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.860]   Now, I've been drinking AG-1 since 2012.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.300]   And I started doing that at a time
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.780]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.640]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.960]   to purchase one supplement.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.000]   And I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG-1.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.120]   The reason for that is even though I strive
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   to eat most of my foods from whole foods
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.920]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.900]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.640]   vegetables, vitamins, and minerals,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.800]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.720]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.520]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.960]   I sleep well at night, and keep my immune system strong.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.460]   But when I take AG-1 daily,
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.120]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.800]   my physical health, my mental health,
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.880]   and my performance, both cognitive and physical, are better.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.700]   I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG-1
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.560]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.580]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.640]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.200]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG-1,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.600]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.760]   and again, later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.900]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.360]   If you'd like to try AG-1,
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.460]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.840]   to claim a special offer.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.080]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.640]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.120]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.820]   to claim that special offer.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.960]   - So is it fair to say that if one is interested
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.100]   in exploring the use of peptides
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.440]   for what you refer to as performance medicine,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.280]   mental, physical health, and performance,
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.600]   falls underneath that,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.600]   to essentially only put peptides into their body,
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.100]   maybe even on their body surface
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.140]   that they're obtaining from a physician
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.660]   who's obtained the peptides from a compounding pharmacy?
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.700]   - Yeah, and who's developing a relationship.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.460]   So we, for any peptide that we use,
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.900]   we meet with the patient.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.060]   We make sure they're a good fit.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.100]   We make sure that there's no contraindications.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.220]   We also can recommend
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.840]   and specifically dial it up or down, whatever it is,
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.980]   come up with, this is what we think you should use
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.020]   based upon your life experience,
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.780]   the medicines you're taking or not taking,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.100]   the conditions you're treating or not treating, right?
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.060]   I think that's really important.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.100]   Again, I'm biased being a physician.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.060]   My whole goal is to get to know patients.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.180]   That's why I'm here is to kind of walk that walk
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.340]   and help people in that regard.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.020]   And if someone's out there on the internet
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.820]   doing it themselves,
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.300]   they're walking in kind of on their own.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.740]   And so not to make it like everything bad is gonna happen,
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.460]   but when you have the help of someone who has experience,
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.580]   that goes a long way,
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.460]   I think particularly with something like this.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.500]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.420]   And it worries me very much
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.740]   that people are buying PPC from dark gray market
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.260]   or black market sources.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.540]   I mean, anything that says on it,
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.980]   not for animal or human use for research purposes only,
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:22.900]   you can pretty much guarantee the endotoxin,
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.420]   the lipopolysaccharide at least has not been removed.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.660]   And that could be really problematic,
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.980]   especially since my understanding
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.520]   is that it can be cumulative over time.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.100]   It's not that one injection
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.920]   causes somebody to go into anaphylactic shock.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.100]   It's that some of this LPS
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.020]   can build up an inflammatory response over time.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.380]   And then you don't know where the tipping point is.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.820]   And then somebody can have a really terrible reaction.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.420]   - Well, and then taking a step further,
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.620]   getting away from just peptides.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.060]   But I remember this was, I don't know, 15 years ago,
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.580]   someone was taking advice from a very famous doctor on TV
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.020]   about taking an oral compound to lose weight.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.580]   And they called me up and they said,
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.220]   "I'm having terrible headaches, terrible headaches for days."
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.580]   They came in, their blood pressure was through the roof.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.700]   I don't remember the specific numbers,
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.700]   but let's just say 220 over 140.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.900]   And normally it's 120 over 80.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.380]   Well, did you take anything different?
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.020]   Oh yeah, this doctor recommended
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.420]   I take this weight loss compound, right?
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.540]   So the problem is people have access to all this information
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.340]   but if they're not under the guidance of a doctor
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.140]   to help clean up the mess and we clean up the mess,
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.820]   not that there's always mess,
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.620]   but this is what we enjoy doing, you know,
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.500]   is as a physician, like we've seen the darkest of dark,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.140]   you know, we're able to help people
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.540]   when things don't go perfectly planned.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.540]   And I think that's a big deal, you know,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.180]   particularly when there's lots of these tools
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.500]   and they're exciting tools and they're great tools.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.260]   And fortunately for me,
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.900]   I've been in this space longer than most
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.860]   that I've just, you know,
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.340]   built up a large repertoire of experience
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.060]   of observing people and working with people
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.300]   and seeing we got to tweak this, we got to nuance this,
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.060]   or sometimes we don't ever want to use this again.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.820]   You know, this is not for most people.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.140]   - So given that BPC-157
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:07.140]   has been effectively removed from the legitimate market,
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.540]   what are people's alternatives?
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.020]   Again, working with the caveat
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.940]   that people should work with a physician,
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.220]   where can physicians get something similar enough
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.660]   to BPC-157?
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.220]   - So there's a new compound, newer peptide called,
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.420]   the shortened for PDA, pentadecaarginate.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.300]   It's basically the same molecular structure as BPC,
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.860]   except they've swapped out an acetate for arginate.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.740]   - One amino acid substitution.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.860]   - One amino acid substitution.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:42.580]   And so we're using that and having really good results.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.100]   I certainly, it's early in the game of using PDA,
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.140]   but it seems very close to BPC
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.140]   in the clinical responses we're getting from our patients
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.260]   who are reporting back decrease in inflammation,
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.860]   all these wonderful things that we used to see with BPC.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.760]   So, and I think I surmise that this is going,
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.500]   how it's going to be with all of these peptides, right?
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.700]   Because again, peptides are just chains of amino acids.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   You know, certainly a lot of people smarter than me
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.860]   trying to figure out how do we then create
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.700]   other types of amino acid combinations, you know,
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.940]   i.e. peptides that do similar actions to BPC,
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.060]   to thymosin alpha, to ipamerone, to TB500,
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.340]   on and on and on.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.060]   So I'm hopeful in that regard.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.700]   And I also, you know, some of my patients work
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.460]   at the very highest level of the U.S. government.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.700]   They are well aware of this and who have assured me
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.780]   they're going to look at this, that this is serious,
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.620]   you know, because they've been using peptides
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.420]   and they're concerned that, oh my goodness,
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.060]   the FDA came in and changed the game.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.500]   Very, it's been a huge setback for all of us.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.260]   - I definitely want to circle back
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.820]   as to what the motivation was by the FDA for doing that
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.740]   at some point.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.180]   I think in the meantime, however,
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.620]   I think there's a lot of interest in BPC-157,
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.820]   a lot of use of BPC-157.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.660]   The sources of BPC-157 are now drying up.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.620]   And that's why I'm personally concerned
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.460]   that people are going to start going
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.780]   to the dark gray market and black market.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.700]   I'm excited about the pentadeca arginate.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.820]   So let's put that on people's ear map, brain map.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.500]   Pentadeca arginate may be a good physician
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.260]   prescribed substitution for people
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.020]   that can benefit from BPC-157.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.860]   - And a good starting dose,
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.460]   so to make it really clear for people and helpful,
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.740]   250 micrograms to 500 micrograms.
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.500]   We're using 500 micrograms injected daily.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.460]   Again, we like Monday through Friday, take the weekends off.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.300]   That's a good dosing schedule.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.860]   We'll see how that goes.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.180]   We probably can use larger dosages, that's conservative,
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.980]   but that's a good starting point for people.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.060]   - And thus far, you haven't mentioned any side effects
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.420]   of BPC-157 or pentadeca arginate.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.860]   That's kind of remarkable.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.340]   - It's been tremendous.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.020]   Yeah, and we were using BPC intravenously as well.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.420]   Patients would come in and, oh, tweak my knee,
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.380]   tore my ACL, tore my meniscus, whatever.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.460]   You can give them BPC essentially
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.780]   as a bolus intravenously.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.100]   My goodness, that made a difference.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.020]   Now, using something intravenously
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.820]   from the pharmacokinetic standpoint,
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.220]   it's not going to last in the system very much.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.420]   It's more of a spark,
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.580]   whereas if you use an agent subcutaneously,
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.900]   you're going to get more of a long-lasting,
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.260]   again, not terribly long-lasting with peptides,
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.840]   but longer than using something intravenously.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.020]   Kind of the sweet spot was certainly using both.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.460]   You could use something as a spark
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.780]   to initiate that anti-inflammatory cascade,
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.860]   then follow up with a subcutaneous dose, yeah.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.980]   - And even though earlier we were talking a little bit
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.980]   about some hormone replacement therapies,
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.540]   before that, off-microphone,
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.100]   you mentioned that you prefer peptides
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.180]   to direct hormone manipulations in most cases.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.300]   So I think while peptides can be hormones,
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.900]   there are things like oxytocin
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.220]   is sometimes called a peptide hormone.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.660]   In general, when people think about hormone therapies,
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.260]   they're thinking testosterone, estrogen, pregnalone,
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.540]   you know, thyroid, et cetera.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.620]   It sounds to me like much of your practice
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.620]   is built up around the notion
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.220]   that there are things that one can use,
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.140]   peptides to kind of push and pull on these various systems
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.820]   without getting into them directly.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.740]   My understanding is the advantage of that
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.060]   is you don't get the negative feedback.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.260]   You don't get in the shutting down of natural production.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.460]   - Yeah, you know, and testosterone is a great example
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.020]   because like we were saying,
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.640]   I don't ever want to manipulate hormones.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.500]   You know, growth hormone's another example.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.140]   I don't ever want to manipulate that,
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.540]   meaning, you know, providing it to people
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.260]   more than they would get in nature.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.080]   This is why I actually don't, a little bit off topic,
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.260]   like when people use testosterone pellets
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.860]   or any sort of pellet therapy
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.100]   because you're exposing people
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.580]   to a concentration of hormones
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.860]   we would never ever see in nature.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.660]   I would prefer people inject it
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.020]   where you're gonna get some variation in dose
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.940]   on a day-to-day basis, which we're humans,
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.900]   so we do get some day-to-day variation
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.040]   or topically or under the tongue or something.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.880]   Peptides, same thing.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.960]   I don't want to manipulate the hormones, right?
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.460]   I want to just stick within kind of the highways
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.140]   or the lanes, swim lanes for how they should operate
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.900]   and then take advantage of that.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.100]   And that's been a safe way to do it,
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.060]   as opposed to, and I've seen it,
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.380]   you know, talking about another peptide,
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.020]   which is ipramerolin, a growth hormone-releasing peptide.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.860]   Ipramerolin, you inject under the skin,
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.060]   travels up to the pituitary, the posterior pituitary
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.020]   in the brain, which is responsible
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.260]   for putting out growth hormone.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.620]   That growth hormone then leaves the pituitary,
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.780]   enters the bloodstream, travels to the liver,
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.340]   where we make insulin-like growth factor one,
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.020]   which then enters the circulation.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:39.620]   It's very anabolic, meaning growth, healing, mending.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.820]   You know, as we get older, we make less growth hormone.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.220]   As we get older, we wear down, obviously.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.240]   We get, you know, degenerative conditions.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.580]   Part of that, I don't know what part,
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.900]   if for everyone it's a little bit different,
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.540]   is because of our hormonal decline.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.900]   And so when you can give something like ipramerolin,
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.180]   and we can talk about others,
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.300]   you're actually helping not only push out
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.940]   a little bit of growth hormone for people,
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.900]   but you're directing when you push it out, right?
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.160]   We think, that's why it's important for people
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.740]   to be asleep by 10 p.m., between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.,
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.620]   'cause we think that's the largest pulse of growth hormone
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.000]   during the 24-hour period.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.840]   - Is that right?
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.900]   So I've long wondered whether or not
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:18.260]   the tale I was told when I was growing up,
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.860]   which is that every hour before midnight
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.820]   is worth two hours of sleep, post-midnight.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.100]   - That may be true. - That feels true to me.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.180]   Then again, feels true is often misleading,
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.420]   but feels true to me, but it makes perfect sense
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   if the largest pulse in growth hormone
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.460]   is occurring in the couple of hours before midnight.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.780]   - Yeah, I mean, that's how I learned it.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.100]   I agree with you, it feels true to me as well.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:43.540]   But taking advantage then of injecting something
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.140]   like ipramerolin at bedtime,
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.300]   then you're gonna, within a few minutes,
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.540]   and with ipramerolin, it's interesting,
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.500]   'cause people will get a little flushing,
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.260]   tingling at times, and what I've seen,
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.260]   with the point I'm making, is there are some physicians
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.020]   and some pharmacies which, the dosage of ipramerolin
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.460]   in most of these growth hormone-releasing peptides
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.700]   should be 100 micrograms.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.180]   That's the max dose to bind the receptor.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:11.860]   And what I've seen is, with ipramerolin, rare,
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:15.860]   but some people do get anaphylaxis, and it's happened.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.020]   And I think that happens when people are pushing it
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.260]   and giving more than they should, and I've heard of that,
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.900]   and they're giving 200, 300, 400 micrograms at a time,
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.340]   which is a big dose.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.180]   Now, what they're getting is the client, the patient,
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.300]   is like, "Oh my gosh, I feel this amazing flushing.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.380]   "It must be working."
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.640]   But then you could spiral into, "Oh my goodness,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.820]   "I don't feel so good,"
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.220]   and your circulation system collapsing.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.420]   - Yeah, using side effects as a indicator
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.660]   of whether or not something's working
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.500]   just seems like a terrible idea, but--
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.340]   - But it's very common, yeah.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.460]   - I tend to be very conservative about these things.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.300]   And by the way, I've tried various peptides
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.580]   for short periods of time,
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.400]   'cause I like to experiment very safely.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.980]   And some things, like sermorelin,
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.500]   and we'll talk about other growth hormones, secretogogs,
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.100]   for me, for whatever reason, gave me great sleep,
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.960]   but only in the first part of the night.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.620]   It nuked my rapid eye movement sleep
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.700]   in the second half of the night.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.580]   It spiked my prostate-specific antigen.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.780]   It was a very consistent effect.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.500]   I came off it and it went back down,
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.740]   and it went back on, it went back up.
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.860]   And so I just found I couldn't take it.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.380]   And it didn't take me very long to figure that out,
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.860]   but I know that there are some people who love sermorelin
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.440]   and don't see any of the same issues.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.180]   So it seems like it can be very individual.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.020]   - I agree with that.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.860]   I agree with that.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.540]   And that's why I think it's, again,
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.700]   helpful to work with a physician who has experience,
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.620]   who can kind of, you know,
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.460]   I think of these peptides as having flavors,
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.740]   particularly the growth hormone-releasing peptides.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.000]   Ipromerolin, very clean.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.380]   You know, as long as you stay within 100 micrograms or less,
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.580]   people are gonna lean out a little bit,
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.900]   sleep a little bit better.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.660]   There's no real side effects.
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.020]   - They take it pre-sleep.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   - Pre-sleep at bedtime.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.660]   - Without carbohydrates ingested
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.060]   in the previous two hours, correct?
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.660]   - Yeah, or 45 minutes, technically.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.840]   Yeah, but that's right.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.520]   And then they're saying like growth hormone-releasing
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.740]   peptide six, GHRP6, which is also going to bind.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.020]   So I think of Ipromerolin being the most specific
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.740]   for the growth hormone receptor, but the weakest.
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:06.900]   So when you inject it,
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.940]   you will get growth hormone to come out
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.980]   and only growth hormone,
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.180]   but it's not gonna be a big burst of growth hormone.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.820]   You inject GHRP6, now you may bind some prolactin.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.260]   Now you may bind some ACTH,
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.280]   which is gonna have your adrenals put out cortisol.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.420]   Now you're gonna get a hunger response, right?
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.740]   - And maybe even have trouble sleeping.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.680]   - You may have trouble sleeping,
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.860]   but where that's beneficial for us,
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.860]   if you're looking to put on mass or get strong,
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.260]   GHRP6 is your go-to, right?
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.220]   Because you will increase your appetite.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.120]   And if you're smart, you'll eat a lot more protein.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.040]   You know, and the building of muscle
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.800]   is not necessarily complicated, right?
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.460]   It's resistance training, sufficient protein,
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.940]   which is where I think most people fall off.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.580]   And then having some anabolic kind of hormone
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.340]   in the background, like growth hormone,
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.060]   or testosterone or both helps that process.
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.580]   That's where GHRP6 can shine.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.980]   I mean, within weeks, people will get big and strong,
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.400]   increase their bench press, whatever.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.900]   Stuff flat out works, but you gotta know how to use it
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.420]   and understand the flavors.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.260]   The point I'm making is,
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.540]   these different peptides have different flavors.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.940]   And to your point, there's individual responses.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.460]   That can be a good thing.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.260]   - I think for most of our audience,
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.220]   the interest in growth hormone secretogogs
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.460]   probably relates to the better sleep
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.940]   and the overall feelings of vitality.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.220]   And probably most people are seeking
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.620]   to not spike their appetite or put on muscle, really.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.140]   These days, we're hearing more and more from people,
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.180]   both men and women, who want to be strong without being big.
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.520]   And they prefer to be lean as opposed to not lean,
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.340]   which I think is a great goal.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.420]   Frankly, that's my goal at this stage of life.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.260]   I just turned 49 yesterday and I-
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.100]   - Happy birthday.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:39.940]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:40.760]   Thank you.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.260]   Yeah, thanks for coming out to the birthday mini bash
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.080]   the other day.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:45.920]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.520]   You know, I, yeah, I want to be strong and capable.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.640]   I also want to be able to run
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.940]   and have cardiovascular fitness,
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.800]   but I don't want to be large.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.120]   I don't want to take up a lot of space.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.160]   I'm not interested in taking up a lot of space.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.560]   And I think most people fall into that category.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.400]   - I agree.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.240]   - So if GHRP6 can spike appetite,
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.280]   which for a subset of people might be useful,
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.240]   but probably most people will want to avoid it.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.600]   Ipamorellin, I've always been calling it Ipamorellin,
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.240]   but Ipamorellin at a hundred micrograms dosage
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.600]   or less per night sounds like it's an interesting tool.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.080]   What are some of the other growth hormone secretogogs?
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.280]   And I should just brief,
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.240]   I'll take the liberty of defining it.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.880]   These are peptides that stimulate the release
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.840]   of your own endogenous growth hormone.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.360]   This is not taking growth hormone.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.200]   - Right.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.020]   Two other main ones that we use.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.540]   One would be tesamorellin,
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.680]   which is similar to semirellin
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.120]   and that it also is going to work
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.400]   on the growth hormone releasing hormone aspect
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   a little bit higher up in the chain
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.640]   of how these hormones are released.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.420]   So both semirellin and tesamorellin,
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.460]   you don't necessarily need to add anything else to it.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.160]   Classically with Ipamorellin, Hexarellin, GHRP6,
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.520]   we would add this other compound, CJC1295,
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.760]   which is going to work on the GHRH,
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.280]   which allows the peptide and then the growth hormone
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.800]   to stay in your system a little bit longer.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.360]   - The growth hormone releasing hormone.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.200]   - Correct.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.760]   - Yeah, but we can almost set aside CJC now
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.960]   because CJC1295, the FDA just came in
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.840]   and let's just say one acronym took out another.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.680]   - There you go.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.960]   - The FDA took out CJC.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.360]   - That's right, and BPC.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.120]   - Yeah, and BPC.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.480]   People are probably getting a little dizzy
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.320]   with these acronyms,
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.480]   but I think we're doing a good job of guiding people along.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:34.440]   So semirellin and tesamorellin are similar enough.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.880]   - Similar in that regard.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.720]   Tesamorellin, again, talking about flavors,
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.400]   tesamorellin works on visceral fat reduction,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.640]   so fat around the organs.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.840]   And it's been FDA approved for that purpose.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.760]   - Yeah, with HIV patients having this lipodystrophy,
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.520]   which is abnormal accumulation of fat
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.760]   in particular visceral fat around organs.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.920]   So tesamorellin works well for that.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.760]   My observation from using it for lots and lots of people,
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.480]   seems to work better in females than males.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   - Or does it lead to this feeling
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.440]   of enhanced sleep as well?
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.120]   - Yeah, so I think any of the growth hormone
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:05.960]   releasing peptides,
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.280]   anytime you're going to make growth hormone
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.600]   more active in your world,
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.920]   that's how I think about it,
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.800]   better sleep, better skin tone, texture, right?
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.720]   You're more resilient.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.920]   I think growth hormone is a resiliency hormone, durability.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.040]   People find that, oh, I do a hard workout,
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.200]   but it takes me days to recover.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.920]   I sprain my ankle, it takes me a week to recover.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.680]   I cut my skin, it takes me forever to heal.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.400]   They've got a durability issue.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.960]   And that's how I think about where growth hormone can shine.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.920]   Not that you got to go all the way to growth hormone,
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.160]   but these peptides can be a really nice push.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.800]   - And this is taken before sleep,
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.920]   no food within 45 minutes of the injection.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.760]   - And then the kind of the magic in what we do
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.820]   is when we first started about eight years ago,
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.840]   we'd use one peptide at a time.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.520]   And then what we learned is let's combine these peptides,
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   let's stack peptides.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.360]   And that's how we do it.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.720]   - At lower dosages?
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.660]   - Sometimes lower dosages.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.000]   But for example, we had a great combination,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.760]   BPC, ipramerone, and tesomerone all together,
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.080]   taken at bedtime.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.880]   And you're going to get subcutaneous fat reduction
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.860]   from the ipramerone,
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.040]   visceral fat reduction from the tesomerone,
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.960]   upregulation of the growth hormone receptor from the BPC.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.200]   It was a wonderful peptide.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.360]   We kind of labeled it as a fat loss peptide,
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.760]   but people would put on lean muscle mass,
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.080]   they'd sleep better, their skin would be better,
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.440]   they'd be more durable,
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.000]   their thought process would be better.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.840]   Awesome stuff.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.720]   And that's where I think,
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.000]   that's where we enjoy it is stacking these peptides together.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.800]   So it's not, again, just one peptide at a time,
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.640]   but able to do it.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.960]   And that's why, again, working with a compounding pharmacy,
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.980]   we can put these together.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.160]   So you're only doing one shot a day.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.920]   You may be doing three to seven peptides,
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.580]   but it's still one shot.
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.420]   - Got it.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:42.400]   And if one is combining a tesomerone or seromerone,
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.280]   ipramerone and, well, not BPC anymore,
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.680]   but pentadeca arginate instead,
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.000]   'cause you can't get BPC-157 compounded,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.640]   is that done every night, five days a week,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.880]   three days a week?
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.200]   What's the rationale of this five days on, two days off?
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.640]   - Five days on, two days off,
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.120]   I came up with because of how we would dose growth hormone.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.880]   So the traditional growth hormone dosing cycle
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.600]   would be five days on, two days off, taken at bedtime.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.440]   Yeah, and that's where it came up.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.160]   And then I personally, with patients and myself,
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.640]   I like to take breaks.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.080]   So even with supplements,
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.200]   I won't take them on the weekends, right?
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.080]   Because I think, again, anything you expose yourself to
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.560]   on a regular basis is gonna decrease the potency.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.280]   We see that with exercise, we see that with food.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.360]   If you're eating the same food every day,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.640]   it seems to become less valuable for you, right?
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.720]   Like, change it up.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.440]   Like, we have to throw on the crazy switch
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.520]   every now and then, but change it up.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.760]   And so then you're gonna make it more potent for you.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.000]   I do the same thing with supplements.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.640]   So that just resonates with me, with people,
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.600]   to take a break from stuff.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.960]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.640]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.280]   I recently became a Function member
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.560]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.600]   to lab testing.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.520]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.480]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.120]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.000]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.760]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.040]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.440]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.200]   Function not only provides testing
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.640]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.320]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.160]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.720]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.560]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.720]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.000]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.800]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.680]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.160]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.840]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.160]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.920]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.280]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.200]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.240]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.000]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.560]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.980]   is so important for health.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.760]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.680]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.160]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.080]   both at the level of ease of use,
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.600]   that is getting the tests done,
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.520]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.920]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.160]   And I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.480]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.760]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.360]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.960]   but they're offering early access
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.200]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.480]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.640]   to get early access to Function.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.940]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.620]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.680]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.800]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.360]   of quality sleep each night.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.480]   That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.080]   physical health, and performance.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.320]   And one of the best ways to ensure
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.640]   that you get a great night's sleep
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.140]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.900]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.680]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.200]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.700]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.640]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.240]   about one to three degrees.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.800]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.020]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.600]   by allowing you to control the temperature
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.200]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.860]   middle, and end of the night.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.520]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.760]   for nearly four years now,
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.620]   and it has completely transformed
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.200]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.320]   Eight Sleep has now launched their newest generation
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.960]   of the Pod Cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.120]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.360]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.800]   and even has snoring detection
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.080]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.480]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.620]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.000]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.560]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.160]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.680]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.080]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.200]   Before we started recording,
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.000]   you mentioned that you're actually not a huge fan
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.840]   of taking massive amounts of supplements,
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.680]   that you are a big fan of taking CoQ10,
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.920]   coenzyme Q10, 200 milligrams per day in the morning.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.000]   I also take CoQ10.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.480]   I think I started taking it
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.040]   for "general mitochondrial health."
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.760]   I don't know that I thought very carefully
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.400]   about exactly what I was trying to accomplish with it,
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.780]   but what is the rationale of taking CoQ10?
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.760]   - So if I can break it down, try to keep it simple,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.600]   if people are familiar with the mitochondria,
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.680]   it's the battery of the cell,
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.300]   these little organelles inside each cell,
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.120]   and they're responsible for doing many things,
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.300]   but primarily making ATP, chemical energy.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.200]   And so how do we make energy?
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.580]   Well, there's three main ways the body uses it, right,
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.420]   or makes it.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.440]   First is glycolysis.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.480]   We take glucose, which is a six-carbon molecule.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.620]   We break it in half to make two pyruvates, right?
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:52.860]   When we do that, we make a little bit of ATP.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.280]   That pyruvate then is converted
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.060]   to something called acetyl-CoA.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.940]   We run that through the Krebs cycle,
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.360]   where we're also making ATP,
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.640]   but then we're making these intermediate products.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.880]   One of those intermediate products,
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.080]   and the main one is something called NADH.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.440]   That NADH is then shuttled to the mitochondrial membrane.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.000]   This is the magic where we make the most ATP,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.120]   and there's five different hubs, or we call cytochromes,
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.320]   right, and this is how I think about it,
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.520]   'cause I just like to simplify.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.040]   Cytochrome 1 is where we use NAD,
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.500]   and what the different hubs are doing
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.160]   is we're exchanging electrons for protons,
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.180]   and that's kind of an electrical process.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.000]   We're exchanging electrons for protons,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.720]   going down an assembly line to eventually turn this wheel,
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.600]   the ATPase wheel, to make ATP.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.440]   The way I understand it is the five different hubs,
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.640]   different nutrients hit them, so cytochrome 1 is NAD.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.880]   Cytochrome 2 is riboflavin, vitamin B2, and succinic acid.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.680]   Cytochrome 3 is CoQ10, vitamin K2.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.220]   Cytochrome 4 is methylene blue, which we can talk about,
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.200]   and then cytochrome 5
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.840]   are things like magnesium, vitamin A, and copper.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.600]   So if you're thinking about mitochondrial health,
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.760]   if you include any or better all of those,
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.400]   you're gonna maximize how your mitochondria can work
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.720]   and make energy.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.000]   It's the strongest way to do it,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.840]   and it's, again, not necessarily complicated.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.640]   So when I think of CoQ10, and again,
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.360]   we use a lot of NAD, which we can talk about,
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.680]   where I think most people,
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.880]   the traffic congestion happens on cytochrome 1, right,
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.040]   and so when we give people or up-regulate
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.760]   their NAD production, it's essentially we're allowing
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.120]   for more electron flow at cytochrome 1,
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.720]   which has a downstream effect on the other cytochromes,
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.560]   so the traffic jam opens up,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.160]   and now you can move electrons to exchange for protons
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.480]   and make way more ATP.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.840]   But that's not true for everyone,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.800]   and so some people, it could be at cytochrome 3
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.440]   with CoQ10, it could be at cytochrome 2.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.080]   A lot of people at cytochrome 4, which is, again,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.920]   cytochrome, we call it cytochrome C oxidase,
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.720]   which is where methylene blue binds,
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.360]   but that's just a simplistic view.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.400]   People, we run into traffic jams, right?
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.280]   These electron flow gets stuck.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.200]   We're just trying to open up the traffic jam.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.680]   - So 200 milligrams a day of coenzyme Q10
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.800]   can facilitate some of that flow.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.400]   - Cytochrome 3, for sure.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.080]   And CoQ10's been studied very safe,
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.520]   up to 2,400 milligrams a day, no harmful,
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.800]   yep, no harmful effects.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.920]   Sometimes I'll take more, like I was telling you earlier,
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.560]   it's been dramatic for me with migraine headaches
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.000]   and basically reducing them to zero.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.120]   - You know, as people are hearing this,
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.280]   they're probably thinking, okay, well, these are just,
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.240]   you know, this is what I call anecdote or whatever.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.360]   I, you know, I don't have to remind people
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.160]   that you're a board certified physician.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.360]   I think that what was still ringing in the back of my mind
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.600]   this entire conversation,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.800]   even though I'm paying very careful attention,
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.600]   is that most of the drugs that are prescribed
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.360]   in this country are off label.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.240]   I think that just like, I don't think I've ever heard
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.440]   that stated out loud.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.480]   - Yeah.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   - It's wild.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.240]   - So the idea that people would take something
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.600]   that wasn't shown in a clinical trial
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.240]   to be effective for purpose A,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.840]   that they would, but it gets approved for purpose A,
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.840]   but then can be prescribed by doctors
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.600]   for purpose B, C, D, or E.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.440]   - Right.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.960]   - I mean, you're not telling me this is commonplace.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.040]   You're telling me this is the majority
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.240]   of prescription drugs.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.480]   - But it makes sense if you think about it, right?
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.840]   So if you took an antibiotic, right?
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.520]   Like we can just, and antibiotics can be very specific
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.880]   what it gets approved for in terms of like working
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.240]   against a specific bacteria.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   But then through clinical use and just experience,
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.920]   you know, we learned that, oh, I can use doxycycline
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.840]   or a Z-Pak, azithromycin, or whatever it is
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.040]   for a variety of bacterial infections
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.320]   that extend well beyond just what it's approved for.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.280]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.240]   - And does that ever cycle back to the clinical trials
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.000]   or no, this just becomes physician understanding and lore?
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.320]   Like, hey, yeah, you know, I've got patients that,
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.200]   you know, they get on azithromycin
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.840]   and their acne clears up.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.040]   By the way, I'm not saying that, folks.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.880]   I'm not a physician, but for instance.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.040]   - Exactly what happened with semiglutidinozempic, right?
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.960]   Approved for helping glucose utilization
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.080]   or lowering, you know, blood glucose in patients
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.320]   with type two diabetes.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.880]   And they found through use only, people were losing weight.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.400]   And now it's become a blockbuster and it's,
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.960]   and we see it with, you know, things like, you know,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.000]   repurposing drugs for cancer, right?
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.080]   There's a lot of that going on, a lot of the repurposing.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.520]   So, you know, doxycycline is a very common one
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.320]   that's used in cancer therapies,
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.480]   I think by sophisticated oncologists.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.640]   I don't treat cancer, but by sophisticated oncologists
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.000]   who use things like doxycycline, Metformin,
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.520]   Mabendazole, which is an antiparasitic drug, right?
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.440]   To help with cancer.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.280]   So that's amazing.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.080]   - So interesting, it is amazing.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.960]   I think also, you know, I'm reminded that,
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.600]   you know, medicine, as beautiful a field as it is,
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.640]   I have tremendous respect for it, of course,
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.780]   is a field of fairly siloed training.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.040]   And I love the idea that now,
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.800]   thanks to public education efforts like this one
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.720]   that you're providing us,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.840]   that physicians learn from each other in a much broader way
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.400]   and can potentially hear about
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.460]   what drugs can be useful for this or that.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.320]   The other thing, and this is not editorial,
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.280]   this is a real observation.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.240]   Pharmaceutical companies are very interested
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.480]   in the other uses of already approved drugs.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.080]   The research and development process for a drug,
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.040]   the safety evaluation is incredibly expensive.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.440]   So they want nothing more than to take a drug
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.620]   that's already been approved for one purpose
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.560]   and to take that already safety approved drug
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.040]   and find other uses.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.920]   How are they not circling back to the off-label use
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.800]   and understanding of these compounds
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:35.440]   and then essentially marketing them
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.840]   for these other purposes?
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.040]   Or I guess with Ozempic, that's exactly what happened.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.120]   - That's what happened with Ozempic.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.720]   Again, I write prescriptions.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.000]   I think there's a time and place.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.760]   I think it's challenging for me, though, right?
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.160]   And I think for a lot of physicians,
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.800]   it's become challenging operating in a paradigm
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.200]   where we talk about chronic disease,
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.560]   which is essentially failing.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.440]   I mean, and we all know this statistically,
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.080]   we're not making huge dents in heart disease, cancer,
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.780]   autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.040]   We're not at all,
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.240]   but we're spending exorbitant amounts of money, right?
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   And this is something that I had to learn over time.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.320]   And I don't know how I got into it,
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.600]   but when I started my practice back in 2006,
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.000]   I started, it was a traditional family medicine practice,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.160]   but I started using these nutritional IVs.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.000]   And this is before hangover IVs,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.700]   this is before it was popular.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.320]   This is 20 years ago.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.920]   And what I learned was that these nutritional IVs
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.280]   help people feel better quickly.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.920]   And I developed this model for my patients,
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.360]   which I think is a better model,
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.840]   which is, I wanna help people feel better first,
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.760]   like we were talking about earlier in this podcast.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.280]   'Cause if I can get people to feel better,
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.760]   what we learned through COVID,
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.440]   and honestly, what I wanna say to you, Andrew,
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.960]   which is really true,
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.800]   your podcast and what you do has been so successful
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.160]   at a time during the pandemic
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.880]   when people lost so much trust in people like me, right?
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   People lost that trust of, what do I do?
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.160]   You know, this is a scary time.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.440]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.160]   And you guys come along,
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.040]   you in particular providing this very stable,
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.760]   vetted information that people can trust
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.320]   and have a starting point and be like,
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.240]   this is what I wanna do.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.520]   Because health, one of the gifts of COVID
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.000]   was it put our health on the forefront
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.040]   of most people's mind and life.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.860]   And so what you're doing is tremendous work.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.520]   And I can tell you personally- - Thank you.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.720]   - No, literally, like as a physician,
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.440]   I am just, it's such an honor to be here
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.580]   and to talk to you because every day,
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.280]   every day my patients come to me and said,
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.920]   I heard this on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.120]   What do you think of it?
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.400]   And I am not joking.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.560]   And I love that.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.480]   I think it is awesome because people,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.360]   one, taking their health seriously,
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.720]   but two, they have a stable resource that they can trust.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.680]   The problem with physicians,
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.000]   and I'll tie this back in is,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.960]   physicians are hard to trust, right?
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.760]   And it's this paternalistic model, which is,
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.440]   and that's how I was trained,
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.460]   which is, you're gonna do this
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.500]   'cause I'm gonna tell you to do it, right?
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.460]   And I remember being in medical school,
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.140]   which was in the '90s.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.560]   And I can't remember the exact specifics of the study,
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.380]   but they would go, they did a study
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.340]   where they collected the trash
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.220]   outside of physicians' offices,
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.540]   found that greater than 30% of prescriptions
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.520]   written that day were thrown away.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.320]   Greater than 30%, wow.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.740]   And I remember learning that,
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.060]   and I was like, what is going on?
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.100]   - By the patients. - Correct.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:35.760]   Like, you came to the doctor
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.240]   because you wanted a prescription, right?
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.960]   No, you came to the doctor 'cause you weren't feeling good.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.840]   You came to the doctor 'cause you wanted to be listened to.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.400]   You came to the doctor 'cause you wanted to be validated.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.120]   And most of the time, and this still happens to today,
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.600]   the vast majority of doctors
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.320]   will just write you a prescription,
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.920]   or they'll write you two prescriptions.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.080]   And that's not what most people want.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.160]   Sometimes it is, and I do it, and sometimes it is,
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.400]   but there are so many other tools that we can use.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.780]   And so, when I help people feel better first,
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.740]   why I've been successful,
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.300]   and I work with the peak people on this planet,
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.580]   whether they're athletes, the best athletes,
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.860]   celebrities, the royal family, you name it,
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:21.140]   I'm so privileged, it's because they trust me.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.700]   And that trust is really important,
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.260]   and I take that really seriously.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.100]   You know what I mean?
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.260]   And so, tying it back in is,
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.020]   we've lost a lot of that with the pandemic.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.300]   It's actually come to the forefront.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.800]   And so, that's why I wanna help people feel better first.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   You know, the traditional model of medicine is just,
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.160]   get a diagnosis, write a prescription.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.280]   If that prescription doesn't work,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.440]   write another prescription.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.200]   And so, yes, there's a time and place for that,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.520]   but there's also a time and place for just helping people.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:50.080]   It only works when people value themselves enough.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.320]   Like, I can tie this back to weight loss, right?
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.600]   Why do people have such trouble losing weight?
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.480]   I would argue that most people
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480]   don't value themselves enough
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.580]   to actually care enough
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:04.420]   to make the hard disciplinary choices in their life,
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.620]   to get away from emotionally eating.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.460]   You know what I mean?
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.060]   To do the right things that they actually,
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:09.980]   it's gonna be a struggle
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.460]   to get the right food for themselves,
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.700]   get away from processed foods,
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.180]   to be disciplined, to go to the gym on a regular basis.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.100]   They don't have the right people that they trust.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.500]   This is where you've been such a gift, tremendous gift.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.780]   - Well, thank you for the kind words.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:26.060]   I mean, the birth of the podcast
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.800]   did take place during the pandemic,
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.220]   and in large part, because I saw everybody
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.940]   getting very anxious, their circadian rhythms disrupted,
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:37.700]   and those were focuses of my laboratory.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.180]   And frankly, when I was a postdoc and graduate student,
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.960]   but especially as I got a little older in my years,
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.540]   I couldn't believe that, you know,
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.580]   I was reading these papers
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.560]   about how important morning sunlight is
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.400]   and all these things,
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.900]   but then my colleagues were all getting sick
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.820]   and dying around me
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.780]   or getting what we call the tenured look,
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.500]   where they show up, you know, start their job,
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.340]   and five years later,
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.300]   they look like they've aged 25 years.
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.660]   And I realized that I wanted to avoid that.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.940]   So I've always just enjoyed learning
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.980]   and sharing science and health tools.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.460]   And so thank you for the kind words.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.460]   I've certainly been kind of both astonished
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.940]   and positively amazed in the ways
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.920]   that the pandemic and the post-pandemic years,
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.820]   I like to think we're in the post-pandemic years.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.120]   I think we can safely say that now,
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.340]   how they've drawn people's attention
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.220]   to this idea that they need to take agency
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.420]   into their own healthcare,
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:35.420]   that no one, no pill, potion, injection, et cetera,
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.800]   can replace good behaviors.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.500]   Pills, potions, and injections
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.100]   can potentially augment those good behaviors
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.340]   and get people going down the right path,
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.820]   which is what we're talking about today,
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.720]   but that it's really a personal responsibility.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.420]   I mean, no one can give us a calmer mind.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.040]   No one can give us a healthier body.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.580]   No one can do that, right?
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.980]   You can, it's interesting that some
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.300]   of the wealthiest people in the world,
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.380]   the new thing isn't for people to boast
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.980]   about their yachts or their properties.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.900]   It's about their health.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.140]   It's about their vitality, their longevity,
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.380]   because that's the thing that I suppose
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.140]   in some sense money can start to buy,
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.900]   but it doesn't require a ton of funds
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.820]   to take great care of one's body and mind.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.140]   - It doesn't, and what I've learned,
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.740]   and I've had to learn this over time,
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.140]   and I think the wisdom is,
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.660]   and this is why it's even more challenging,
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.860]   'cause I think people go on social media
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.540]   and they listen to podcasts and they listen to influencers,
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.140]   and a lot of the messages is additive, right?
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.500]   If you're not doing a high-intensity workout every day
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.220]   and then doing sauna for X amount of time
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.260]   and then cold plunge and all this kind of dieting,
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.280]   you're not doing it well.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.280]   I know that stress of that is cumulative to people, right?
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.820]   And so what I've learned, and I have a really good friend,
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.740]   probably the most affluent, successful,
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.180]   but also the most generous and smartest person I know
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.100]   who lives on the big island,
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.660]   and he says to me, which is worth repeating here,
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:02.060]   "I look for every opportunity to surrender."
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.420]   And it is that surrender to people who you can trust
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.360]   to guide you, right?
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.660]   So you don't have to be the quarterback of everything,
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.420]   right, and that takes off the pressure.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.100]   And I think finding, it's not always about adding,
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.540]   it's actually creating space for us
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.180]   to just be in that flow, right?
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.020]   Like it's to be in like,
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.500]   and I know you've talked about this a lot,
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.660]   that kind of active rest place
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.700]   where it's not about being super focused
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.500]   and it's not about just going to sleep,
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.180]   but almost the best parts of our day
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.260]   is when we're in that flow state where things just click.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:34.460]   And to me, helping people with those types of times
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.740]   and figuring that out is the most valuable.
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.500]   And I don't think people talk about that enough,
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.980]   so I appreciate that you do a lot.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.820]   - Yeah, well, and I appreciate that you're bringing up
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.760]   this notion that just stacking more and more behaviors,
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.380]   like you got to crush a workout and do sauna,
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.180]   and that is not the message.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.800]   Sometimes we get teased
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.700]   and there's some good comedy takes on me
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:59.340]   that make me chuckle now and again about that,
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.580]   but that's not the approach.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.700]   These are tools that people can, it's a buffet.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.860]   And I think most everyone agrees that sleep is key.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.620]   Most everyone agrees that exercise is key,
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.500]   nutrition is key, great social connection is key.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.700]   When it comes to,
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.940]   because I want to make sure that we circle back to this,
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:20.260]   when it comes to the peptides,
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:23.500]   it seems that one of your approaches, if I may,
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.740]   is to kind of raise the tide
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:29.380]   so that the boat can get out to sea.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.220]   And we were talking
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.860]   about these growth hormone secretogogs.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:36.260]   We covered GHRP6,
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.740]   which is the one that stimulates appetite.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.200]   That's probably going to be a niche case condition
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.740]   that people would want to use that.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.100]   Ipromiralin, tesomeralin, seromeralin.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:47.540]   I get a lot of questions about, is it MK677?
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.740]   - What in the world is MK677?
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:50.720]   It sounds like a weapon.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.560]   - It does.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.380]   I think of it just like GHRP6.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.180]   However, it's absorbed well orally.
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:17:59.280]   So it's basically the same.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.580]   I see it working this very similarly.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.380]   - To GHRP6, so it stimulates appetite.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.220]   - It does.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.100]   - It can stimulate cortisol prolactin.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.660]   It sounds like a not good situation for most people.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.500]   - Not for most people.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.900]   Although, let me give you an example where it is.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.800]   I have a client, very successful guy,
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.080]   and he's been on testosterone.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.420]   He's doing all the things, right?
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.820]   He's in his early 60s.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.220]   He's working out well.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:26.060]   He eats well, super well, all these things.
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.820]   He can't put on muscle mass well, right?
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.540]   And actually, as people get older,
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.340]   that does become an issue for a lot of people
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.100]   is maintaining healthy muscle mass.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:38.980]   MK677, before it was taken off the compound list by the FDA,
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.180]   it's another one that was included.
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:44.020]   - Oh, another acronym take it out by the FDA acronym, okay.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.300]   - But you can take it orally,
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.100]   which again, removes the stigma
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.420]   or burden of having to do a shot,
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.340]   and you will increase your appetite.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:53.300]   And that actually is a very useful agent,
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.960]   metabolically for people as they get older.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.420]   And I know this, my kind of approach with this,
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.220]   and both personally and professionally,
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.180]   I try everything I can.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:06.260]   And I remember MK677, I took it bedtime.
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:10.080]   And it was an hour later, I was in a dead sleep,
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.860]   and I woke up and I had to go eat.
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.940]   - It sounds like puberty.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.700]   - It was, I was like, what is going on?
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.140]   'Cause I didn't totally understand.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:17.980]   I was like, what?
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.140]   Oh, I took that cap.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.060]   Oh my gosh, I should never have taken it right before bed.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.140]   And I had to go up and eat
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.960]   and destroyed my sleep that night.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.380]   But I learned and I'll always learn,
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.380]   and I'm grateful for it,
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.540]   but don't take that one at bedtime.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.300]   But it absolutely will stimulate your appetite.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.620]   - Which are the growth hormone secretogogs
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.780]   that your more typical patients
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.860]   who don't want to stimulate appetite,
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.180]   both male and female patients prefer?
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.460]   What are you compounding for them?
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.720]   - I test amarylline.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.100]   I don't see any appetite stimulation from that.
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.640]   Hexamarylline, we haven't talked about that.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.480]   I don't really see it.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.380]   - Tell us about hexamarylline.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.220]   - Yeah, hexamarylline.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.040]   - Hexamarylline.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:54.880]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.940]   Hexamarylline, I think of as more,
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.180]   again, if we talk about the flavor of these peptides,
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.200]   how I kind of look at it in my head,
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.580]   is more of the energy endurance
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.900]   growth hormone-releasing peptides.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.020]   I like it for people to use it in the morning.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.060]   They get a nice burst of energy.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.460]   They feel it's a clean energy.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.900]   It's not a caffeinated energy
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.540]   or jittery or anything like that.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.220]   And it's good for more endurance type.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.700]   You know, athletics are working out.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:20.500]   So people in that field of competition or whatever,
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.220]   I think hexamarylline is a great choice.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.500]   - Does not spike appetite.
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.540]   - I have not seen that.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.180]   - So this is taken first thing in the morning.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.460]   You get an additional growth hormone release.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.420]   - Yes, you do.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.460]   Yeah, you do in the early mornings when you're waking up.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.420]   - And you used to compound it with CJC-1295
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.820]   to get the other pathways involved that can help.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.180]   But now CJC has been taken out by the FDA.
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.020]   - Right, but hexamarylline still exists.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.020]   That can be compounded.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.340]   - What's the dosage on hexamarylline
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.300]   that you typically prescribe?
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.780]   - 100 micrograms.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.900]   It's the same as these other,
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.220]   like Ipramerone GHRP-6, 100 micrograms.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.140]   The two that are different would be Tessamerone.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.020]   Ideal dose is two milligrams per dose,
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.100]   which is 2,000 micrograms, so quite different.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.860]   And then Semmeron has actually a very broad dosing range,
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.540]   anywhere from 200 micrograms.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.820]   I've used it up to 3,000 micrograms,
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.840]   depending on, you know, your goals.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   - We were talking about coenzyme Q10 and the Krebs cycle,
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:20.460]   and I forgot to close the hatch on supplements more broadly.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.300]   Again, doesn't sound like you're a big fan
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.180]   of taking lots of pills and capsules.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.020]   I think some people will take that as a relief.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.740]   I think a lot of people get tired of taking a lot of pills.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.640]   Some people don't like to do that.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.700]   What are some of the other things that you do take
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.940]   besides coenzyme Q10?
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.120]   Earlier, we were talking about methylated vitamins
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.440]   of different kinds. - Methylated B vitamins.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.400]   - Yeah, this is becoming increasingly popular.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.280]   We're starting to hear more about methylation
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.160]   and methylated compounds.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.680]   Could you educate us on methylated B vitamins?
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.360]   - Yeah, and I think people are familiar with it.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.800]   You know, some people were talking on podcasts
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.040]   about the MTHFR SNP.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.040]   - We've not talked about that on this podcast,
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.280]   so it'd be nice to- - Sure, so a SNP
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.600]   is a single nucleotide polymorphism,
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.980]   meaning that genetically things don't flow as easily.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.060]   Again, that's an oversimplification.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:12.520]   And you know, you could be homozygous for that,
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.900]   meaning you have both genes making you,
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.580]   you know, influencing you more.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:20.260]   You could be heterozygous, meaning it's just one gene.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.300]   - One copy from one parent, or a homozygous copy
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:24.140]   from each parent.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.600]   - You say it way better than I do.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:29.260]   And so what that means is, and where we see that reflected,
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:33.420]   homocysteine is a marker we use, a lab marker we use.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:35.240]   It's an emerging marker for looking
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.580]   at one's cardiovascular risk profile.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.840]   And so if one's got an elevated homocysteine,
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.580]   and elevated by some labs is gonna be greater than seven,
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.700]   by most labs greater than nine,
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.300]   means you're at an increased risk.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:48.700]   And what that is, I don't remember,
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.540]   but you're at an increased risk
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.760]   of having a cardiovascular event,
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.660]   which would mean a heart attack or stroke.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.920]   And so we wanna lower that number.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.780]   And the best way to lower that number
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.600]   is taking ample methylated B vitamins.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.560]   Methylated means you're adding a methyl group.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.560]   So methyl B12, methylfolate, trimethylglycine, methionine.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.740]   These are all methylation donors,
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.060]   which just metabolically
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.780]   and through your detoxification pathways in your liver,
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:19.000]   is going to help you lower that homocysteine.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.300]   I'm sure it's more complicated than that,
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.060]   but that's, most people, if you're gonna take a B vitamin,
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:27.660]   take a methylated B vitamin, because then you overcome,
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:30.640]   again, we've done a lot of MTHFR testing.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.720]   I don't think it's as profound
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.860]   as some people make it out to be,
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.300]   like it's gonna change their life.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.500]   I've never seen that.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.500]   Can it help you?
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.540]   Sure, but you're gonna overcome it
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.780]   by taking sufficient methylated B vitamins anyway.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.580]   - And again, those methylated B vitamins are methylated B12.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:49.020]   - B12, folate, there's a methylated B6.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.940]   There's, and then trimethylglycine, TMG,
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.100]   is a good compound.
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.980]   Methionine is a good methyl donor, it's an amino acid.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.740]   - Are these taken in the morning or in the afternoon?
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:23:59.580]   - I like taking them in the morning,
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.300]   although I think for people to play around with,
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.380]   'cause I've certainly seen it,
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:06.420]   people get that 3 p.m. kind of slumber,
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:08.980]   as opposed to reaching for the coffee or the donut,
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.260]   take some more methylated B vitamins and see what happens.
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.300]   - Or just the coffee.
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.460]   - No, sorry, you're not supposed to drink caffeine
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.420]   too late in the day.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.940]   Lately, what I've, I don't know,
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.560]   this is wrong to bring up on this podcast,
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.760]   but I can't help myself.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.560]   I love your remate in the morning and afternoon.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.140]   Coffee in the morning now makes me feel nauseous.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.620]   I don't know if I'm pregnant or something,
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:30.300]   but it makes me feel nauseous.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.740]   But I love the taste of coffee in the afternoon.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.020]   This is like a midlife thing.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.260]   I don't know what it is.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.620]   So now in the afternoon, like around one or 2 p.m.,
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.180]   even just the smallest amount of coffee,
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.140]   it's like the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:45.020]   - Yeah, I love coffee.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.720]   - It can mess with your sleep too late in the day,
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.060]   but that's a perfect segue to talk about sleep.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.660]   Because one thing that I know you've done a lot of work on
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:58.340]   and with are these peptides that can improve sleep,
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.980]   not just by virtue of enhancing growth hormone release,
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.860]   but I'll just be very direct.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:08.020]   I, for the last, gosh, like four to six months,
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.220]   I've had the opportunity to try pinellan,
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:17.940]   and injectable pinellan combined with glycine.
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:22.100]   Goodness gracious, in the positive sense
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.060]   of the goodness gracious, you're from the South.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:26.100]   So I don't know where people have the,
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.620]   never before have I found something that can improve
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:33.460]   the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that I get,
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.380]   besides rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.380]   You know, sleep deprivation,
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:37.940]   the next night you'll get a compensatory effect.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.380]   That's not the way to increase your REM sleep, folks.
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:41.540]   You know, there are a lot of things
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:44.340]   like high-intensity exercise
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.460]   that improve my slow-wave deep sleep.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.900]   Cold plunge early in the day improves slow-wave deep sleep.
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.540]   There have been a few other things.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.580]   But with pinellan, and by the way,
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:55.740]   I'm not doing this every night.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.180]   I do this occasionally, I ran a little experiment,
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.040]   and I track my sleep using the sleep tracker
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.140]   that's in Eight Sleep.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:04.820]   And it's doubling the amount of rapid eye movement sleep
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.820]   that I'm getting, doubling.
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.340]   Which is, so like from an hour to two hours,
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.820]   or from an hour and 30, it's like nearly three hours.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.420]   Even, I posted a picture of a sleep score
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:17.500]   with some rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.060]   It's not something I typically do.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.060]   But even the most competitive of biohackers,
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.420]   Brian Johnson, was like, "Oh, nice sleep score."
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.300]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.460]   - Now he touts a sleep score
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:32.620]   that's perfect every night for every night.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.420]   But, and I'm kind of poking at Brian,
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.620]   'cause we like to poke back and forth.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.220]   We're friendly with one another.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:43.260]   So the point being that pinellan is a remarkable way
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.220]   to increase rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.440]   I have very little knowledge about it,
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.820]   except that my understanding is that it might stimulate
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.340]   some regeneration or stimulation
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.900]   of the pinellocytes of the pineal.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.180]   - That's exactly it.
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.020]   You've nailed it.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.540]   Yeah, I remember when you messaged me after starting it,
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.260]   and you were like, "This is amazing."
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.100]   - It's amazing.
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.340]   - Yeah, you were saying amazing.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.580]   - I hope the FDA doesn't nuke it
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.420]   as a consequence of this conversation.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:08.100]   - It's still available, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:08.940]   I hope so too.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.460]   No, but I mean, your response is what we see
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.660]   with our other patients, who are loving.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.140]   And I think that combination with glycine,
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.500]   I'm a big fan of glycine,
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.380]   and injecting it seems to work really well.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.380]   But back to your question about pinellon.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:23.640]   Yeah, I mean, it's a bit one of the smallest peptides,
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.860]   but I think it's one of the most profound.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.740]   We used to combine it with epitalin,
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:29.860]   the Russian peptide that was used for circadian rhythm.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.660]   - And for my understanding, epitalin also,
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.860]   it's involved in DNA repair,
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:37.300]   and has been explored in animal studies
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:41.060]   for trying to offset vision loss
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.300]   and some retinal degenerative conditions.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.700]   - Yeah, again, put on the do not compound list
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.460]   with all the others, so that's gone.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.540]   But pinellon stays and remains,
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.180]   and yeah, your response to it,
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:56.900]   and experience with it, has been very commonplace
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.940]   for working with patients and seeing that.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:03.020]   I think there's a sort of circadian rhythm aspect
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.900]   with it as well, and helping with melatonin production.
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.620]   Obviously, that comes from the pineal gland.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.960]   I, this is just, I'm postulating,
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.100]   I think there's more to the pineal gland than we understand.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.500]   - Oh yeah, yeah, it makes things other than melatonin,
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.340]   that's for sure.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.740]   - Yeah, and I think it's kind of elusive,
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.880]   but I think there's something to it.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.580]   And I say that, having used a lot of pinellon
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:22.900]   with people over the years,
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:26.640]   and having very similar responses, which is awesome.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   Like everyone knows, like you said,
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.940]   when you sleep better, your entire day is better.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.920]   When you sleep better, your life is better,
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.760]   like exponentially better.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.780]   - I think of the millions of people
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.200]   that suffer from lack of rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.120]   the lack of neuroplasticity
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.020]   that can be the consequence of that,
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:52.020]   the lack of healthy removal of emotional labels
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.420]   on previous day memories,
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.660]   that is the consequence of REM deprivation,
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:00.500]   the enormous impact on depression rates,
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.480]   the enormous impact on pretty much every mental health issue
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.300]   is made worse by lack of REM sleep.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.460]   So I say, or I raise this conversation about pinellon
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.060]   with a little bit of trepidation,
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.320]   because I do worry that on the one hand,
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.740]   people will see it as a miracle drug.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.980]   That's not what we're talking about.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:19.460]   It has this effect, but at the same time, I,
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:20.660]   okay, I'll just say that, you know,
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:23.060]   there's another drug that was released recently.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:26.140]   This is a FDA approved drug
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.720]   in the category of sleep drugs called the Doras.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.860]   So it works a little differently.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.100]   It doesn't push on the sleepiness system, so to speak.
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.820]   It suppresses the wakefulness system.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:39.500]   And the idea is that it's supposed to increase REM sleep.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.620]   It was by name Quivivic and things like that.
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:45.620]   I tried it, it was a total disaster for me.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.060]   I fell asleep, woke up three hours later,
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.460]   couldn't fall back asleep.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.900]   I tried it, it was lower dosage.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.060]   It's extremely expensive as well.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.940]   So I'm going to piss off whoever makes Quivivic.
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:55.780]   I forget who makes it.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:57.460]   It was a complete disaster for me.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.960]   Pinellin has been incredible.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.060]   And here's, what's really interesting about it to me
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.800]   is that it seems to improve my sleep on the nights
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:10.300]   when I don't take it, which makes total sense
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.540]   if it indeed is providing some regeneration
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:15.520]   of the pinellicites that make melatonin and other-
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.360]   - That makes sense to me.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.740]   - Yeah, so here we're talking about something
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:20.860]   that one could potentially pulse with now and again
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:23.260]   and get improvement in sleep every night.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:24.100]   - Yes.
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:24.920]   - Yeah, wild.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.220]   - Yeah, and it's, I mean, I think it's worth noting
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.220]   that you also take care of your health
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:31.260]   on many other aspects.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.540]   And that's probably why you are sensitive to it,
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.460]   but it worked really well for you, right?
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.220]   And some other people, it's going to take longer,
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:40.140]   you know, if they're having to work on their diet
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.140]   and having to work on their exercise
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.660]   and having to work on their thought patterns, right?
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.620]   We don't talk about that enough, having positive thoughts.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.920]   But yeah, it's been, it's so safe.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.400]   We've never, ever seen, I mean,
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.500]   I never, ever have seen a side effect
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.380]   or negative side effect from pinellon.
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.540]   It's, and your response has been uniform.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.460]   You know, people don't always get there as quickly,
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:02.620]   but people get there with their sleep.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.460]   - Love it.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.960]   And you compound it with glycine.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.800]   - Yeah.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.840]   - What's the rationale there?
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.560]   - I really like glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.680]   It's calming to the nervous system over the years.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.340]   I tend to start with that when people are having trouble
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.700]   settling down at night,
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:19.900]   not that it's going to sedate people,
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.820]   but just transitioning from, you know, being active,
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.140]   you know, 8 p.m., 9 p.m., wanting to settle down.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.500]   Glycine in pretty large dosages,
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.100]   at least most people think they're starting
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.800]   with 3,000 or 5,000 milligrams orally,
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.500]   kind of tones down the nervous system.
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.860]   People relax a little bit
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:38.460]   and then they tend to sleep better from it.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.660]   And then you can dial it up.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.020]   I mean, I've used very large dosages for it.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.820]   The other advantage of glycine
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:46.620]   is it works on phase two liver detoxification,
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:48.300]   which is amino acid conjugation.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.580]   So you're helping your liver work better.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.820]   And in a world where we're being exposed
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:54.340]   with all of these toxic things
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:56.500]   from glyphosate to heavy metals,
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.380]   we all need to do some sort of, you know,
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.860]   liver mitigation strategies.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.460]   Glycine's one of the best.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.360]   - Wow.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.200]   Interesting.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.960]   We haven't done an episode of this podcast yet
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.800]   on heavy metals,
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.660]   but I'm very interested in this
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:12.100]   'cause many people write to me
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:16.700]   asking about metal toxicity and about mold toxicity.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.500]   - Molds become super big.
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.220]   Yeah, big.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.780]   Yeah, I mean, it's very prevalent.
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.020]   And it seems the more we talk about it,
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.740]   I mean, we've seen it for years and years and years.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.560]   It makes sense, right?
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.420]   Like if you think about the amount of airplanes
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:28.900]   flying above us every day,
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:30.280]   pouring down heavy metals.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.540]   I mean, it's massive.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.900]   It's in the air, it's in the water, it's in the soil.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.020]   You talk about glyphosate or Roundup, same exact thing.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:40.580]   So many chemicals and it's challenging for us as humans.
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.820]   The way I break it down, not to get too far off topic,
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.920]   is we're water-soluble organisms
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.140]   living in a fat-soluble world.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.700]   It's the job of our liver,
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:50.660]   essentially, to take the fat-soluble stuff,
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:53.380]   make it water-soluble so we can excrete it, right?
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.260]   And that takes place in the liver in two phases.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:57.500]   Phase one, we're using the P450 enzyme.
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.020]   It's like taking the trash,
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.060]   putting the trash in the trash can,
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.380]   putting it out on the side of the road.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:03.180]   And you have phase two, amino acid conjugation.
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.860]   The trash truck comes and picks up the trash.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.540]   Very few things in nature
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.860]   induce phase two independent of phase one,
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:11.700]   meaning most of us have trash
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.460]   piled up on the side of our road.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.540]   Those things are the polyphenols, right?
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.420]   And so things like the blues, the reds, the pigments,
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.340]   that's why it's important to eat
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:21.740]   a wide variety of colors in your diet.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.260]   Matcha tea has a very strong inducing effect
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:26.740]   on phase two liver activity.
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:27.580]   - Is that right? - Yep.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.060]   - I need to develop a taste for matcha.
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:29.900]   - Yeah. - I feel like
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:30.860]   it's kind of grainy.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.540]   - It is and it's bitter,
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.100]   but bitter things tend to be, again,
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.380]   helping that phase two.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.700]   Glutathione helps phase two.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.860]   We do a lot of that intravenously.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:41.020]   And then glycine is a wonderful agent
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:43.540]   for inducing phase two independent of phase one.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:46.180]   And the trouble is I don't think people realize,
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.540]   you know, people are told well, you know,
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.540]   most pharmaceuticals induce a P450 enzyme.
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.340]   And a misconception is well,
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:55.140]   if I'm just inducing one, I'm good.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.380]   If you induce one, you induce them all.
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:58.620]   So if you take any pharmaceutical,
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.340]   you're inducing your entire P450 system.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.300]   You're speeding it up,
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.740]   meaning you're putting more trash out
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.940]   on the side of the road.
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:07.460]   And if you look at the amount of things
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:09.500]   we're being exposed to outside of pharmaceuticals,
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:10.740]   it's mounting.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.380]   - When you say on the side of the road,
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.780]   you mean in the liver.
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:14.620]   - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.100]   I'm just using that as a metaphor.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:16.940]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:19.220]   - You're not talking about excreting it in the,
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.100]   you're talking about building up of debris,
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.060]   cellular debris with it,
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:25.980]   or excuse me, metabolic debris within your body.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   - Right, the trash, again, very oversimplification.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:31.180]   You need to speed up phase two
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.940]   to get the trash trucks come to pick up the trash
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.900]   so that you can then take that compound
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.500]   and excrete it in your stool,
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500]   in your urine, your sweat, your breath.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.700]   Right, I mean, it's the only way it works.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:42.060]   It's not complicated per se,
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.620]   but I think there's a lot of misconceptions about it.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:47.180]   - So when people take a peptide
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:49.580]   that's injectable pineal and glycine,
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.740]   they're getting glycine obviously,
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:53.140]   but for, let's say somebody doesn't have access
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:55.180]   to you or to, for whatever reason,
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:59.460]   there's a barrier to getting ahold of those peptides.
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.180]   Can people take glycine orally?
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.020]   - They can.
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.020]   Yeah, glycine's absorbed well orally.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.580]   It has a really sweet taste.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.540]   It's actually the smallest amino acid.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.380]   Huge fan of it.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:09.700]   We've been using it a long time.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.260]   You can take big dosages of it.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.420]   - So true. - Very sick.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.980]   Again, my starting dose is usually
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:16.140]   three to five grams at bedtime.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:16.980]   - Wow.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:19.020]   - And then I tell, the way I do this,
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:21.580]   recommended is try that for a few nights in a row.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:23.300]   Not noticing a thing, double the dose.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.560]   Go to 10 grams, literally.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.820]   Most people at 10 grams of glycine will notice it.
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.860]   And again, it's not gonna necessarily make you drowsy.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.180]   You're not gonna be sedated,
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:32.740]   but your nervous system's gonna be toned down a little bit.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.380]   It's gonna help you fall asleep a little bit better.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.900]   And then while you sleep,
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:39.140]   where a lot of this detoxification process starts working,
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.420]   you're gonna be more efficient in how your liver works.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:43.540]   Everything ties together.
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:44.380]   - Right.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:48.060]   I'm still a big fan of things like magnesium three and eight,
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.260]   apigenin, which is a chamomile derivative.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.460]   And I'll try glycine.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:53.420]   I think a few years back,
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.140]   I was using a little bit of glycine,
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.800]   but it was more like 1,000 milligrams.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.260]   But now that it's in the injectable peptide,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.140]   the pineolin, I don't take it.
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.800]   Is there an oral form of pineolin that works?
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:11.560]   - There's these bioregulator peptides,
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.880]   which were developed by this Russian scientist,
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.620]   last name Corbinson, I think.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.820]   Done a lot of research, actually.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.220]   There's published research about it.
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.260]   I think pineolin's one of the ones
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:25.300]   that they say will survive the stomach acid
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:27.920]   and get through the gut and be absorbed.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.580]   So I think that's true.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.300]   We've always used it as injectable.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.460]   And I tend to like injectable things
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.660]   for the bioavailability.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.460]   So yeah, but to your point, I think people can.
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.300]   Those are going to be harder and harder to find, actually.
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.640]   It's probably easier to find an injectable pineolin
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.480]   than an oral one.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.300]   - Yeah, and as we're talking about this,
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:46.380]   I'm realizing, unfortunately,
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.580]   just the way the internet works,
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.960]   that people are going to start selling,
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.820]   likely as a consequence of this conversation,
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.060]   we'll start selling pineolin,
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:56.060]   but you need to know that you're actually getting pineolin.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.700]   I mean, it's very easy for somebody
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.460]   to just pop something up on Amazon and sell it.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.340]   And maybe they just throw some melatonin in there
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:04.620]   and call it pineolin.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:07.040]   There's a lot of BS stuff out there.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.420]   So this is why the compounding pharmacy component
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:12.880]   and working with a physician is so key.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.820]   - And researching, right?
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.820]   Making sure that what you're taking is legit.
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:19.140]   Lot of illegitimacy out there.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:21.160]   - Do you think the pharmaceutical companies
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.300]   are going to move into these other peptides?
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.940]   I mean, certainly epimoralin
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.980]   for the reduction in visceral body fat,
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:30.180]   that's an FDA approved drug.
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:33.280]   So is somerolin, FDA approved drug,
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:39.020]   the GLP-1 agonists, FDA approved drugs.
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.060]   So the FDA is unlikely to pull those,
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.220]   but they're a blockbuster, especially GLP-1.
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.460]   I mean, they're making not even a small fortune,
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.560]   but a large fortune.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.400]   - Big money.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.900]   The concerning part about the GLP-1s is, to me,
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.800]   is what we're starting to see.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.060]   They've been able to be compounded
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.940]   because there was a shortage.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.500]   And the way it works with compounding pharmacies
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.780]   because those are brand name drugs
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.180]   and they're not patented for the peptide, right?
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:07.780]   They're patented for the delivery system, which is the pen,
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.300]   which most people don't realize.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.320]   And they've been able to be compounded
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.920]   and then way more affordable because they're compounded.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.100]   And there is rumors that the pharmaceutical companies
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.060]   now have supply back.
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.240]   They'll come back and they will, you know,
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:26.140]   remove the ability to allow these peptides to be compounded,
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:28.860]   which means we'll have to stick to traditional dosages.
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.600]   And people will lose access
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.540]   because they're going to be way more expensive.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:35.300]   I mean, they are, if your insurance doesn't cover it,
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.900]   1,500 a month for most people, very expensive.
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:40.740]   - That's a lot.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.560]   - Yeah.
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.180]   - For a lot of people, that's rent and more.
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:46.020]   - So I'm hopeful that doesn't happen,
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.740]   but that's in the works.
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.580]   That's in the works.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.300]   And that would be a huge shame.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.980]   And again, I'm not a pessimist by any means.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.040]   I'm a perpetual optimist.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:58.320]   So we'll just make sure it stays this way.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.980]   But, you know, again, if it does happen,
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:02.320]   we'll get creative and go other routes as well.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.900]   - Earlier, you mentioned stem cell therapies.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.060]   Those are not FDA approved in this country.
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:08.900]   - They are actually.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:10.020]   You can use-
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.260]   - Sorry, my mistake.
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:15.940]   - So I think that using the term stem cell is a problem.
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:20.940]   If we use the term autologous cell, which would be PRP,
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.100]   it's basically the same thing.
[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:23.060]   - Platelet rich plasma.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:23.900]   - Right.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.720]   - They take your blood, they spin it down,
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.560]   they take the-
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.540]   - Right, and so the ruling is I understand it.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:31.500]   As long as you're taking a cell from you
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.260]   and you give it back within four hours,
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:38.100]   then that is allowed under the FDA guidelines.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:38.940]   - Interesting.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.380]   There was this clinic in Florida a few years ago
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.380]   was touting stem cell therapies for macular degeneration,
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.820]   injected some stem cells into these patients' eyes
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.660]   and they went blind really quickly
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.540]   and they were not blind prior to the injections.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.140]   That, to my understanding,
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:01.360]   caused a severe setback to the whole field.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.860]   I'm old enough to remember when gene therapy
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.660]   was set back by about 10 years
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:09.380]   because a patient received gene therapy,
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:13.040]   which is now pretty common for certain diseases,
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.300]   and the patient died.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.320]   It's unclear exactly why they died,
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:22.180]   but that delayed the field of gene therapy
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.580]   by at least a decade.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.780]   I mean, this country is very conservative
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:28.540]   when it comes to the approval of new therapeutics.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:29.540]   - Sure.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:31.740]   Yeah, no, and I think, like anything,
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.940]   there's gonna be people who get too aggressive.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:36.340]   I've heard of doctors injecting stem cells
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:39.700]   into people's discs and then they get discitis,
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.860]   an infection, and that can just spiral very quickly.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.660]   I think it's, you gotta be reasonable
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:48.100]   in what you're trying to accomplish.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.020]   I'm excited about stem cells and exosome therapy
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.460]   and PRP and PRF and using them as kind of biologics
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.540]   and because I think there's a lot to learn.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:59.060]   I think we only know very little
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.100]   from what we've seen from working with our patients.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.620]   It's been tremendous from a rejuvenation standpoint.
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.460]   I mean, we're, as long as, you know,
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.620]   I think it's taking from your own, you know,
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:10.660]   and then giving back your own within how the FDA outlines it,
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.460]   I think that's a great way to do it.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.820]   - Well, certainly you have the clinical data
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.060]   to back those statements.
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.940]   Thymosin alpha-1, what is this peptide?
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.300]   But maybe before we discuss it,
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.780]   did the FDA nuke thymosin alpha-1?
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.620]   - They sure did.
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.620]   - Whoa, okay, they're coming through with a howitzer
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.980]   and taking out all these peptides.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:34.020]   Okay, well then let's keep this relatively brief.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:38.740]   What was thymosin alpha-1 being used for previously?
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.300]   - Yeah, I think it was, from my observation,
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:44.420]   the best peptide for immune modulation.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.460]   So we would use it if you had an overactive immune system,
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:49.220]   like autoimmune disease by definition.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.580]   If someone has an autoimmune disease,
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:53.580]   their immune system is attacking their own self, right?
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.660]   That's classically lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.060]   things like that, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes,
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.060]   those are all, you know, autoimmune diseases.
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.380]   We could use thymosin alpha-1
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:04.140]   and we tone down the immune response.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:07.380]   We'd also use it a lot in post-COVID
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:09.700]   where you have an abnormal immune response
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.460]   or the immune system hasn't caught back up
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:14.260]   and you can kind of dial it up using thymosin alpha-1
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:15.100]   in a very safe way.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.500]   We use it a lot with long COVID
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:20.940]   and we were using 5,000 micrograms a day,
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.820]   sometimes intravenously, getting great results, very safe,
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.260]   had no issues with it,
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:28.860]   but unfortunately it's off the table.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:32.300]   - I hear a lot of complaints about brain fog
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:36.480]   with long COVID and brain fog generally.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.480]   Cerebral lysine is a very interesting compound.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.220]   My understanding is that cerebral lysine
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:47.700]   is available in Europe more broadly than it is in the U.S.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:48.820]   Is it still? - It's available here.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.200]   - Did the FDA, is it taken out?
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.040]   - No, it's still available.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.900]   - Okay, all right, cerebral lysine made the cut.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.740]   - Yeah, it made the cut.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:55.380]   - We'll see what happens after this podcast.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.460]   - That's right.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.700]   We've used a lot of cerebral lysine.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.420]   I actually have a clinic that's open in London.
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:01.780]   We actually did use it.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:04.180]   We've used it a lot more over there than over here.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:06.300]   - So you have a U.S. clinic and a U.K. clinic?
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:10.100]   - We have one based in London and one in Charleston, yeah.
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.080]   And I think, you know,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.860]   cerebral lysine has been used for decades
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:16.940]   in the setting of, you know, post-stroke,
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.540]   post-traumatic brain injury.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:21.660]   The trouble with it, again, I've observed with people,
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:23.780]   they get cerebral lysine, we're talking about IV,
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.260]   you can also use it sub-Q,
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:27.060]   is they will have a day or two
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:29.640]   where they feel really down and out.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.920]   Like it's, like their mood shifts to like this dark place.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.260]   - That's scary.
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.420]   - Yeah, and they come out of it.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:39.900]   But most people don't like that feeling.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.940]   And so we just, we stopped using it mostly.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.540]   Yeah, for that reason.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.160]   - My understanding is that cerebral lysine
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.260]   is a kind of a cocktail of brain-derived nootrophic factor,
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.180]   ciliary nootrophic factor, like some other things.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:54.500]   It's not one thing.
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:55.700]   - Yeah, and I think, right,
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:59.260]   I think collectively it increases BDNF levels, right?
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:00.900]   Like there was dihexa too,
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:02.220]   I don't know if you're familiar with dihexa,
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.420]   that's another one that was removed by the FDA.
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.820]   Supposedly the most potent way to increase, you know,
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.300]   brain-derived nootrophic factor,
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:11.560]   kind of the juice the neurons live in,
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.380]   again, oversimplification.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.940]   That's gone, but I think cerebral lysine did the same thing.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.440]   - Interesting.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.580]   So as long as we're talking about maintaining
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.660]   or boosting cognitive function,
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.460]   here's one I've never tried,
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:25.940]   but you and I have talked a little bit about.
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:29.280]   And it's still seen as kind of renegade,
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.260]   but it's becoming more commonplace.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.660]   And that's methylene blue.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.540]   And I always make the joke
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:39.140]   that I used to use methylene blue to clean my fish tanks.
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.140]   'Cause I'm a big fish tank aficionado.
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.260]   At least I was when I was a kid.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:46.120]   Right now I don't have a tank, but it's empty.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.120]   No pun intended.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:55.100]   What is methylene blue and what are people using it for?
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.020]   And does it turn your tongue blue?
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.640]   - It does, for sure.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.480]   - Not permanently.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.380]   - Not permanently.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:03.300]   It's actually the first pharmaceutical
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.260]   ever prescribed in this country in the late 1800s
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:06.100]   was methylene blue.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:06.920]   - Goodness, here.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.660]   So it sounds like really renegade, but it's-
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:09.660]   - It's not. - Got it.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:13.980]   - Yep, but it's gained favor in the last five years.
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:15.380]   That's certainly when we learned about it,
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.140]   particularly, I learned about it through this doctor
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.340]   who was telling me with COVID patients,
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:23.280]   he was getting immediate, like within a day
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.820]   of stopping of COVID symptoms from using methylene blue.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.260]   That's what like piqued my interest.
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.980]   Like, wow, that's incredible.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:32.540]   And then he went on to say that then COVID tests
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:35.140]   were turning negative within a matter of like two days,
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:35.980]   which was unheard of.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:37.260]   - I've seen that with something else,
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.780]   but I'll get back to that.
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.660]   And so that's when I was like, oh, this is,
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:43.300]   then it started to be talked about and learned about it.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.300]   So methylene blue, when we talk about the mitochondria
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.700]   using that mitochondrial membrane
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.540]   binds to cytochrome C oxidase.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.260]   And I think of it, traditionally it's used
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:52.060]   when people have carbon monoxide poisoning.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:52.880]   They'll still use it.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.720]   You go in the emergency room,
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.820]   you have carbon monoxide poisoning,
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.260]   it'll give you methylene blue.
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.540]   And it helps your red blood cells
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.660]   displace the carbon monoxide and put oxygen there.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:02.620]   And so it's an oxygenator.
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:03.700]   That's how I think of it.
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.860]   - Is it used as a performance enhancing drug
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.740]   in endurance sports?
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.860]   'Cause this sounds like the kind of thing
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:11.980]   that cyclists would really want to use.
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:13.740]   Check with your local governing body.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.820]   There's always a question I get.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:15.660]   People are like,
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:16.900]   or they hear something on a podcast and they go,
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.380]   can I take it or am I going to get disqualified?
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:22.340]   And I always say, I have no idea if you'll get disqualified.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.860]   - I don't believe it's on the water list.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:24.700]   - Okay.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:25.660]   - I don't believe we-
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.260]   - We'll just look for the people with the blue tongues.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.100]   - Yeah.
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:28.940]   - Yeah, easy test.
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:32.540]   - So methylene blue, very well absorbed, very well orally.
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:35.380]   You know, I think of it like NAD, the molecule NAD,
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:39.100]   because it works on those cytochromes.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.140]   Different than NAD though, because NAD is not,
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.140]   if you're taking NAD by itself,
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:44.340]   not absorbed orally well at all.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:45.700]   It's one of the trouble with it.
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:46.620]   Methylene blue is.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:49.100]   And actually you can take way bigger dosages
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.260]   orally than intravenously.
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:52.140]   We've given it intravenously a lot,
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.580]   but we're limited in using it intravenously
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:57.640]   just 'cause it'll start to cause some spasm of the vein.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.980]   The arm starts hurting if you're giving too much
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.460]   methylene blue, either too much or too quickly.
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:04.380]   And so we can give it orally.
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.420]   You can get a capsule of it.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.260]   That's how we are.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.220]   - What dosages?
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:10.660]   - So I think a good dose is no more than 10 milligrams.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:11.480]   - 10 milligrams.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.320]   - Yeah.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.540]   - Taken when?
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.380]   - In the morning.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:17.540]   It is, you know, it's a cognitive stimulant for sure.
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:19.940]   I mean, I've had more people over the last five years
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.620]   'cause we make methylene blue.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.100]   We combine it with some other agents,
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.860]   a little bit of caffeine, some B vitamins.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:26.980]   And people say, this is the best thing for, you know,
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:28.380]   my brain function, recall, memory.
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.820]   - Kind of quote, unquote, nootropic.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.640]   A term I don't really like because.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:32.480]   - Yeah.
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.680]   - You know, there aren't circuits for being smart.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.620]   There's circuits for task switching.
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:36.460]   - I get it.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.620]   - But yeah, so it's 10 milligrams of methylene blue
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.000]   combined with, and you've got some other things
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.300]   in the cocktail version that you make.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:42.940]   Take it in the morning on an empty stomach.
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.300]   - Yeah, you could take it with food though.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.660]   Again, it's going to be well absorbed.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.180]   It will, interesting to people,
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.800]   I need to say it will turn your urine green or blue.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.140]   - For how long?
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:53.520]   - About 24 hours, depending.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:54.360]   And.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.180]   - That can be kind of fun.
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:57.900]   - Yeah, well, and a good caveat is if it doesn't,
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:58.980]   and I've had patients,
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.460]   then that's interesting to me as a clinician
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:03.560]   because it means that your mitochondria
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.080]   is not working well, right?
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.580]   The way I see this is you should get spillover.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:09.240]   You shouldn't kind of use it all.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.240]   And if you're not, there's something wrong there
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.000]   that you're using all of it
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.860]   and you're getting no spillover back into your bloodstream,
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:18.320]   which gets filtered into your bladder, your urine,
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.920]   which you urinate out.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.040]   And that's happened with a couple of patients.
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.860]   So it's like, oh, wow, you had no green or blue urine.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:26.440]   There's a problem with your mitochondria.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:31.120]   - So it's putting more oxygen onto the blood cells?
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:31.960]   - Correct.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.100]   Like your hemoglobin is able to pick up more oxygen.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.820]   That's exactly right.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:40.300]   But then there's the, you know, a mild MAOI inhibitor,
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.140]   which is gonna--
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:41.960]   - Monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:44.500]   - Yeah, which is gonna allow things like serotonin
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.880]   to work a little bit longer in that synaptic cleft.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.780]   You know, and you've expounded way better than I can
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:53.940]   about serotonin and dopamine and how those work.
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.540]   But there is a cognitive enhancement from it, for sure.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:48:59.780]   It's very real.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.620]   - Interesting.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.580]   - And we have a lot of people using it and love it.
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.900]   It also seems to be an antiviral.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.580]   You know, you get this, again,
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:08.580]   that's probably through the mitochondria,
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.460]   making your mitochondria more efficient.
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:12.020]   - It's a prescription drug.
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:13.900]   - It's a prescription drug, but there's now,
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.580]   and I don't totally understand it,
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:18.100]   there's now strictly over-the-counter
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:20.780]   nutraceutical supplement options that are methylene blue.
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:24.580]   For sure, anyone can go online and buy it, for sure.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:27.700]   - Well, trust me now that there are gonna be a few.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.380]   - And you talked about turning your mouth blue.
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.940]   If you take a liquid form, right?
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:35.540]   And we'll do that sometimes in the office
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:36.580]   when we're doing other treatments,
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:38.220]   we'll give a big dose of methylene blue
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:41.820]   to kind of help fuel, kind of quickly make a lot of ATP,
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:45.420]   which we wanna do with some different IV treatments we do.
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:46.900]   So we'll give sometimes up to 50,
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:49.180]   five, zero milligrams at a time.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:53.260]   Their gums, teeth, lips are blue for about an hour or two.
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.460]   - And how often can people take methylene blue?
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:59.780]   - Again, you could take it every day.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.440]   I think it's a little bit longer-acting.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.300]   I don't take it every day.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:04.780]   I take it about three times a week.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.740]   I think that's about right.
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:09.260]   I do have people who need it more
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.100]   for whatever they're dealing with.
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:16.100]   I do think as a nutrient, if we're gonna call it that,
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:18.980]   it's a lot of, it's an insurance policy
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:20.680]   for your mitochondria.
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:23.780]   - So earlier you mentioned a patient,
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:25.780]   or maybe it was patients, plural,
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.560]   that experienced a more rapid transition
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.740]   out of a COVID infection,
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:36.100]   or maybe more recovery from long COVID symptoms, et cetera.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:40.160]   It reminded me of the second time I got COVID,
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:45.300]   far less intense than the first time.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:46.820]   But the second time I got COVID,
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.820]   I had an amazing experience
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:52.260]   where my COVID test was very strong band.
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:53.080]   It was very clear.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.380]   Like I had COVID, there was no question about it.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.360]   I didn't feel good.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.500]   I was fatigued.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.720]   It wasn't super severe.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.880]   I would put it kind of on a six out of 10
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.660]   on the kind of malaise level.
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:07.540]   No fever.
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:11.220]   Okay, so I stayed in bed and stayed away from people,
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.160]   this sort of thing.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:17.160]   But I did an NAD infusion.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.340]   I, of course, told them I had COVID.
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.860]   They came over, they gave me an NAD infusion.
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:24.480]   And correlation is not causation,
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.720]   but I think it was 750 milligram NAD infusion
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:31.200]   over the course of about 45 minutes.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:32.940]   I had the usual feelings that one gets
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:34.200]   when you get an NAD infusion,
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:37.480]   if you feel like an elephant is stepping on your legs,
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.720]   your chest kind of cramps up, you feel,
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.940]   and then when that stops,
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.080]   you feel much better than you go into the thing.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:48.160]   The band was absent the next day.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:53.680]   My symptoms were, I went from, I don't want to say gone.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:56.280]   I went from like a five, six out of 10, as I mentioned,
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.240]   to like a two out of 10.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:03.240]   And within another 48 hours, I was good to go and better.
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:05.920]   Now, this is correlation, not causation.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:06.760]   I don't know what was going on.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:08.400]   It could have been the saline bag, right?
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.080]   It could have been any number of things.
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:15.080]   But the shift from a dark band to no band
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:18.220]   was so dramatic that I took another test
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.400]   after the no band.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.320]   And then, of course, the next day and the next day,
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.220]   this kind of thing.
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:25.120]   It's interesting.
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.320]   I don't know what it means,
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.320]   but one wonders whether or not it's just a global way
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.740]   of combating inflammation.
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.740]   You know, I just sort of,
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:38.380]   any time I think about a systemic effect,
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:39.380]   and the reason I raise this
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:40.940]   is that I don't want to give the impression
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.100]   that I think that like NAD is specifically
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.500]   in the pathway that was targeted,
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.600]   but that my brain and body were inflamed.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:49.900]   Clearly, I had an infection.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:51.180]   So you don't, you could have a flu.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:53.140]   You could have a cold, you're inflamed.
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:55.820]   What are your thoughts on that anecdote?
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:57.220]   Again, it's just anecdote,
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.500]   but what are your clinical reflections?
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.900]   - We've seen it so many times.
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.460]   Yeah, I mean, for the longest time,
[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:08.300]   and so we've been using NAD longer than most.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.940]   I'm fortunate that I was given
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:12.260]   the original NAD infusion protocol,
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:13.620]   which came from Mexico.
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:14.460]   It's kind of a long story.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.300]   I don't want to bore you,
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:17.940]   but that dosage of 750 milligrams
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.740]   is actually what we came up with in my office.
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:21.500]   And that's what most people adopted
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.860]   just because we've used it
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:25.620]   more than probably anyone else on the planet.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.980]   Huge fan of NAD, very biased,
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:30.420]   but that's only because I've seen it work
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:34.120]   over and over and over in inexplicable scenarios,
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:35.460]   just like you're describing,
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:38.860]   where it's not just you go from A to B,
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:42.220]   but you're going to A to Z very quickly.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:45.940]   And I used to use the word transformational
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:47.060]   talking about it.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:51.380]   Not just, okay, going from a sick state to a well state,
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.460]   but in most people going from a well state
[01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:56.620]   to a super well state really quickly.
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:58.220]   And it's super impressive.
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:01.420]   So there's a lot more to NAD than we understand, right?
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:03.660]   Because just very empirically giving someone
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:06.660]   this coenzyme, this vitamin B3 derivative,
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:10.660]   how is it dramatically changing symptomatically
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.700]   how someone feels, but it does.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:15.600]   And I've seen it with thousands upon thousands of people,
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.380]   certainly in the setting of COVID,
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.460]   certainly in other bio-infections, you name it.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:23.180]   I have been more impressed with the work of NAD
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:26.260]   than probably any other agent we've ever used.
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.100]   - Amazing.
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:30.220]   Yeah, I take sublingual NMN each day.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.460]   It makes my hair grow ridiculously fast.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:34.420]   I've done the control experiments.
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:36.260]   I'm a scientist, I know how to do control experiments.
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:38.060]   It's still just N of one, it's just me.
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:40.660]   Makes my nails grow really fast, makes my hair grow fast.
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.820]   That's the major consequence.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:43.800]   By the way, I want to be clear.
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.260]   I don't have any stake in any company
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.580]   that sells NAD or NAD infusion.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.280]   So I'm just reporting what I'm reporting.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.820]   - No, I think it's great.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:55.460]   - Somebody who's quite expert in the NAD pathway,
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:59.740]   Charles Brenner, who I believe has a relationship
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:01.420]   to a company that makes NR supplements.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.260]   - I think that's great.
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:03.820]   - Encouraged me to try NR.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:05.980]   I took these NR supplements.
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:09.140]   This is what, it's NAD minus a phosphate group
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:10.140]   is my understanding.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:14.060]   And those I took orally, I couldn't tell
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:15.420]   if I got the same or different effect
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:17.340]   'cause I was taking them together.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:21.060]   I didn't continue to take them because compared to NMN,
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:23.100]   it was very expensive.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:27.180]   And I just stopped taking it.
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.220]   So that's why I use sublingual NMN.
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:33.520]   But in brief discussions with Charles
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.900]   and how we are forging online,
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:37.780]   it seems that there is some literature,
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:39.180]   human clinical literature,
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:41.780]   showing that NR can reduce inflammation.
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:42.600]   Is that right?
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:43.440]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:46.380]   - So there's less data that NMN can reduce inflammation,
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:47.940]   at least lack of human studies.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.780]   Okay, so we're still kind of in the,
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:52.900]   it's still murky, foggy territory
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:56.260]   with respect to the research and clinical.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:57.540]   - The biochemistry.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:55:59.540]   Yeah, and like, what does the biochemistry do?
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:01.300]   And the way I think about it, again,
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:05.220]   'cause we kind of pioneered the infusions, the NAD drips,
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:06.840]   which for me, transformational,
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.820]   just observing lots of people who,
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:12.500]   I never saw the same thing with NMN and NR.
[01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.600]   You're not having these transformational experiences
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.440]   within a week.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.240]   I tell the story a lot is I had a patient,
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:21.680]   he was diagnosed with a chronic Epstein-Barr virus,
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.960]   which is rare, but it does exist.
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.000]   He was depressed and on disability
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.080]   just 'cause he couldn't almost get out of bed.
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:28.920]   - This is mono?
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.720]   - But it was reactivation of Epstein-Barr.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:35.520]   And so very like fatigued and depressed
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:37.440]   and literally on disability, couldn't work.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.480]   And he, I said, before we do anything,
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:42.200]   the way I operate is I want to get you feeling better
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.220]   first before we start to tackle some of the bigger things.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.740]   We did the loading dose of NAD,
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:49.740]   which we came up with five treatments in 10 days.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.560]   Came back to my office, his wife was there, she was crying.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.060]   She goes, "In a week, my husband is back."
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:54.900]   - Wow.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:56.940]   - And I've seen that so many times with NAD
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.320]   and I can't explain it, right?
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.900]   And if I just stick to the biochemistry,
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:00.740]   it doesn't make sense.
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:03.280]   Oh, you're increasing the NAD/NEH ratio,
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.340]   fueling the mitochondria, which are all over the body,
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:06.580]   thousands per cell.
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.140]   There's something that we just told,
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:11.420]   there's gotta be outside the mitochondrial effect of NAD
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.220]   that's not well understood.
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.320]   - So in the backdrop of our conversation today,
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:17.980]   there've been a number of themes,
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:20.180]   but one of the themes that seems to keep coming up
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:22.320]   is that there are a lot of things about medicine
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.160]   that we don't understand.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.300]   - Totally.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.060]   - And yet there are tools that seem to work
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:28.220]   for certain people extremely well.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:31.140]   A few years ago, I went to a meeting.
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:35.160]   This is a foundation meeting, a foundation I was a part of,
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:36.860]   where you get to see talks
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:40.340]   from really the best of the best laboratories.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:42.900]   And they only show unpublished data.
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:45.420]   And at the time, I don't know if this paper's published yet,
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:47.700]   but at the time they were showing that they took people
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.940]   that were diagnosed with major depression.
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:54.900]   And they started doing a bunch of metabolomics on them.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.380]   Now, this sounds pretty standard for social media.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:59.900]   It's actually pretty heretical.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:03.180]   Not a lot of places have done this right.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:06.340]   So a couple thousand patients, blood draws,
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:09.220]   they're trying to figure out, ask a simple question,
[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:12.020]   are there any specific vitamin deficiencies
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.220]   that are associated with depression?
[01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:17.620]   And as I recall, they identified a few different types
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.540]   of vitamin deficiencies.
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.820]   So it's not like one vitamin.
[01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:22.220]   It's not always methylated B6 or something like that,
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:25.620]   or excuse me, it's not always B6 or B12.
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.180]   But they found these clusters of patients
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.900]   that had major depression that were deficient
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:32.940]   in a particular B vitamin.
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:34.540]   They supplemented back the B vitamin,
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:37.580]   and lo and behold, those patients showed remission
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.580]   of their depression.
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:42.640]   So one could conveniently conclude,
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.260]   oh, well, all depression is a B vitamin deficiency,
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:47.140]   but of course that's not true, right?
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:49.540]   More likely depression, like fever,
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:52.380]   is just a broad description of symptoms.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.960]   But what was so exciting about this talk, to me anyway,
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:57.380]   was that people were starting to look
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:00.140]   at nutritional deficiencies as a potential source
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:03.120]   of mental illness, which now has a bit more traction,
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:04.620]   but at the time was like, whoa,
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:05.940]   what are we really saying here?
[01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:08.360]   I thought all of depression was a serotonin deficiency,
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.560]   right, this kind of thing.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:11.980]   So when you talk about NAD having
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.160]   these transformative effects,
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.220]   and the fact that NAD can kind of raise the tide
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:18.220]   on a number of different biological processes,
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:19.940]   to me, it makes perfect sense.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:22.180]   It might've kicked off some mitochondrial pathway
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:25.900]   or some cellular pathway that then fills in a blank
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:27.020]   that's desperately needed.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.900]   Is that one way that we can conceptualize this?
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:29.940]   - That makes total sense to me.
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:30.760]   - Okay. - I like how
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:31.600]   you've described it.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.700]   - So how often do you encourage
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:36.900]   your already healthy patients to do NAD infusions?
[01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:38.060]   What are the dosages?
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.020]   I should mention the NAD infusions,
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:41.980]   for most people, are a little bit costly.
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:42.820]   - They are costly.
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:46.380]   - They're like anywhere from $500 to $1,000.
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:47.220]   - Or more. - Yeah, or more.
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:48.060]   - If you're in Los Angeles, yeah.
[01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.980]   - If you're in Los Angeles.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:51.900]   So assuming someone has the means.
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:53.060]   - Yeah, so here's what we found.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:54.900]   And again, just found it by treating a lot of people
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:59.000]   and learning is we do a loading dose for most people.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.020]   We found the sweet spot to be 750 milligrams.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.680]   - Intravenous. - Intravenous.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:07.760]   When they were doing NAD in the '90s
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:09.500]   and they were doing it for substance abuse,
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.780]   so alcohol, pain medicine, you know, morphine.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:13.700]   - They used it for that?
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:15.380]   - That's where it came from, actually.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:18.060]   It was in the '90s, people traveling to Mexico
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:21.140]   for NAD infusions, that protocol was 10 straight days
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:23.340]   of intravenous NAD, yeah.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.440]   The dose they used was 3,000 milligrams.
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.940]   - 3,000 milligrams? - Yeah, and that's why
[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:28.940]   it took six to eight to 10 hours per infusion.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:30.260]   You could not get through it.
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:33.500]   - Putting 500 milligrams in over the course of 45 minutes
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:35.160]   is gonna be very uncomfortable.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:37.260]   Many people take an anti-nausea med.
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:38.100]   - So I'll tell you about that.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:41.000]   So that comes from, so there was a gentleman in the States
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.240]   in 2006, lived in Louisiana.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:47.160]   He had a pain medicine addiction, went to Mexico,
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:49.360]   got the NAD protocol, changed his life.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.800]   He then licensed the use of the only injectable NAD product,
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.600]   which was from a South African company at the time,
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:56.960]   brought it to the United States,
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.800]   opened a clinic in Atlanta.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:00.480]   All he did was addiction.
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:02.760]   And I got to know him 'cause I'm in Charleston,
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:04.940]   not too far involved in IV work.
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:06.060]   He was not a physician.
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:07.620]   I don't remember the time, but he came to me and said,
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:09.520]   "Hey, I need some help 'cause I'm getting a lot of questions
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:11.300]   "about this NAD stuff."
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:13.020]   And so he handed me the original protocol.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:16.860]   I mean, I'm super grateful and fortunate,
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:19.780]   but what I realized is no one has time
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.120]   to spend six to eight to 10 hours in someone's office.
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.020]   They may do that once,
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:26.160]   but they're not doing it more than once.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:29.980]   So we started trialing different dosages,
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:32.520]   250, 500, 750,000, on up.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.580]   And I just found collectively by watching people
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:37.680]   and how they did, 750 milligrams was a sweet spot,
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:40.260]   meaning they'd get the benefits, which we can talk about,
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:42.440]   but then they could get through it in an hour or two hours.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.900]   And that was meaningful.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:46.320]   And then we found that we don't need 10 straight days.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:47.420]   That's too much.
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:48.940]   That just is crazy.
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:50.940]   We found that five treatments in 10 days,
[02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:55.140]   again, afforded people the ability to have great benefits,
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.280]   which were uniform.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:58.420]   Probably 95% of people who do a loading disc
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:00.500]   will come back and tell you their brain is getting bigger.
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.500]   They feel more creative.
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.180]   They have an elevated mood.
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:05.140]   They can sleep less, but have more energy.
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:06.180]   Colors look brighter.
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:07.620]   Languaging is easier.
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.740]   I mean, this is all very real.
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:11.020]   So I think it affects the nervous system first,
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:12.700]   just 'cause of the concentration of the mitochondria
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:14.500]   for every single neuron in the body.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:17.900]   The physical components, meaning recovery
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:20.360]   and helping with physical exercise, those come,
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.580]   but I think they come later.
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.540]   And so we settled on 750 milligrams.
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:25.820]   We settled on the loading dose.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:27.780]   And then what I noticed is that people were coming back
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:29.220]   between three and four weeks saying,
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:31.500]   hey, I don't feel as good as I did
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:32.940]   after I did that loading dose.
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:36.860]   And so we started doing a once a month maintenance dose.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:39.880]   And that is what we still recommend to today.
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:41.620]   Some people will do less and some people do more.
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:44.060]   I have some people who do it once a week,
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.780]   but plenty of people do it once a month.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:46.720]   And then some people do it quarterly.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:48.280]   Some people do it whenever they can.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:51.140]   On average, once a month seems to work really well
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:51.980]   for people.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:55.300]   Then during the pandemic and realizing this is growing,
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.780]   'cause again, we train practices
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:59.380]   kind of in the medicine that we practice.
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:02.140]   We've trained 300, 350 practices
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:05.100]   and kind of give them the playbook, so to speak.
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.140]   People weren't coming to the office as much with COVID.
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:09.580]   So we started doing it subcutaneously.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:11.180]   And actually that's worked out really well.
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:13.680]   We'll do a hundred milligrams subcutaneously.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:15.940]   Again, five days on, take two days off.
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:17.580]   You get a little bit of that stomach cramping
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:19.820]   from a hundred milligram injection.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:22.180]   Like you said, can't really be absorbed well orally,
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:23.080]   not gonna really work.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.560]   So you're gonna have to inject it or infuse it.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.780]   Agree, there's a price point here, right?
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:31.120]   It's gonna cost money, but like most things,
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:36.840]   to me, if I had to pick one thing for people,
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.520]   engaging in NAD would be it.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:39.360]   - Really?
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.200]   - Yeah, yeah, I would.
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.020]   - Of all the things we've discussed.
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:41.860]   - Of all the things.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.320]   I've just been so impressed over the years.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.000]   Now, peptides are amazing.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.040]   Not to knock peptides, peptides.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.360]   There's so many peptides and I will get there, right?
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.760]   Because you can take this peptide for the nervous system,
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.200]   this peptide for the immune system,
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:56.240]   but collectively one agent, one thing,
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.320]   it's NAD has been the most impactful
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.160]   from where I sit working with patients.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.760]   - Well, that's a significant statement.
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.200]   So a hundred milligrams injected subcutaneously,
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:07.600]   you get a little bit of stomach cramping.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.420]   - Yes.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:11.000]   - As compared to the 500 milligrams to 750
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.440]   or a thousand milligrams that one brings in IV.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.320]   The fastest I've ever dripped it in
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:19.200]   was I think like 40 minutes.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.240]   - I can tell you the record.
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:21.160]   - What's the record?
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:22.900]   - Three minutes and 26 seconds.
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:23.740]   - Is that you?
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.240]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:26.080]   - What are 500 milligrams?
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.560]   - 750 milligrams, two separate people did it.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:32.360]   500 CCs of saline, three minutes, 26 seconds.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:33.200]   - Wow.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:34.080]   - It's insane.
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.520]   - Yeah, I don't recommend it.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.140]   - No, no, we wouldn't allow it to happen.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:37.980]   It's too much.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.360]   You got to have a lot of experience with NAD.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.040]   - Yeah, I found that because you have to sit there
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.920]   for a while, you could think, okay, well,
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:47.880]   do you organize the plumbing correctly
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:50.040]   that you could type or something, but you feel-
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:50.880]   - It's hard.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.200]   - Nudged enough during the infusion that you get irritable.
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.680]   It's actually a very interesting window
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.560]   into empathy for people who have pain.
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.400]   - Totally.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.360]   - You know, when you're in this kind of whole body
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.840]   kind of systemic pain and discomfort
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:08.960]   and you gain that saliva, I'm kind of sensing it now.
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.560]   I have a distinct memory of this.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.920]   Kind of like for people that get seasick,
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:12.960]   you think about being on a boat
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:16.240]   and walking back and forth, get a little nauseous.
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:18.480]   Someone would walk in the room and you're like,
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.160]   God, why are they walking like that?
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:21.000]   - Right.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.780]   - You know, and it's your own, it's your sense of pain.
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:25.840]   I normally don't have that response to people.
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.440]   I'm not a moody person in general, but then, you know,
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.400]   when you remove the infusion, you feel great.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:33.720]   And all of a sudden people seem delightful.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.760]   The irritating person, it's a very interesting experiment
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.240]   in social empathy.
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:40.960]   - It is, and this is just what I postulate
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:43.240]   is that a lot of people are challenged
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:47.520]   because a lot of people are numb to the world they live in.
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.920]   They don't feel things.
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:52.100]   And when you do NAD, there is nothing like that experience
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:53.320]   and that feeling.
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:56.120]   And so you are going to just psychologically say,
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.800]   something is changing inside of me.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.480]   And it's something powerful 'cause it's,
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:02.200]   when I receive it, it's a lot.
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:05.200]   And to your point, what we do is we have a kind of an IV room
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:07.960]   where we have like eight chairs and we make it social.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.280]   Because when you're talking to people
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.320]   and learning about their experiencing it,
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:12.920]   there's actually a lot of healing that occurs
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.440]   just from that community.
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:15.920]   - That's a rebounding experiment.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:16.840]   - It is. - Experiment.
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:18.060]   - Yeah.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:20.800]   - For people that can't afford the infusions,
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:23.240]   the injections would be the next best bet.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:24.760]   If they can't afford those,
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:26.560]   would it be the sublingual NMN or NR?
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:27.400]   - I think so.
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:28.240]   I think the NMN.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.120]   I would choose over NR.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:31.960]   - Yeah, so going from most expensive to least expensive,
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:34.860]   most expensive would be IV.
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:37.280]   Then it would be subcutaneous.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:39.960]   Then it would be NR.
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.000]   And then it would be a sublingual NMN.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:42.960]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:43.780]   - That's about right.
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:45.840]   I mean, you could do NAD topically.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.620]   It's a little bit wildcard doing it topically.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:50.460]   You could do it under your, yeah, patch.
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.900]   - The antiphretic patches.
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.300]   Those give me a really terrible--
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:54.500]   - The problem is the patch.
[02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:56.140]   - I get this itchy thing. - It's the patch.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.460]   It's the adhesive.
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:58.540]   It's too strong.
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:06:59.820]   Lots of people get irritated.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:01.340]   Their skin gets irritated.
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:02.540]   I think the NAD gets in well,
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:06.540]   but the patch itself is a hindrance, obstacle.
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:08.460]   - And for those that are listening to this,
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:10.380]   and they may recall,
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:13.780]   I did an episode of this podcast with Dr. Peter Attia,
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:16.280]   where we talked about NAD and NMN and NR.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:19.760]   And that was mainly focused on the research literature.
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:21.160]   You're not gonna find much.
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:25.000]   So what we're talking about here is clinical experience.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.440]   - Yeah, full disclosure.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:27.760]   I'm a clinician through and through.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.120]   So my experience is observing people.
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:32.340]   - And you're interested in what works.
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:35.880]   - Well, but I'm confident about it
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:37.900]   because I've done a lot of it.
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:40.600]   I've seen a lot of how peptides work
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.800]   'cause we've done a lot of it.
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:44.140]   This NAD, 'cause we've overseen, again,
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:47.160]   a lot of NAD here and in London, all over,
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.000]   and the providers we work with.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.360]   So we get a lot of feedback about what works
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.460]   and what doesn't work.
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:58.680]   - Speaking of clinicians and science and all of this,
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.840]   there are a couple other peptides
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:03.240]   that have received FDA approval
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.480]   that are commonly in use, things like PT-141,
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:12.480]   which is in this melanocyte hormone pathway that's used.
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:17.320]   One of its FDA-approved uses is,
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.520]   I think the brand name is Vilese,
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:22.160]   is for female hypolibido.
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:23.840]   So it stimulates libido in women.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.860]   It's also used to stimulate libido in men.
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:26.700]   Is that right?
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:28.280]   - It can be, and it can be helpful for,
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:32.480]   it's like a neurogenic mechanism for erectile dysfunction.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.840]   - So it's not just related to blood flow.
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.520]   - It's not, actually.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.600]   It's not, and PT-141, yeah,
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:41.860]   like a fragment or derivative of the peptide melanotan,
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:45.320]   which stimulates alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone,
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:48.920]   which is becoming more in play, I guess,
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:50.200]   in the environment I operate in
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:51.920]   just because of mold toxicity.
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.360]   And we think of mold toxicity being a biotoxin
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:58.240]   and hitting MSH being kind of the general
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:01.240]   in terms of a lot of these hormonal pathways, actually.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:03.280]   And melanotan can bolster
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.440]   by putting out more melanocyte stimulating hormone.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.620]   It seems to bolster immune response.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:10.320]   I think there's an element with energy, too.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.840]   The downside of melanotan is it stimulates melanocytes,
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:15.520]   so you're gonna get this tanning.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:16.800]   And it's not like a,
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:20.080]   it's like an orange-looking tanning.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.200]   - From the inside out.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.520]   - Yeah, you see it, you recognize it.
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:25.760]   So PT-141, what they found is in rats,
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:29.080]   I think it was female rats were copulating more
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:30.560]   when they got this compound.
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.640]   And they're like, "Oh, cool, and let's try it in humans."
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.360]   And it's led to that.
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:36.320]   Our trouble with it is a very small
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.520]   or narrow therapeutic window.
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:39.680]   And if you give too much,
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.120]   you're gonna get nauseous pretty quickly.
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.440]   And some people don't like,
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:45.840]   particularly women, don't like that tanning look.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:46.680]   It's not a very-
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:48.120]   - It can look very unnatural.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.120]   - Unnatural is the word.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:50.520]   - Yeah, the medial pituitary,
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:53.360]   which at least my understanding is the origin
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.240]   of these peptides that we're talking about now
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.400]   is super interesting.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:57.920]   And you mentioned the nausea.
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:00.440]   These peptides hit multiple pathways.
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.880]   When we had Dr. Zachary Knight
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:03.720]   from University of California, San Francisco
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:07.280]   want to talk about GLP-1 in a lot of detail.
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.480]   He mentioned that some of the nausea associated
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:14.160]   with Ozempic and Menjaro and things like that
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.560]   relates to the fact that there are receptors
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:18.400]   for these things,
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.320]   not just in one hypothalamic structure,
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.080]   but also in area postrema and areas of the brain
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:26.080]   that are these "primitive areas"
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:28.160]   that are associated with generating nausea
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.040]   when you need to rid yourself of a poison
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.080]   that nature conveniently engineered us with neurons
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.160]   that, when they detect chemical changes in the blood,
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:37.200]   make us vomit.
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.160]   - Yeah, and to touch on that is what we found is
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:41.880]   if we start with, again, a microdose
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:45.080]   and go slowly with the GLP-1s,
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.120]   the nausea is virtually unheard of.
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:48.560]   Not saying it doesn't occur,
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.040]   but it's super rare if you just take your time with it.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:52.240]   I think when people have most problems,
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.960]   they're shotgunning the dose, essentially.
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:57.400]   You're overwhelming your system.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:58.560]   - So I have two more questions.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.320]   The first one is a bit of a controversial one.
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:06.800]   Today we've talked about a lot of peptides
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:10.960]   that you've observed incredible clinical utility for.
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:13.760]   We also talked about a lot of peptides
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:17.840]   that the FDA has banned, basically, to be blunt.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.520]   We've also talked about peptides
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.960]   that at one point not too long ago
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:26.600]   were considered part of kind of niche culture,
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.480]   like fitness or bodybuilding culture
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.000]   that are now approaching
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.280]   what will probably be trillion dollar industries
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:35.560]   over the next 10 years, things like GLP-1 agonists.
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:40.120]   So any listener with their neurons firing
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.360]   will put two and two together and say,
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.880]   "Okay, what's the deal?"
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:45.040]   Obviously the FDA, I like to believe,
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.840]   has a genuine interest in our safety.
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:49.800]   They don't want us taking things that are dangerous for us.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.320]   At the same time,
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.200]   there seems to be a kind of clawing back of what's out there
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.040]   and then a handing off to pharmaceutical companies
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.560]   to put out compounds
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:01.240]   for which there are tremendous profit margins.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:04.120]   I mean, the profit margins on these are insane.
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:04.960]   - We can't comprehend it.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:06.320]   - You can't comprehend it.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:11.080]   So, you know, MK-677, I crossed out, right?
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:12.880]   The FDA grabbed that one.
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:14.640]   Thymosin Alpha-1, crossed out.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:18.000]   Okay, a bunch of other things that have been,
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.080]   BPC-157, clawed back.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:25.440]   So how should we frame this in our mind?
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.840]   In other words, do you think that the FDA
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.520]   has genuine good intentions
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:30.920]   of trying to protect the general public
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.160]   and that's why they're doing this?
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.160]   Or is this a plan to kind of make that appear to be the case
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.800]   so that these can then be sold
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:42.280]   at a very, very high profit margin?
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:43.600]   And perhaps it could be both, right?
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:44.560]   It's not an either or.
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:47.340]   And I want to be very clear, you know,
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.520]   I work at a major medical school,
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:51.640]   but I'll speak freely anyway, right?
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:53.520]   You know, as would my colleagues.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:55.760]   Like, I like to think that these governing bodies
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.520]   have some people there at least with very good intentions.
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:12:59.360]   - Sure.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.440]   - I don't think it's a bunch of bad people,
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:01.660]   like, writhing their hands together
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:03.000]   with getting kickbacks on pharma.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.360]   I don't believe that.
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:06.240]   In fact, I know that not to be the case.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:07.720]   But like, what's really going on here?
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:08.920]   Because this is kind of weird.
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:12.320]   There's this huge class of compounds we call peptides
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:15.800]   that clearly have immensely beneficial uses
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:17.200]   in the right dosage, in the right hands,
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.600]   with the right physicians.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:19.900]   They're being clawed back.
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:21.700]   Why?
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:22.800]   - It's confusing.
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:24.360]   I think it's probably both.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.640]   I think, you know, I would say that unfortunately,
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:31.560]   a lot of times when the government acts, they overreach.
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:32.380]   Right?
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:33.520]   Like, I do think they probably have good intentions.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.140]   I think there's probably sound reasons
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:40.200]   to want to have oversight of things
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.880]   that seemingly is the wild, wild west, right?
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:44.900]   And there's truth to that, right?
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:47.140]   Because peptides came on the scene
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:48.760]   and people started using them.
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:49.920]   They're recommended here and there.
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:52.960]   People could get them from, still can, research companies.
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:55.680]   And there's not a lot of corralling of understanding,
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.920]   well, what is going on?
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:00.160]   So I'm sure there's an element to like,
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:02.800]   hey, let's understand this better.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.720]   But on that side, I think they went too far, right?
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:08.040]   Because I think if you really look at data
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.240]   or if you were really interested in that,
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:13.440]   there's ways to understand how things work
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:17.080]   without removing them from the marketplace.
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.520]   So the other side of me is like,
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:21.440]   just like we're talking about,
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:25.400]   Ozempic and Mangiorno, semi-glutide and terzepatide,
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:27.800]   are blockbuster drugs.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.680]   If you're a pharmaceutical company
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:32.600]   and you see that there's 15 to 20 other peptides,
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:34.840]   which are really working and really working,
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.240]   'cause again, we've just seen the clinical response
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.040]   over and over and over, it's not a large leap to think,
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.600]   hey, if we're a pharmaceutical company,
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:46.720]   what if we turn that peptide,
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.040]   which was available to the commoner,
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:51.380]   for lack of a better term, into a drug?
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:52.860]   - Oh, like Vilesi.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:56.160]   That was done for melanocytes simulating hormone pathways.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:57.000]   - Yeah.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.320]   And so I'm sure, I think it's both.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.600]   I think, and that's why I go back to,
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:06.520]   we have to operate within certain boundaries, right?
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.080]   Like that's great.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:09.240]   We have to understand those boundaries.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.600]   It would be, and I say this sincerely,
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.680]   I don't, when we're talking about healthcare
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:15.960]   and we're talking about people's health,
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:18.820]   we're not even close to talking about the truth
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:20.240]   for most things, right?
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:22.520]   We're not talking about why people get chronic disease.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:23.680]   We're not talking about how our food
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:25.160]   is really over-processed
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.640]   and the availability of high quality nutrients
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:28.480]   and what that means.
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:30.120]   We're not talking about all the toxicities.
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.560]   We just look at Roundup, glyphosate and its interference
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.400]   with so many pathways in the body.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:38.680]   And people say, you know, and Monsanto and whoever
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.720]   runs that now saying it's so safe and it's just not true.
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:44.280]   So I think it's in line with,
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:47.120]   and what I support is unfortunately,
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.060]   and fortunately as an individual,
[02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:50.840]   you have to be your own best advocate.
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:53.680]   You can't rely on someone to say,
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.580]   particularly the government,
[02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.520]   that you have permission or not permission to do this.
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:00.300]   You think it's best for people to do their own research,
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:03.120]   you know, seek out reliable information, right?
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:04.040]   Start here.
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.120]   I mean, you guys vet so much stuff,
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:07.760]   very safe place for people to be like,
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:09.240]   this is where I want to start.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.760]   And then life is, you learn by exploring
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.640]   and seeing what works for you.
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:15.040]   It's like, you start with a recipe to cook, right?
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:16.240]   But some people like it saltier.
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:17.580]   Some people like it spicier.
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.520]   You gotta see what works best for you.
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.480]   And that's why I seek out other people,
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:24.000]   people like myself, other physicians,
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.520]   other people who have experience saying,
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:28.400]   hey, we'll help you, guide you in this.
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.360]   And that's where the magic happens.
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:33.360]   But to be honest, we're not being truthful in many levels
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.500]   when we talk about health.
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:38.020]   We're just not, we spend so much money for what?
[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:40.440]   We're not making a dent in chronic disease.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:41.800]   We're not making an impact.
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:44.320]   We're not helping people lead better lives.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.100]   You know, medicine is great for life and death things.
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:49.940]   It really is.
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:51.920]   You know, I, in 2000, in August of 2020,
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:53.920]   I had terrible abdominal pain.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:56.760]   I had just come back from visiting our friends in Hawaii.
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:59.360]   I kind of tried to treat myself unsuccessfully.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.080]   I eventually was on labor day.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:02.960]   I had so much pain the next day.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.160]   Called my friend who's a radiologist,
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:06.160]   said I need to do a CAT scan.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.640]   I did the CAT scan.
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:08.940]   He called me on the way back to the office.
[02:17:08.940 --> 02:17:12.360]   I had a blood clot in the vein going to my liver
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:13.880]   that had completely cut off.
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:14.720]   I almost died.
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:15.680]   Like it was really serious.
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:16.800]   I had to be hospitalized.
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:18.120]   I'm on blood thinners now.
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:21.480]   I am forever grateful for pharmaceuticals.
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:23.380]   Saved my life, right?
[02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:25.160]   But those same medicines aren't probably gonna
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.120]   help me lead my best life, right?
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:29.240]   And there's, it's challenging.
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:31.320]   Having been educated in a very formal,
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:32.520]   conventional medical system,
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:34.840]   which is dominated by the pharmaceutical industry
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:36.460]   is a problem, right?
[02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:38.760]   We go back to the Flexner Report,
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:42.580]   which is like 1917, 1915 or something,
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:44.480]   where they studied medical education
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:46.920]   and basically said if you're a medical school
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.480]   and you're not promoting pharmaceuticals and inline,
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:52.780]   and we're gonna kick out alternative remedies
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:54.240]   and modalities like chiropractic
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.080]   and acupuncture and nutrition,
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:57.560]   they don't count anymore.
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:58.720]   And that's where we are.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:17:59.720]   The only thing that matters,
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:01.240]   and we see it as a society,
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:04.000]   we're deemed healthy by the pills we take, right?
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.440]   If we're gonna be really honest,
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:07.940]   those pills aren't making us healthy.
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:10.500]   And by and large, they're not even making us well anymore.
[02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:11.340]   You know what I mean?
[02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:13.140]   And so I think it's time,
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:15.260]   and it's wonderful to have this forum
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:16.180]   to be able to talk about.
[02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:17.780]   Like, and this is why I support
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.040]   so many other people talking about it.
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.300]   Like, we need to make a change in that.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:23.660]   We need to start being honest about what we're doing.
[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:26.100]   Our health is not gonna be coming from doctors
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:28.280]   saying taking this pill or that potion.
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:29.900]   It's not, not at this stage.
[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:32.220]   And it's more likely that people are gonna feel healthy
[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:34.220]   from seeing their trainer in their gym, right?
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:35.900]   These, why do these things go to the gray market
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:36.740]   or black market?
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:38.460]   'Cause people actually get results.
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:39.300]   You know what I mean?
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:41.020]   And it's just sad, but true.
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:43.060]   And so to answer your question, I think it's both.
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:44.980]   I think the pharmaceutical companies are greedy.
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:47.240]   I think they like making money, right?
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:50.220]   I think they also like helping people, right?
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:54.260]   They want to help people, but it comes with a big cost.
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:57.460]   And the government's there to kind of corral that.
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:18:58.860]   But like most things the government does,
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:00.540]   they go too far, right?
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:03.680]   And I think we need to be honest about those discussions.
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:05.700]   And it's not threatening and it's not harmful
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:08.740]   just to be saying, hey, how do we make this better?
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:11.260]   And how do we even agree to disagree?
[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:12.420]   Let's just start there.
[02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:14.820]   - I really appreciate your take.
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:18.460]   I too rely on prescription drugs now and again.
[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:19.860]   I don't know, maybe I'll lose some following
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:23.740]   for saying this, but like I've had some situations
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:26.780]   where it made sense to like take an antibiotic,
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:28.860]   like after a surgery or something or like,
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:31.180]   I'm not like anti-antibiotics, right?
[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:34.180]   I also don't take, I also don't eat them like M&Ms.
[02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:38.720]   I also believe that, well, everything you said,
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:40.560]   I generally agree with.
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:42.680]   I don't have the clinical expertise or the nuance
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:44.280]   to really understand these governing bodies.
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:45.840]   That's one of the reasons why I'm asking today
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:48.560]   and really appreciate you shedding light on this.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.000]   I think you're clearly a truth teller.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.480]   You're telling us your truth from the clinical perspective,
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:58.400]   but it's clear you also have a broad optics here.
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:00.360]   We appreciate that.
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:01.200]   - Sure.
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:03.040]   - Yeah, this podcast has always been about bringing
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:06.640]   diverse outlooks on the same things.
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.840]   And it's been wonderful today to be able to explore
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:13.340]   peptides, NAD, and this issue of FDA approval
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:16.840]   and FDA removal as the case may be.
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:19.280]   You said something earlier a couple of times
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:21.620]   that I'd like to finish up on.
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:25.200]   Talked about positive thoughts.
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:28.640]   You're a physician, not a psychologist,
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.480]   but you're a physician.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:33.560]   And you're in the business of making people feel better.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:37.080]   And it's clear to me that among your many talents,
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:39.500]   you have great powers of observation.
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:42.660]   So what is this thing about positive thoughts?
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:44.920]   I mean, there are a lot of neuro immunological data
[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:48.780]   out there showing that stress makes us sick.
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:52.200]   If we stress too long, repeatedly for too long,
[02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:55.000]   stress in the short period is actually good for us, right?
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.040]   There are some data showing that positive thoughts
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.040]   can enhance immune system function, et cetera.
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:01.300]   The data are pretty cool.
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:05.520]   Clinically, however, what's your observation
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:08.040]   about mindset and health?
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:09.720]   - I think we're just scratching the surface.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:13.200]   And I think it is the most profound way
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:14.460]   to affect your life, right?
[02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:16.680]   So there's a couple of things I'll say about it.
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:20.220]   One, no good has ever come from a negative thought.
[02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:23.240]   Nothing ever good has come from a negative thought.
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.940]   And because all of us have a choice
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:29.240]   about every decision we make,
[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:32.460]   to me, it's always best to make a,
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:34.680]   to slant that decision in a positive frame.
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:37.440]   Now it doesn't mean you're fake about it, right?
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:38.840]   People really suffer.
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:40.400]   People really go, I mean,
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:42.680]   it is a very stressful time right now.
[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:45.080]   Maybe the most stressful time in human history.
[02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:48.240]   And there's no need to gloss over it and saying life is,
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:49.320]   you know, peaches and cream
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:51.520]   'cause it's not for a lot of people.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.280]   But what I know just personally and professionally
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:57.660]   is that when you start pivoting towards positivity,
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:21:59.620]   you get more positivity, right?
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:02.100]   And all of us, every single human
[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:04.060]   has that opportunity to do that.
[02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:07.020]   That some people it's way harder choices.
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:09.100]   They are dealt a much more challenging
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:11.040]   and difficult hand, lots of people.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:12.060]   But if we think about it,
[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:13.340]   we didn't get to choose our eye color.
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:14.660]   We didn't get to choose our family.
[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:16.000]   We didn't get to choose where we were born
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.860]   or how we were brought up.
[02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:20.900]   But we do get to choose how we respond to those things.
[02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:23.160]   And so what I've learned is the more,
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:25.680]   there's never enough positivity I can exude.
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:28.780]   There's never enough positivity I can be around
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:30.020]   ever in my life.
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:32.140]   It is just the most amazing thing
[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:34.540]   and it can never be taken from you, right?
[02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:36.480]   And so when we talk about success
[02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:38.840]   and longevity and healthspan,
[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:41.820]   to me positivity has to be a part of that
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:44.300]   because the mindset of positivity
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:48.660]   will override almost everything, literally.
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:50.500]   And I can't tell you how that happens
[02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:52.920]   on a biochemical or physiologic basis,
[02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:54.780]   but I know it to be a truth.
[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:57.620]   I know it in the core of my being
[02:22:57.620 --> 02:22:59.580]   that the more positive I am,
[02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:01.420]   the more I can influence other people
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:05.040]   and plant seeds and help people be more positive.
[02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:08.540]   And that is something that I cherish and just love.
[02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:09.840]   And it's not talked about enough.
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:11.620]   You know, especially as a physician,
[02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:12.740]   we're talking about the science
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:15.100]   and oh, this study and, you know,
[02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:17.300]   putting people on this medicine.
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:18.360]   But really the value,
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:21.380]   and I made this decision back in 2010
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:23.440]   'cause I had my own practice
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:26.000]   and I decided to stop taking insurance.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.680]   And it wasn't a money thing.
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.720]   It wasn't like, oh,
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:31.080]   it was because I was no longer valuable
[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:33.200]   taking five to seven minutes with each person
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:34.580]   and seeing 40 patients a day.
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:38.680]   And for me, I felt like I'm not fulfilling my purpose here
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:40.580]   when I'm just writing prescriptions.
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:41.920]   That my purpose will be fulfilled
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:44.400]   if I can really have conversations
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:46.000]   where I get to know people.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:47.900]   And peptides and NAD tie into that
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:51.440]   because they are gateways to build trust with me
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:54.920]   so that I can actually help you, an individual,
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:56.360]   learn how to be more positive
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:59.200]   and to slant yourself and have that posture.
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:02.080]   Because ultimately all of us need the energy
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:04.400]   and want the energy to find our purpose, right?
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:06.560]   And once you find that purpose,
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:08.920]   oh my goodness, life gets magical, right?
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:09.920]   'Cause we're all unique.
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:12.320]   We all have a different DNA structure.
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:15.440]   God gave us that to be unique, to shine our light,
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:18.220]   to contribute, to help others.
[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:19.340]   Most people don't know about that
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:21.140]   'cause they're in pain or they're tired
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.440]   or whatever, they're suffering.
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:26.100]   And if we can help walk people through that
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:30.240]   and help them heal that, that's gonna get really good.
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:32.000]   And that's just what I enjoy doing.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.260]   - Beautifully said and so grateful to you
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:38.500]   for doing that within your clinical practice,
[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:40.300]   for making that decision a few years back
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:43.180]   to shift over to being aligned with your purpose
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:47.560]   and the way that you've now expanded your practice
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.280]   to public education.
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.880]   We'll provide links to your practice
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:53.080]   and to your public education efforts.
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:55.560]   And for coming here to do this
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:58.640]   significant public education effort
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:02.400]   about peptides and other compounds and regulatory bodies
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:04.200]   and also just the field of medicine.
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.460]   And also just, I think so often we hear from scientists
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:11.440]   or from physicians and we forget the human component
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.000]   and what's so beautiful about what you do
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.080]   and the way you do it
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:19.360]   is that your humanity really comes through.
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:20.200]   - Oh, I appreciate that.
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:23.080]   - So it really does, I can tell you really care.
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:26.520]   And I know our listeners and viewers can tell as well.
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.560]   So as this field evolves and advances,
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.240]   please come back and talk to us again.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:34.960]   Meanwhile, again, we'll provide links
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:36.480]   so that people can find you
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:38.240]   and some of the resources
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:40.720]   that back up what we've discussed today.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:44.440]   And Craig, Dr. Conover, thank you ever so much.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:45.280]   - Well, thank you, Andrew.
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.680]   No, it's really, I'm so honored to be here.
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:49.840]   I respect and love the work you're doing
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:53.120]   and the light you're shining and you're helping so many.
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.880]   You have such a wide audience that trust you
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:59.520]   and it's amazing.
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:02.320]   Like I said, I see it every day with people coming to me
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.920]   and bouncing what you do and saying,
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:06.620]   "Hey, is this good for me?"
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:08.720]   And that is amazing, I love that.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:10.080]   That's how we get better, right?
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:11.440]   We help support each other
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.300]   and I just appreciate what you're doing
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:16.080]   and being here is truly an honor,
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:17.840]   really a big deal for me, so thank you.
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:19.960]   - Thank you, I'll take that in and write back at you.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:21.120]   - Okay. - Come back again.
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:21.960]   - I appreciate it.
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:22.920]   - I appreciate you.
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:23.800]   - Thank you.
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.960]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.280]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:16.000]   I do read all the comments.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.140]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:18.340]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:19.960]   It's my very first book.
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:21.360]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:23.520]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:24.680]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:25.840]   for more than five years,
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.160]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:29.720]   of research and experience.
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:32.760]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:35.260]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:37.720]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:41.080]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:43.160]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.040]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:49.440]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:51.200]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:52.960]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:55.560]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.520]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:00.520]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:03.100]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:04.960]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.520]   And on all those platforms,
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:08.640]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:10.160]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:11.600]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.480]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:14.680]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:17.740]   Again, that's @hubermanlab on all social media channels.
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:18.880]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:20.680]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:22.080]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.120]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:25.680]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:27.840]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:29.620]   one-to-three-page PDFs.
[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:32.120]   Those protocol PDFs are on things like
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:33.760]   neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.360]   optimizing dopamine, improving your sleep,
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:38.520]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:40.600]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:42.760]   that describes a template routine
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:44.280]   that includes cardiovascular training
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:46.240]   and resistance training with sets and reps,
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:47.680]   all backed by science,
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.080]   and all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:52.680]   To subscribe, simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:55.300]   go to the Menu tab up in the upper right corner,
[02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:57.400]   scroll down to Newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:59.080]   And I should emphasize that we do not share
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:00.680]   your email with anybody.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:02.000]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.800]   for today's discussion with Dr. Craig Conover.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.080]   And last but certainly not least,
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:09.080]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:14.500]   you
