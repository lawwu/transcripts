[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280]   Today we have a question every parent
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.760]   must answer for themselves.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.160]   How do I not exasperate my children?
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.840]   It's today's question from a young dad,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.120]   a new dad named Matt.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.240]   He writes, "Hello Pastor Jon,
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.060]   "and thank you for taking my question today.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480]   "Colossians 3.21 warns fathers,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.280]   "do not embitter your children."
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.680]   That's the NIV.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.120]   "Or do not provoke your children."
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.800]   That's the ESV and King James Version.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.640]   "Or do not exasperate your children."
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.440]   That's the Holman Bible.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.520]   "We are to avoid embittering or provoking
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.400]   "or exasperating our children,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.020]   "so they do not become discouraged."
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.360]   So what does it look like for a father
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.920]   to embitter his children?
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840]   This text seems super important to me as a new dad,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.920]   and at the same time, super abstract.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   What would this look like, Pastor Jon?
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.880]   - Well, I've given a lot of thought
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.920]   to this question recently
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.960]   because I've been working my way through Colossians
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.800]   and look at the book,
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.320]   and so let me see if I can hold down my enthusiasm
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.760]   for it to 10 minutes or so here.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   Let's put the text in front of us
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   with enough context to make sure we can get this dad
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.640]   in the right frame of mind.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.720]   Wives, I'm starting at verse 18 of Colossians 3.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   "Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.340]   "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.560]   "Children, obey your parents in everything,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.860]   "for this pleases the Lord.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580]   "Fathers, do not provoke your children,"
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.100]   or embitter your children,
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.800]   "lest they become discouraged."
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.660]   Now, the reason I give that much context for verse 21,
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.860]   which says, "Fathers, do not provoke your children
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.140]   "lest they become discouraged,"
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.740]   is that I want fathers, I want Matt,
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.860]   to feel the amazing responsibility
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.460]   that God gives in a special way to fathers.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.020]   And the reason I say special way
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.060]   is because verse 20 says that children
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.880]   are to be obedient to their parents,
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.420]   not just their fathers.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.300]   Children, obey your parents in everything,
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.620]   for this pleases the Lord.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.900]   But when it gets to verse 23,
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.180]   and the peculiar responsibility
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.460]   for the children's encouragement,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.820]   he does not say, "Parents, do not provoke your children."
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.940]   He says, "Fathers, do not provoke your children."
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.660]   And of course, mothers shouldn't provoke their children
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.420]   and discourage them either,
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   but he gives the fathers this peculiar responsibility
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.000]   in a special way.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.840]   So, dad is the head of the family.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.480]   And the reason I say that is because in verse 18,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.080]   it says, "Wives, submit to your own husbands."
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.320]   So, if children are to be obedient to mom,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.640]   and mom is to submit to dad,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.460]   then there's a peculiar burden of responsibility
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.700]   that God places on dad to lead the family.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.480]   And he is to lead it in a way that is first,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.720]   not harsh with his wife,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.960]   and second, not discouraging to his children.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.880]   So, dad's call not to discourage his children
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.600]   is part of a larger fabric
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   of his peculiar husbandly, fatherly responsibility.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.660]   And I emphasize the word responsibility
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.160]   rather than rights,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.080]   because that's the tone of the passage.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   That's the tone of reality.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   God gives to husbands and fathers
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.560]   a burden of responsibility.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.340]   This isn't a place for the blustering
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.440]   of a man's rights as head.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   This is a place for bearing the peculiar burden
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560]   of responsibility as husbands and fathers.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.800]   And you can see it is a daunting,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.880]   and I would say even impossible,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   in one sense, responsibility to so deal with our children
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.940]   that they don't become dispirited,
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.740]   or discouraged, or lifeless.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.960]   This involves a work of God, not just man.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.400]   The translations include,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.700]   don't exasperate your children,
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.940]   don't provoke them to anger,
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.000]   don't embitter them.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.200]   Those are all the translations that you see
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.080]   in the versions that are out there.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   But the general idea is this.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.560]   Since verse 20 says that children should obey
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.420]   the fathers and mothers,
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.180]   the father should not back away
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.480]   from requiring obedience
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.660]   just because a child tries to use pouting
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.540]   to coerce dad not to make him go to bed
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.540]   when it's time to go to bed.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.100]   Verse 21, don't discourage your children,
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.900]   can't be used to nullify verse 20,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.380]   which calls us to require obedience from our children.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.540]   So children can't blackmail their parents
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.980]   into canceling out verse 20,
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.120]   because they say, look, dad,
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.580]   you're not supposed to discourage me.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.700]   I'm feeling discouraged,
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.980]   and so you can't require that of me.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.000]   You can't do that with the Bible.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.420]   So verse 21 must be saying,
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.840]   there is a wrong or a counterproductive way
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.620]   to require obedience of your children,
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.280]   which only discourages.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.460]   And there's a helpful way
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.220]   to require obedience of your children.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.420]   And the command to dads
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.660]   not to provoke our children to discouragement
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.500]   can't be used to make the dad passive or lazy
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.460]   or indifferent to the children's misbehavior.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.060]   So what I take Matt to be asking is this,
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.060]   what does it look like when you are requiring obedience,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.680]   like verse 20 says you should,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.380]   but doing it badly
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.660]   so that you're knocking the spirit out of your child?
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.900]   So let me direct Matt and the rest of us
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.920]   to these eight ways that I would describe
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.880]   for how not to require obedience of your children.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.400]   So as I thought,
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.240]   how does ways of fathering
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.040]   knock the life out of a child,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.080]   discourage a child, dispirit the child?
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.040]   And I've got eight of them.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.120]   I'll just name them briefly.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.500]   First, don't try to get obedience by nagging.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.040]   The word nagging was invented
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.440]   because there is such a thing as a repetitive demand
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.360]   or repetitive requirement that are really annoying
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.520]   and exasperating because they are demeaning.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.760]   Like you feel like I've heard you say that three times now,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.420]   I'm going to do it in the timeframe you gave me.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.240]   You don't need to keep telling me to do this.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.720]   That's what the child might be feeling
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.440]   if he's not even saying it.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.840]   So don't require obedience by nagging.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.020]   Number two, don't try to get obedience
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.320]   by being the kind of dad that only demands.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.960]   I mean, demand, demand, demand, demand.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.080]   And he never has a conversation with child.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.680]   He never gives a compliment to the child,
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.740]   he never celebrates anything with the child,
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.440]   he never explains anything to the child.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.720]   All the child ever hears is do, do, do, do, do,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.640]   demand, demand, demand, demand.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   So make your requirements part of the fabric
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.560]   of a much richer communication with your child
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.600]   so he knows you are more than a demander.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   Third, don't try to get obedience by setting the tone
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.180]   where every requirement sounds angry.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.840]   Dad's always angry.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.200]   He doesn't know how to give any cheerful requirements.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   He thinks that in order to get anything done,
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   he has to sound harsh and mad.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.940]   Well, dad, you don't.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.280]   That's counterproductive, that's discouraging.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   Fourth, don't try to get obedience by always using blows.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.620]   There is a world of difference between a thoughtfully
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.160]   and firmly and lovingly applied discipline
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.840]   of spanking after defiance,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.800]   but a slap-happy dad always seems to be swatting
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.220]   as his children.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.400]   Don't accompany your requirements of obedience
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.860]   with hitting the child.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.400]   Spankings are fitting and hopefully, carefully
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   and soberly and patiently and lovingly applied
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.680]   so that the child himself knows
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.960]   that the reason he's being disciplined is clear,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.880]   he knows what he's done
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.320]   and he deserves this measure of discipline,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.880]   but don't make slapping or swatting or blows
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   a normal accompaniment of your requirement of obedience.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.320]   Fifth, don't try to get obedience by embarrassing the child,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.080]   perhaps by asking him to do something in front of people
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.680]   that is so obvious he's gonna do it anyway.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.560]   Seek ways to make your commands respectful,
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.720]   showing that you expect intelligent obedience.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.400]   Sixth, don't require obedience by belittling your child.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.080]   For example, don't call him names.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.000]   Don't speak in a way that he feels contempt
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.840]   coming from his father.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.260]   Don't ask him to do something
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.200]   the way you would ask a three-year-old
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.360]   if he's a nine-year-old.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.840]   Seven, don't demand things that are impossible
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.240]   for the child to do at his age.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.360]   Don't set him up for automatic failure.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.320]   Don't say, "I want you back here in 30 seconds."
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.480]   When you know that's not even possible,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.220]   you're asking the child to fail, which is discouraging.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.060]   And eighth, perhaps most important,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.840]   but they're all important, I think,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.280]   but this is probably most important,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   don't try to get obedience without creating an atmosphere
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.820]   of gospel forgiveness.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.820]   So many dads and moms fail to teach a child early
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:19.280]   that Jesus has provided a way to get relief
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.080]   for their guilt after doing bad things,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.400]   a way to be forgiven.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.020]   Without this, the child doesn't know what to do
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.320]   with his own sins, which he knows he commits.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.000]   Every kid knows he does bad things.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.420]   So every command starts to feel like a potential digging
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.220]   of a deeper hole of guilt.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.220]   Without a pattern of confession and forgiveness,
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.400]   the child will probably become secretive and deceitful.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   So dad, you must speak the gospel, teach the gospel,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.040]   so that the child understands how the blood of Jesus
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.440]   gives forgiveness and life and relief.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.000]   And you must embody the gospel in your own confession
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.560]   of sin and your own offer of forgiveness.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.640]   So Matt, take heart.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   You have a heavenly father that has modeled all of this
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.400]   for you and toward you.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   And there is hope, therefore, that you can be a father
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.720]   with children who are both obedient and encouraged.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.680]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.600]   That's a great question, Matt.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.440]   We appreciate it, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.880]   You can ask a parenting question of your own like Matt did,
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.560]   or search our huge archive of over 1,800 episodes,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.400]   or subscribe to the podcast and get our latest releases.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   You can do all of that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.100]   Well, is it sinful to fall short of excellence in our work?
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.760]   This is a great question, relevant for businessmen,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.960]   for stay-at-home wives, for volunteers,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.480]   for students, for all of us.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.000]   And that's the question on the table Monday.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.200]   Is it sinful to fall short of excellence at work?
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.720]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke, and Pastor John and I
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.240]   will see you on Monday for that.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.280]   Have a great weekend.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.440]   (upbeat music)
