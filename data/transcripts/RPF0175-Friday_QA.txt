[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Toyota's Black Friday deals are too good for just one day.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.000]   So right now, every day is Black Friday at your Toyota dealer.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.640]   Hurry in and get a low APR or a great lease on our most popular models,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.600]   like the powerful Camry, sporty RAV4, tough Tacoma, rugged Tundra,
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800]   and even the RAV4 Prime with its astonishing range.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.600]   But don't wait.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.800]   Black Friday every day and Cyber Monday.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200]   We make it easy.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   Toyota.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.800]   Let's go places.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.200]   Step right up.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.900]   Step right up.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, have I got a deal for you.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.960]   Pull out your wallet.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.660]   You don't have to hand it over quite yet.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.600]   But I do want you to know that I have something special in store for you.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.640]   This thing that I am about to unveil for you
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.520]   is going to make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.160]   It'll make you rich, not only you, but also your entire family.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.600]   And it will not take any time at all.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.400]   [LAUGHS]
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.000]   Aren't you glad you don't have to listen to that crap from me all the time?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.800]   If you'd like to keep the show free of that kind of stuff,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.640]   please go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.160]   and help keep that off the show.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160]   Happy Friday, everybody.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.000]   Today it's Friday Q&A. And let's see.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420]   I've got, I think, three or four questions lined up for you.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.800]   We're going to have a quick conversation about the actual rate of return,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.600]   what actual support for what the value of financial advisor
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800]   can actually bring.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.360]   We're going to have a quick conversation about what's the fastest
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.080]   way to become a 1%-er.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.040]   We're going to talk about how on earth can you
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.840]   learn to trust insurance people.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.760]   And we're going to talk about the role of an IPO
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.320]   within a broader investment portfolio.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.800]   Here we go.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:02:02.960]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your overly effusive and overly
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.560]   ebullient host today.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.200]   I can't help it.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.160]   It's Friday.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   It's a beautiful Friday.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.760]   I like doing Q&A. And sometimes, you know,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.320]   I just got to have a little bit of fun.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.520]   And I hope you don't mind coming along for the ride.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.880]   On Fridays, I answer your show.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.160]   And today, these are all voicemail questions.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.840]   If you would like to get your question answered,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.400]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com and leave a message.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   But today, sit back, relax, and enjoy these answers.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.720]   I do love doing these shows.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.760]   And sometimes, I do emails.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.000]   And sometimes, I do voicemails.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.440]   I really like doing voicemails because it helps the audience
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.200]   to hear the questions.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.320]   And if you want a much higher probability that your question is
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.560]   going to be answered, leave a voicemail for me.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.040]   You can do that in one of two ways.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.240]   Either pull out your phone, hit the Voice Memo button on it,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.160]   record an MP3 file-- please make it about one or two minutes
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.800]   long--
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.080]   hit Email, and email that to me at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.760]   Or the other way that you can do it is go
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.560]   to radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.080]   And over on the side, you'll see a little button that says,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.480]   send us a voice message.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.800]   That'll work on your phone.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   It'll also work on your computer.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.080]   And you can record a voicemail message for me.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.440]   If you have a question that you'd like me to answer for you
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.080]   that you would prefer to email me,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.680]   you feel free to email it to me as a text file.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.760]   And from time to time, I will do those questions.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.920]   But I do give priority to the voicemails.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   And I get far more of those types of questions
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.320]   than I can get on the show.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.720]   And if you want to get special consideration,
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960]   just mark in there that you are a patron.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.320]   In fact, if you are a patron at the $5 a month level and up,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.360]   then you will, in fact, always get
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.640]   moved to the front of the line.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.800]   And at the moment, I will actually
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.760]   guarantee you that your question will be
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.200]   answered on the Friday shows.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.040]   I may not always be able to guarantee those.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   If we get a few thousand patrons at $5 a month, which
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.160]   is one of my goals over time, and if I
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.480]   get hundreds of questions, I won't always be able to get
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.280]   them to the front.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.440]   But for right now, I can pretty much
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.320]   guarantee if you want your question answered,
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.680]   just let me know you are a patron at the $5 a month
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.840]   level and up, and I will answer it.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.720]   So with that, let's get straight to it.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.560]   Our first question comes in from Rick.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.080]   Here we go, Rick.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.000]   Sorry, it's a little bit noisy.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.080]   This is Rick Komaric.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.560]   And in your last podcast, the Dole Roller episode interview,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.040]   Rob asked you if there was any academic study showing
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.280]   that an investor could do better with an advisor than by himself
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.360]   using index funds.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.600]   And yes, there is a study.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.960]   It was done by Morningstar.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.760]   And it showed that those who invest with DFA, which,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.520]   of course, all have advisors.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.640]   That's the only way to get those index funds,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.920]   earned 109% of the fund return.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   So they actually earned more money
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.480]   than the fund itself returned.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.160]   In addition to that, Vanguard just
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   released its paper called "Advisor's Alpha."
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.040]   In addition to that, we have Morningstar,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.920]   who issued the metrics of gamma, which
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   is measuring its advisor's contribution to an investor.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.920]   Hope that helps.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.160]   And I'll talk to you later.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.120]   And yes, I'm one of your Patreon members.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.960]   Take care.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.200]   So the reason that I wanted to make sure to play this for you
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.480]   is because I want to thank Rick publicly for sending me
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.720]   the paper regarding DFA's returns.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.080]   I was not familiar with this particular paper.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560]   I will link to all three of these papers
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.280]   in the show notes that he referenced-- the Morningstar
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.200]   discussion of dimensional fund advisors results,
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.080]   also Vanguard's paper on what value a financial advisor
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.720]   actually can bring, and then the Morningstar corporate paper
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.960]   on gamma.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.480]   What they're trending toward is calling
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.160]   what the value that an advisor can bring gamma.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.660]   I don't know why we always have to stick with Greek letters,
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.080]   but for whatever reason, that's the deal.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.640]   And in the financial comparison scenario,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.520]   the words alpha talks about who can find the best advisor, who
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.840]   can find the best stock picker, or mutual fund manager,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.360]   that type of thing.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.160]   Basically, it's outperformance from one manager to another.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.240]   Beta refers primarily to the asset allocation,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.160]   the overall returns of a market.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160]   And then they're using this little catch-all term gamma
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.840]   now.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.240]   And that's the term that is being
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.200]   applied to the results for an individual investor.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.600]   I should, at some point, do an entire show on this topic.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.200]   But I am glad to have the DFA Morningstar analysis
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.640]   that Rick mentioned to me.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.600]   Because what it illustrates is that the investors who
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.320]   were using dimensional fund advisors' funds did better.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.720]   And let me explain-- if you're unfamiliar with dimensional fund
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.100]   advisors, let me explain who they are and what they do.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.320]   Dimensional fund advisors is 100%
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.880]   committed to a passive indexing strategy.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.080]   So they pursue, just like Vanguard,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.680]   who is much larger and more well-known,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.880]   they only do passive investing, where they're not trying
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.760]   to specifically choose an active strategy.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.160]   We're not trying to say, we think that ExxonMobil
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.600]   is going to do better than this other oil company.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.000]   Or we think that Coca-Cola is going to do better than Pepsi.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.640]   They're not pursuing that type of individual selection
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.200]   in their mutual funds.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.080]   What they are pursuing is they are actually simply choosing
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.760]   and saying, we're going to own the whole market,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.360]   but with a couple of twists.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.960]   One of the things that they do is
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.320]   they don't try to always ride the indexes completely.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.960]   So when the S&P 500 adds a new firm or kicks one firm out
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.720]   and firms are replaced, if you're
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   running a normal index fund, you need
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.400]   to immediately update your mutual fund
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.680]   to match this change in the index.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   But the dimensional fund advisors, portfolio managers,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.080]   have a little bit more of a leeway with what they actually
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.240]   do, when they actually get in and out.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.960]   The big thing that, to me, is important about dimensional
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.680]   fund advisors is the only way that you're
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.640]   able to access dimensional fund advisors
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.360]   is through an individual financial advisor, to whom
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:31.000]   you are paying an additional fee for his or her purview
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.440]   over your accounts.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   Now, ultimately, obviously, this adds cost.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.080]   So clearly, they're not going to be as inexpensive
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   if you're layering advisor fees on top of mutual fund fees.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.240]   But there are some benefits in that arrangement
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.200]   that go in all directions.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.640]   There are benefits to the mutual fund company.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.440]   There are also benefits to the advisor.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.160]   And most importantly, there are benefits to the client.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.520]   Now, I'm not trying to do a DFA commercial here.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.840]   If you're interested, go and research their stuff.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.120]   They are perfectly capable of marketing their own services.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.360]   But the major aspect that I see as the benefit
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.800]   is that, with an advisor and a client working together,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.520]   the client should be able to make
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.400]   more intelligent, non-emotional decisions.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.960]   Emotions are the death of a good investment plan.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.680]   Almost any emotional reaction is going
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.320]   to be wrong in any scenario, whether it's on the upside
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.560]   or on the downside.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.920]   It's not to say that you can't move quickly.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.600]   But even those who are moving quickly,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.400]   it can't be based upon emotion.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.560]   There may be such a thing as a gut feeling, I guess.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.840]   In some scenarios, that's fine.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.280]   But that's not necessarily emotion.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.200]   But the problem is that we, as individual investors,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.320]   are pretty horribly equipped to actually handle
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.360]   the raw emotion of investing at some times,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.840]   especially in the world of stock investing,
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.080]   where any time of day or night, you can pull out your phone
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   and you can get an exact to the dollar calculation of what
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.880]   your shares are worth.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.600]   So there are many, many problems associated
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.040]   with the ability to actually know on a daily basis.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   But it makes us much more likely to overreact
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.840]   to good news and bad news and make improper decisions.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.680]   Well, my thought is, I believe that a good financial advisor,
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.200]   in addition to all of the aspects of financial planning,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.880]   that a good financial advisor should
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.920]   be able to bring some peace and calm to that situation,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.840]   should be able to be, in some ways, a shock absorber.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.400]   That's the best scenario I've come up with.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.160]   The shock absorber is what takes the impact of the road
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.440]   and cushions it for the individual who's in the car.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.860]   And that should be, in many ways,
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.240]   the role of a good financial advisor.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.960]   And then there are many techniques
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.040]   to doing that as a good, competent financial advisor.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.400]   It's techniques of warning in advance.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.800]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.400]   Training and coaching your clients
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.880]   to be comfortable with the emotion
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.240]   that they're going to face.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.440]   If you know you're going to face a certain emotion,
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.640]   if you know you're going to face a gut-wrenching fear,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   if you know you're going to face a euphoria that causes you
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.640]   to be tempted to do something that is probably not
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.800]   the best move, then if you're warned in advance,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.960]   perhaps you can avoid it.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.440]   Or you can think through how you're going to handle that.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.640]   A simple scenario would be a financial advisor
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.440]   should take a client through the scenario and say, OK, it's 2015.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.640]   There hasn't been a major stock market
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.120]   correction in quite a while.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   Let's talk through what that's going to feel like.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   Here is the balance of your account.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.960]   You have half a million dollars.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.600]   Let's talk through how you're going
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.320]   to feel if you pull out your phone
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.960]   and you're checking your account summary
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.480]   and you find out that you now have $285,000 in that.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.240]   How are you going to feel?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.480]   And smoke those feelings out in advance
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.440]   so you can make sure that the portfolio is positioned
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.000]   in such a way that we can get through that time.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.240]   And then as an advisor, you have to use whatever tactics
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.320]   and techniques you can use in an individual situation
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.400]   to improve that.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.080]   So maybe you need to adjust the asset
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.720]   allocation of the portfolio.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.760]   Maybe you need to have assets that are pulled out
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.880]   and just sitting in cash.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.160]   Maybe the client says, well, if I had $100,000 in cash
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   instead of $30,000 in cash, I'd feel a lot better.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.760]   Because I would know that I could
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.040]   get through a couple of years.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.200]   Because the advisor would say to the client and say,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.680]   well, listen, if you look over here
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.400]   and you're spending $50,000 a year,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.160]   you have $500,000 invested.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.200]   But in addition, you have $100,000 in cash.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   And you know that even though this account value dropped
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.800]   by that much, you're looking over here
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.600]   and you know that you've got two years of cash
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.560]   with no other change.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.600]   Are you going to feel better about my simply saying,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.160]   don't touch it, turn your phone off,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.400]   and don't check your account summary?
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.240]   And so those are the types of conversations
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.560]   that a client and an advisor should have.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.720]   So what was my point in this?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.760]   My point was to A, expose you to these articles,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.560]   because I think they're well-done articles.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.840]   And for many of you who are financial advisors,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.560]   I think this is a good resource for you
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.040]   to have in your back pocket.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.120]   If you haven't read Vanguard's discussion of the value
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.240]   that an alpha brings, an advisor brings,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.080]   it's an excellent job that Vanguard
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.960]   has done with that paper, and then also the corporate Morning
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.440]   Star paper.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.360]   All three of those will be linked in the show notes.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.320]   I'm going to answer another question for Rick
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.560]   without playing the question.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.240]   He asked and called and said, basically,
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.160]   what's the best way to study for and pass the CFP exam?
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.240]   He said back in years ago, I think it was 2007,
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.040]   he had taken the classes that were
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.600]   required to be prepared for it, but never sat for the CFP
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.120]   exam.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.840]   So Rick, quickly, and for anyone else who's interested,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.200]   the answer is you need a CFP refresher course.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.920]   The best one that I know of is the one
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.080]   that I went through, which was Ken Zahn's class.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.400]   And Ken Zahn is spelled Z-A-H-N. So go to--
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.360]   let's see, it would be KenZahn.com.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.120]   And he will send you--
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.320]   when you sign up for that class, he
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.560]   will send you a couple of books to prepare in advance.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.880]   Those are the books that he actually teaches from for his 6
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.920]   or 7, or whatever, 6, 7, 8 classes.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.680]   He actually uses those books as his textbooks
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.920]   that he teaches through.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.800]   Prior to the refresher course, you
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.440]   will need to study and read those books,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.360]   do all the practice questions.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.760]   Then you'll go to a four-day refresher course.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.240]   And that's a pretty intense scenario.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.560]   And he'll walk through a four-day review.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.240]   And then after that, you've got lots of practice exams.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.880]   Take the practice exams and then go sit for the test.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.720]   But I know there are others that do it.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.840]   I don't have any experience with any others than his class.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.800]   I liked his refresher course so much
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.520]   that I went through it twice.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.960]   I went through it once, and then I had a scheduling conflict
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   where I wasn't able to sit for the CFP exam as I had planned.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.440]   So I actually went through it twice.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.760]   And I learned a ton in that class and really enjoyed it.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.200]   So that's what I would do.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.160]   Ken is on one of those.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.360]   I need to reach out to him.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.280]   If I do ever take advertisers on the show
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.360]   or set up affiliate relationships or things
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.640]   like that to make more money on commissions,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.480]   he is one of those that's on my list of products and services
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.760]   that I just had a great experience from.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.920]   So KenZahn.com, check that out.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.840]   All right, next, let's take a question on becoming a 1%.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.480]   Great program.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.440]   Love it.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.160]   I had a quick question for you.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.440]   Maybe it's not a quick answer.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.600]   What's the fastest way you've seen to become a 1%-er?
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.240]   You see a lot of bashing and all the trashing of the 1%-ers.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.560]   But I'm just curious, from your experience,
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.040]   what's been the fastest way you've seen someone become one?
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.280]   You don't see much about that versus the, oh,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.040]   look at how evil they are.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.960]   So I'd be curious as your perspective of this.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.000]   Hopefully, I'd be really interested in your response
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.880]   and your experience.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.280]   Love the show, and keep it up.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.600]   Fun question.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.560]   Short answer.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   Well, how do I--
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.400]   I was going to say it was a two-word answer,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.680]   but I don't know how many words it is.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.560]   Facebook.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.720]   Start Facebook.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.240]   Or start Twitter.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.480]   Start something like that, or Instagram,
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.440]   or something like that.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.640]   In 2015, that certainly is the fastest way
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.720]   that I know of to make a massive--
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.160]   to go and become a 1%-er.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.640]   Just Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.560]   How long ago did he actually start Facebook?
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.520]   I think I got my Facebook account,
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.280]   it would have been 2005.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.480]   I remember where I was when I first signed up for Facebook.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.080]   I remember I was actually in a lobby of a hotel,
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.720]   a lounge of a hotel I would often go to when I was living
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.240]   in San Jose, Costa Rica.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   This is a place some friends and I like to go,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.600]   and I would take my laptop down, and I would work there
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   because they had Wi-Fi.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   And this was before Wi-Fi was widely prevalent
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.520]   in individual homes.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   So I had to go to the hotel lobby.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.600]   And I remember signing up for my Facebook account,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.720]   and there were my 55 friends from high school.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.600]   But compare that to where it's grown to be today, to be 2015.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.560]   That is the fastest way that I can think of.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.920]   Now, it's also the most riskiest way.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.400]   You've got some pretty heavy, stiff competition.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.240]   And so you've got to balance that.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.520]   What is the likelihood of your inventing the next app that
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.760]   goes from $0--
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.000]   the next Instagram that goes from $0 of value to huge value?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   It's pretty low.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.880]   But it's probably the fastest way
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.000]   I know to go from $0 to a billion dollars.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.760]   So that's my quick answer.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.880]   Probably the more important question
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.480]   that I would demonstrate out of it,
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.280]   though, is that the speed is purely due to--
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.720]   well, if we're talking about wealth,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.320]   let's talk about actual wealth retained.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.600]   So the only thing that's going to impact the wealth
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.320]   that you make is the first four parts of my five-part path
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.560]   to wealth, or what you can actually do,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.160]   your plan for wealth.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.240]   The first thing is, how much is your income?
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   Number two is, how much are your expenses?
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.360]   And number three is, what rate of return
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.360]   do you gain on the difference?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.840]   And then can you avoid catastrophe?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.240]   Those are the ones that are going to apply to the speed.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.960]   So if you want to go from nothing to a 1-percenter,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.200]   you need to amp up all of those things massively.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.760]   You need to earn a very high level of income.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.200]   You need to have a proportionately very low level
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.000]   of expenses.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And you need to earn massive rates of return
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.040]   on the difference.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.880]   Now, what is it that the tech people do?
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.040]   What's the theme that goes through that?
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.760]   Well, what they do is they are earning
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.280]   a massive rate of return.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.880]   A good general rule of thumb is that the highest rates of return
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.960]   are always going to come from business.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.840]   Business, private enterprise, that's where you create money.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.760]   So if you can create money, you can
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.640]   earn a higher rate of return.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.320]   The highest rates of return, potential rates of return
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.280]   from businesses, are going to come
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.400]   from businesses that can exponentially
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.320]   increase their reach.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.560]   So if you and I start a garbage company,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.640]   we've got to invest in a massive number of garbage trucks.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.320]   We've got to hire a bunch of employees.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.000]   We've got to start getting contracts.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.440]   And let's assume that we just need to, one to one to one
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.680]   to one, go and sell and get contracts
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.240]   with various municipalities to start a garbage business.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.040]   That business can grow, and it can scale.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.880]   And it can scale much more quickly than, say,
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.760]   me working in my backyard making handmade bird feeders
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.440]   and selling them out of my driveway.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.840]   But it's nowhere near the scalability of something
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.600]   like Instagram, an app that can be created once and put out
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.000]   there, and then the number of users
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.400]   can go from zero to massive overnight.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.360]   So the reason why the tech companies grow so fast
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.760]   is because they don't have the constraints on their growth
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.640]   that many other businesses have.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.920]   They're able to just simply generate massive rates of return
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.200]   as measured by their user base.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.560]   And then once they have a massive rate of return
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.240]   from their user base, then that creates
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.160]   money, that creates value that can be sold,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.720]   either through an IPO or through a takeover, a private sale,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   something like that.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.000]   That's why they grow so well.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.160]   So speed in that situation is going
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.880]   to be driven by the fact that they can expand.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.120]   They can compound, because they're not
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.680]   subject to the constraints of real life.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.440]   They're a purely digital product,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.960]   a purely digital medium.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.480]   That's exactly the same thing that what
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.400]   I'm trying to do with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.160]   One of my motivations, why did I go
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.600]   from working face to face with individual clients
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.160]   to creating a podcast?
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.960]   Well, I looked at it and I said, I want to grow wealth quickly.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.200]   And I believe that I can grow wealth steadily and slowly
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.240]   face to face with clients.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.120]   But I can grow wealth far more quickly
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.360]   if I can get my content into the digital medium.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.960]   Because in this type of scenario,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.160]   it doesn't matter whether--
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.240]   it's no extra cost to me whether 100,000 people download
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.080]   my show or whether 100 people download my show.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.960]   It costs me exactly the same amount of money.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.800]   But the flip side, as I build out additional business models,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.480]   the flip side is that my income can grow exponentially.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.080]   Now, originally, it was going to be the show and my practice.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.040]   Then I could harvest the best of both worlds.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, unfortunately, the financial services business
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.800]   is stuck in 1937.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.520]   And so we can't allow any kind of interesting--
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   so I had to walk away from any kind of interesting advertising.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.600]   So I walked away from the financial services business.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.600]   But this is what I am taking advantage of,
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.080]   the fact that my show is able to now, in a digitized form,
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.360]   it's able to get into a scenario where
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.000]   it can grow at a compounded rate over time.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.400]   That's what I'm taking advantage of.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.520]   Now, as far as applying it to your actual life--
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.080]   so if you actually want to go from 0% to the 1%,
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.200]   you've got to say, well, what's appropriate for me?
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.440]   So I don't have any skill with coding applications.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.920]   Unless I have a brilliant business idea or a brilliant
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.120]   app idea and I can hire the actual coding work done,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.560]   which is doable, I don't have any skill with that.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.200]   So what I'm going to do is-- if I
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.360]   were going to do this with looking at business,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.440]   I would look and say, where do I see a need in the marketplace?
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.360]   And then you just go and try to fill that need.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.720]   And if possible, I would personally
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.040]   want to go and look at an industry that's out of favor,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.480]   that's unpopular, that's dirty, or that's not
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.240]   sexy or glamorous in any way.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.040]   And I would try to find a place where my competition is
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.120]   relatively low.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.600]   As much as possible, I would try to build an infrastructure
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:58.680]   onto this that would allow me to actually profit from something
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.360]   that can compound.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.160]   And I would try to serve an industry in a way
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.680]   that other people aren't serving.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.800]   Let me give you an example.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.920]   It's still related to tech.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.760]   But one of my brothers is actually a web programmer.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.680]   And he works in an industry where they service home health
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.880]   care providers.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.080]   Now, what this company that he is involved with has done
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.720]   is they have created software that
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   works within this one specific industry.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.480]   And they grew it from nothing to the best software
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.680]   in the industry in a relatively short amount of time.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.120]   But that's not the large, massive, mass competition
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.880]   space.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.480]   But they're still taking advantage of the same trend.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.360]   So if you can create and figure out
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.200]   what's a business that I can serve that's--
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.880]   I mean, there's nothing-- what is
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.640]   sexy about the home services, the home health care industry?
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   There's nothing particularly attractive to that.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.140]   Very few college students are saying, well, when I get out,
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.520]   I'm going to go and work in the home health care industry.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.480]   Well, that's the type of industry
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.000]   that I would go and look for.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.320]   It's like law and medicine and politics,
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.680]   I don't want to be around there.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.800]   Because where do you have to deal with?
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.100]   You have to deal with all the smartest people in the world
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.300]   who are all going into there.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.520]   So your level of competition is much higher.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.840]   I don't want to go into law.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.520]   All the lawyers are brilliant people.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.160]   And they all work super hard.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.520]   And now my competition is this much different caliber
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   of person.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.800]   I want to go to where the industry is that nobody
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.960]   else wants to touch.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.080]   The best example in my personal life was--
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.040]   one of my backup business ideas is
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.440]   to start a daycare, a daycare or a school.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.000]   You say, what kind of 30-year-old guy
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.400]   wants to go and start a daycare for kids?
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.600]   This one.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.680]   Because the competition, I think, is much lower.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.440]   That is not a very prestigious type of industry
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   to set yourself apart in.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.960]   That's not the kind of thing that most people aspire to.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.280]   But it can be very profitable.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.480]   And I know of a number of other industries
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.440]   like that where you can go and you can find
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.800]   something that's profitable.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.480]   Now, once you're in an industry that you
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.800]   feel like you have a competitive advantage into,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.120]   if you're going to go, you need to create some ability
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.040]   to where you can compound your efforts.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.680]   So let me give you an example.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.320]   Franchising.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.720]   Look at franchising.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.280]   Look at the difference that it makes
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.000]   between one guy in a truck going and hauling junk versus one guy
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.360]   saying, here's a business idea.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.800]   Maybe I can teach other people to do that.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.520]   And so the money, the big growths
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.520]   are always when you can get leverage on your time.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.560]   When instead of going and being two guys hauling junk,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.720]   or instead of going and-- what is the ones?
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.760]   1-800-GOT-JUNK or College Hunks Hauling Junk.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.440]   Instead of being the guy out driving the truck
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.680]   and hauling the junk, you figure out the business model.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.360]   You crack the business model.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.200]   And then you sell the franchise rights.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.120]   You sell something that's not connected to you.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.720]   So that's where you get the much higher rate of return.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.440]   Now, the flip side might be, let's
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.360]   say that you have the potential for a high earning capacity.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.240]   There's no reason why you have to go and make
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.840]   a fortune in private business.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.080]   You can also do it just simply with earning capacity.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.120]   So maybe you're running a company
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.000]   and you're a well-paid CEO or upper level management.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Well-paid CEO-- what do these guys make?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.040]   I mean, the CEO of Home Depot or Walmart, $30, $40, $50 million
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.280]   bucks a year.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.680]   I don't know anything specific.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.640]   But they make tens of millions of dollars per year.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.400]   It's hard not to get into the 1% if you
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.520]   can make tens of millions of dollars per year.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.580]   Or being a highly paid professional.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.080]   You're a very accomplished neurosurgeon.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   So you command with your surgery ability.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.840]   You can command millions of dollars
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.160]   per year of compensation.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.080]   If you've got that skill, or if you're
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.520]   willing to go down that path, that can work just as well.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.280]   Or you could be the business person behind the scenes.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.080]   So any of these things work.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.280]   The point is that it's all a function of those three things.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.240]   Just this morning in our private irregulars Facebook group,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.520]   one of the things that the patrons of the show who
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.120]   are at the irregulars level, which used to be $10 a month,
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.720]   is now $25 a month.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.880]   One of the major benefits of that level of patronage
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.800]   is access to a private Facebook group.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.640]   And that's where I try to spend most of my time interacting
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.160]   with the listeners.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.640]   Shared this article this morning.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.280]   And it's called "Root to an $8 million
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.920]   portfolio started with frugal living."
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.240]   And I'll just read a few paragraphs from it here,
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.640]   because it's going to emphasize my point.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.920]   "Ronald Reed may have spent years pumping gas,
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.280]   but he was even more adept at pumping up his portfolio.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.160]   Mr. Reed, a longtime resident of Brattleboro, Vermont,
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.600]   died in June at the age of 92.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.920]   His friends were shocked when they learned his estate was
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.240]   valued at almost $8 million.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.480]   Long widowed and with two stepchildren,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.080]   he left most of his money to a local hospital and library."
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.920]   So how did he manage to pull it off?
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.560]   "Besides being a good stock picker,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.120]   he displayed remarkable frugality and patience,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.160]   which gave him many years of compounded growth.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   He lived modestly, worked as a maintenance worker and janitor
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.560]   at a JCPenney store after a long stint at a service station that
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   was owned in part by his brother.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.360]   Those who knew him talk of how he at times used safety pins
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.800]   to hold his coat together, and sometimes parked
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.600]   his 2007 Toyota Yaris far from where
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   he was going to avoid having to feed the parking meter.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   Quote, 'If he could save a penny, he would,'
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.360]   says Bridgette Boakum, a senior client
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.520]   associate at the Wells Fargo Advisors Office in Brattleboro,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.560]   who was assisting with his estate.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.040]   When he died, Mr. Reed left behind a five inch
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.760]   thick stack of stock certificates
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.440]   in a safe deposit box.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.600]   The shares represented the bulk of his estate,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.560]   and his executor and Wells Fargo still
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.840]   are working to determine their exact worth.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.800]   Mr. Reed owned at least 95 stocks
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.440]   at the time of his death, many of which
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.880]   he had held for years, if not decades.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   They were spread across a variety of sectors,
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.120]   including railroads, utility companies, banks, health care,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.040]   telecom, and consumer products.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.080]   He avoided technology stocks.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.440]   Friends say Mr. Reed typically bought shares of company
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.200]   he was familiar with, and those that paid out hefty dividends.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.740]   When dividend checks came in the mail,
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.200]   he plowed the money back into more shares, Ms. Boakum says.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   He goes on and talks about what he actually did.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.240]   Now, my point here is here's a guy
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.440]   who works at a service station and as a janitor,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.160]   and he dies at the age of 92 with an estate valued
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.800]   at $8 million.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.040]   Now, of course, many people listen to that and say,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.560]   what a waste.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.760]   He could have spent the money.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.360]   Ignore that.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.440]   Just focus on the point that he was wealthy.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.560]   How did he-- he's in the top 1%.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.880]   How did he become in the top 1%?
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.440]   It wasn't necessarily through his income.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.480]   It was through a little bit of his income,
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.520]   coupled with his frugality, and strong investment performance.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.000]   He invested in stocks instead of bonds or CDs,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.840]   so he took advantage of the growth potential of businesses,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.160]   which led to a much higher rate of return over time,
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.680]   and he had a long time period.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.400]   That's the function of wealth.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.760]   So you've got to look at your own situation,
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.120]   and you've got to see what are my advantages.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.800]   If you don't have the ability to go--
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.360]   I'm not a neurosurgeon.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.840]   I'm not an attorney, so I'm not going to go out there
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.040]   and start working as a trial attorney making $5 million
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.600]   a year.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   So for me, I'm drawn to business,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.560]   and I would say, let me give me a business
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.760]   and let me figure out how to grow this business,
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.080]   and I'll just apply my sweat equity to it and make it grow.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.360]   That's my skill.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.720]   But another person may not be.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.680]   There are lots of 1% attorneys.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.400]   There are lots of 1% physicians.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.120]   So the point is, look at your situation
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.840]   and recognize what your advantages are.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.400]   The higher the income, the better.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.080]   The lower the expenses, the better.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.960]   And the higher the rate of return, the better.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.640]   There's nothing else you can do.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.000]   There's nothing else you can do.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.600]   You do have to avoid catastrophe along the way,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.400]   but there's nothing else you can do.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.240]   So what that means, you get a multimillion dollar contract
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.080]   playing basketball.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.640]   For some people, that's the path to the 1%.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.240]   And for others, it's working as a janitor.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.160]   Those are the only things you control, though.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.120]   So getting into the 1% is just simply a transition
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.560]   of getting through that.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.480]   And if you mess up any of those things,
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.600]   if you're on a low income--
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.120]   trying to think of how many-- if you have a low income,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.640]   but you invest very wisely, and your expenses are low,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.760]   you can get wealthy.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.720]   If you have a low income, but your expenses are
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.320]   high or equal to your income, you
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.800]   don't have any money to invest.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.380]   And so you're not going to be wealthy.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.280]   If you have a low income and low expenses,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.800]   but you don't invest well, then you're not going to be wealthy.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.320]   So you've got to do each of those things right.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.680]   Now, if you have a high income and you have high expenses,
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.360]   you're not going to be wealthy.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.680]   And there's a massive percentage of NFL players
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.440]   that, after they are retired from the NFL,
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.560]   after making millions for some of them,
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.640]   they're broke and bankrupt.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.480]   Why?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.240]   Well, you can spend millions just as-- not as easily,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.900]   but you can spend millions pretty easily
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.680]   if you develop a certain lifestyle.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.920]   So a high income is not a guarantee of wealth.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.000]   But a high income, coupled with frugality,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.680]   coupled with great investment returns,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.200]   will lead to potentially massive wealth.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.760]   And that's why, when you start looking
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.680]   at some of the athletes that you can look at--
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.080]   I mean, look at Shaquille O'Neal.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.920]   The dude has more money than--
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   I mean, he's done very well for himself.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.000]   It's awesome.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.660]   What has he done?
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.960]   He's invested wisely.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.760]   And you can go and research them at some--
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.240]   I don't remember all the names, but you can go and research.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   I mean, you find this guy has 60 restaurant locations of this
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.840]   and another.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.800]   I mean, you can build your wealth.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.200]   So a high income is going to be great.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.960]   And so the best, fastest results are
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.920]   going to be with the highest income possible,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.440]   the lowest expenses possible, and the very highest
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.240]   investment returns.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.240]   And you've got to figure out, in your situation,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.040]   how to achieve that.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.800]   So hopefully that helps a little bit.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.120]   It did make me think of--
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.560]   and I went and looked it up.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.120]   Joshua Kennan wrote an excellent article--
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.560]   it was a few years ago--
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.920]   and I went and found it.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.080]   And I guess it's called, "How Much Money Does It
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.640]   Take to Be in the Top 1% of Wealth and Net Worth
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.840]   in the United States?"
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.960]   It's an excellent article.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.240]   I will post it here in the show notes for today's show.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.360]   So you can go and read that.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.600]   It'll give you something else to look at as far as even
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.440]   how to measure the 1%.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.240]   The stats that are thrown around are really not well done.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   Well, what else is new when you pay attention to the media?
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.680]   But my point is, he actually goes through and tries
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.080]   to figure out how to do it.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.320]   Here's my last-- how to calculate
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.200]   what the numbers are.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.440]   He does a good job with it.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.720]   Here's my last thing that I want to mention on this subject.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   Getting in the 1%, I think, is probably not
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.120]   a great financial goal.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.360]   I mean, I hesitate to say it's stupid,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.520]   but I'm pretty strongly there.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.960]   What does it matter to get into the 1%?
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.000]   Do you think-- and if you do get into the 1%,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.640]   I think it's more accidental than not.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.400]   Did Mark Zuckerberg plan to get into the top 1%?
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.800]   Did Bill Gates plan to get into the top 1%?
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.320]   These things can happen.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   And yes, good decisions can get you closer.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.120]   But to me, I think it's a vanishingly difficult goal.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.960]   And if that's your goal, you're likely to spend your life
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.080]   and waste it on a useless goal.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.440]   Ronald Reed is dead.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.160]   And all his money went to a library and to a hospital.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.480]   My hat's off to him.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.000]   And I am glad that he is able to send the money to where
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.680]   he thinks it's valued.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.800]   I really do respect that.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.920]   But I look at that, and I say, what a waste.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.680]   What a waste to send all your money to a library,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.960]   to a hospital, in a world where the libraries around me--
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.500]   I don't know what they are about you,
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.400]   but the libraries around me are massive.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.280]   They're incredibly fancy.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.200]   And they're empty.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:00.360]   Now, maybe that trend will change.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.640]   I like to use my fancy library.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.160]   But man, that seems like a total waste of money to me
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.920]   to put money into that.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.860]   And hospitals, I don't want to put money
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.400]   into the hospital system the way it is right now.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.360]   It's a disaster.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.800]   So that's probably a little bit uncharitable of me.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.200]   Because on the one hand, if that was his goal,
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.480]   and that was what he wanted to accomplish,
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.640]   I mean, I applaud the man for following through.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.440]   And it's his money.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.400]   It wasn't my money.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.640]   So in many ways, I have no right to say anything.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.240]   But I look at that, and I say, what a waste.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   Not a waste of a life.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.440]   If he was surrounded by people that loved him,
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.960]   if he was able to do good in a way that made an impact,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.680]   then awesome.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   I'm not saying it's a waste of a life.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.920]   And I admire his frugality.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.680]   But I look at it and say, how much better to actually,
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.560]   instead of accumulating all that wealth,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.240]   to actually put your life into something
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.920]   that you can make a difference in?
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.680]   The problem with making money a goal is money is stolen.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   It's swindled, another way for stolen.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.960]   It's taxed.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.280]   It's a very poor goal.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.520]   But yet the other things that people mainly want
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.800]   can be achieved without money.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.280]   So I think wealth should be a natural byproduct
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.840]   of a life well lived.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.800]   But I think it's a better byproduct than it is a goal.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.920]   If you develop the character of a man like Mr. Reed,
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.560]   the habits of a man like Mr. Reed, then it's natural,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.000]   I think, that you will wind up wealthy.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.200]   And then you'll be faced with the burden of saying,
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.880]   what do I do with all this money?
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.480]   And was that a good use of my life?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.640]   I personally-- and again, I hope--
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.440]   I'm not being uncharitable toward Mr. Reed.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.080]   I just heard of this story this morning.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.240]   My only point is I hope he left behind a much greater legacy
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.800]   than just the money.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   Because the man's dead.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.680]   And that money will be spent quickly by the organizations
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   that he left it to.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.480]   Again, the libraries around me are not lacking for funding.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.840]   They have the fanciest buildings.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.120]   They have the fanciest new carpet.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.680]   And they are empty.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.960]   And the hospitals around me are not lacking for funding,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.320]   either.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.480]   So that money is a drop in the bucket
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.680]   in their operating budgets.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.080]   But it's everything in his life.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.280]   I just hope it wasn't everything in his life.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.160]   And I'm sure it wasn't.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.080]   He sounds like the kind of guy I'd love to have on the show.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.120]   So don't take my comments as being uncharitable.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:44.080]   Just my point is, being in the 1% is not a goal.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.560]   Build the life that you want somebody
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.800]   to eulogize at your funeral.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.340]   And if money is a byproduct of that, great.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.400]   And if money is not a byproduct of that, great.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.280]   But build the life that you want somebody
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.200]   to eulogize at your funeral.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.800]   So I hope that helps.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.960]   Let's go to Brian.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.120]   Hi, Josh.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.000]   My name is Brian.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.320]   And I'm calling because I really enjoyed your show
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.800]   since I found it a month or so ago.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.560]   By the way, Brian was very complimentary.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   He also gave a bunch of details.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.160]   And what I'm going to do is I'm going to skip forward here
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.580]   to get to his questions, I guess.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.240]   I think we're in pretty fair shape when
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.400]   it comes to saving, both short and long term,
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.160]   living within our means, and making sound decisions
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.960]   with our income and investments.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.200]   My big problem really comes to my confidence level
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.600]   in insurance and in insurance salesmen.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.360]   I have basic car health insurance, renter's insurance,
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.080]   but have very little confidence that they'll actually
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.560]   be there to help in a time of need
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.000]   and really assume that the insurance companies will
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   find a loophole to deny claims if they need to.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.080]   So I'm calling to ask you to please help me get over
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.400]   this great distrust of insurance.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.480]   These are very important financial planning instruments.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   I know that they're vital to any family
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.000]   and sound financial planning.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.200]   So any recommendations that you have or conversation
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.600]   you can have about this, I'd really appreciate.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.520]   Thanks a lot, and we'll talk to you.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.680]   Brian, it's a great question.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.880]   And I'm not going to talk you out of your distrust
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.720]   of insurance people.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.160]   I don't trust a lot of people.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.040]   And I don't think that skepticism or cynicism
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.360]   is particularly a bad thing.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.920]   I will talk about the insurance industry and what I've learned.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.760]   But to me, what's the old joke about paranoia?
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.600]   Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.760]   they're not out to get you.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.560]   The financial world, in fact, the world
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.480]   is rife with problems.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.840]   What happens, especially in the United States of America,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.600]   we have become very complacent with the idea
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.560]   that there's always a fallback position.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.280]   Think about how conveniently and easily you'll swipe
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.000]   your credit card everywhere.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.760]   Well, the reason you'll do that is because your credit card
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.280]   company wants you to have that confidence in them.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.600]   So that's why you have all the fraud prevention stuff.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.400]   That's why you can dispute the charges
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400]   and all of those things.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.320]   They've got to create that trust.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.440]   So that's not-- but you've got to be careful,
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.560]   because the world is not necessarily
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.200]   full of people who are all moral and upright,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.120]   always willing to do the right thing.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.960]   Depending on where you are and who you're dealing with,
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.200]   you've got to be careful.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.600]   You're the steward of the resources that you have,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.960]   and you've got to make sure that you are caring for them
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.720]   properly.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.960]   Now, with regard to insurance, well, I
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.440]   think it's good to be suspicious.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.840]   I think it's important to do your research carefully.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.600]   I think you should research your insurance agent.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.240]   I think you should research your insurance company.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.040]   I think you should read your insurance contracts.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:23.640]   So I think these are important things to do.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.240]   My wife is an amazing, wonderful woman.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.600]   And one of the things that I love about her
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.440]   is she will not sign anything until she
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.640]   has read the entire thing.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.640]   And when we close on our house--
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.000]   so I'm almost as uptight as she is, but not quite.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.960]   But she is much more particular than I am,
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.120]   and she's less subject to peer pressure than I am.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.720]   I'm the kind of guy, I'm much more easily pushed over
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.920]   and rushed or hastened, things like that.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.560]   Just sign, Josh.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.440]   OK, OK.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.840]   I'm much more likely to give into that.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.680]   She won't give into that at all.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.560]   So when we close on our house, I specifically
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.320]   told the real estate attorney who handled the closing,
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.640]   I said, if you want us to sign anything, either A,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.000]   be ready to sit there and wait, or B, send it to us in advance
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.240]   so we can have read it in advance.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.040]   And so we did.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.240]   We sat there, and we read.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.360]   They didn't send it to us in advance, so we sat there.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.440]   And I read every page, and she read every page.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.200]   And then we signed, and we asked questions, and we signed,
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.440]   and we asked questions.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.480]   Well, let me tell you how many people in the years
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   that I worked as a life insurance agent--
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.980]   let me tell you how many people actually read their insurance
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.200]   contracts.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.840]   About one.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.480]   I can't remember who it was, but I think one person I actually
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.280]   worked with was detailed enough that actually went and read
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.200]   the insurance contract.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.280]   Actually, I do know who it was--
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.840]   a guy who was a real estate investor.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.200]   And he actually read his insurance contracts.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.400]   Now, in the insurance business, with life insurance,
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.320]   disability insurance, long-term care insurance,
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.360]   that kind of thing, whenever you deliver an insurance contract,
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.840]   depending on the laws of your state,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.920]   there's a certain period of time in which you have
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.640]   what's called a free look.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.160]   And in that free look, in Florida, it's two weeks.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.840]   You could read the contract, and any time
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.280]   in the first two weeks of owning it,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.920]   you can return the contract, and you're
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.080]   entitled to a full refund of your money
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.400]   without any costs or expenses associated with it.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.360]   There's no risk to it.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.600]   So that's the point, is you're supposed
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.720]   to have time to sit there and read the contract.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.000]   But nobody does.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.480]   But you should.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.960]   So what I always tried to do was I actually
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.320]   tried to walk people through their contracts.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.280]   Once I realized that people didn't read them, I said,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   listen, most people don't ever read this.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.960]   Let me show you a few things that are important in here.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.060]   Now, obviously, that can be done in a way
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.600]   to disguise pertinent facts.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.080]   Let me point to paragraph B, section 2,
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.360]   when actually the section where the gotcha is
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.520]   is paragraph A, section 4.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.200]   But I used it as just a point, like, look, notice this,
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.120]   notice this, notice this, notice this.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.960]   And insurance contracts are actually
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.120]   pretty usually well-written.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.880]   They're nothing like reading a prospectus.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.520]   Prospectuses are hard to get through.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.920]   But insurance contracts are not that tough to get through.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.960]   Just sit down and read it.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.160]   But you know what's even a more damning statistic?
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.080]   It is not how many clients read insurance contracts,
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.360]   but actually how few agents read their insurance contracts.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.560]   It's horrible.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.280]   Or how few people read their prospectuses
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.600]   for their investments.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.840]   Or how few people read their annual reports.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.800]   We don't do it.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.280]   So I think you should be distrustful.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.480]   I think you should be careful.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.040]   And I think you should read the fine print carefully.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.520]   In today's modern world, when people get snookered,
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.000]   if you go back and you actually read the contract,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   it was written in there.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.160]   They just didn't understand it.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.960]   So don't sign anything that you don't understand.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.880]   Now, as far as people, there's often this reputation,
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.480]   I think, especially with insurance.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.200]   There's a reputation that insurance people have of perhaps
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.760]   not being so trusted.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   If you don't trust your insurance agent, get a new one.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.160]   My experience has been that many of the agents
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.600]   and financial advisors that I've known personally
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.960]   are mostly intending to do the right thing.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   But the business can start to wear on you over time.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.440]   You can start to get frustrated with how little people know
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.720]   and how little they question, how little valued
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.160]   you can tend to be.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.080]   That can be a real scenario.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.920]   If you're working with somebody and you value them,
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.120]   let them know.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.320]   Because what happens if you only hear from the people that
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.600]   don't value what you're doing or you only hear from the people
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.520]   that are unhappy, that's tough.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.880]   So let the people that you know know.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   The biggest thing that I would say
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.000]   that would help you to be well-protected when dealing
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.240]   with insurance people or investment people
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.120]   or frankly, anybody is ask questions.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.000]   One thing I have noticed, and this is primarily
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.760]   anecdotal from my experience, but I have observed it also
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.200]   in reading about other people's stories,
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.680]   is it seems like wealthy people are just
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.560]   willing to ask more questions and ask better questions
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.520]   and aren't scared of asking dumb questions.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.720]   If you don't understand something, ask about it.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   If you are dealing with a debate of what kind of home insurance
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.520]   should I get, just ask the agent and ask
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.160]   lots and lots of questions.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.600]   And if you get somebody who's not
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.160]   willing to answer your questions and doesn't simply say,
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.280]   I don't know the answer to that, but let me write it down,
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.960]   let me go get you an answer, then find a new agent.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.080]   That will protect you from the majority of problems
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.640]   that you'll face.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.480]   If people ask questions, I think they would actually do better.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.720]   It's like this.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.280]   I don't trust insurance companies.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.720]   I think you should verify and then trust and then verify
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.880]   and then keep verifying and keep verifying.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.800]   Companies should be working to earn and keep your business.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.280]   But look at the population that we live in.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.840]   When's the last time that anybody around you actually
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.120]   questioned our government on something?
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.660]   The United States of America and most
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.600]   of the major Western economies, Western countries
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.400]   where people are listening to this show,
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.960]   the United States of America is utterly bankrupt.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.840]   We owe over $200 trillion of total debt,
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.920]   about $18 trillion of direct debt
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.520]   and the balance of that unfunded liabilities to Medicare,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.920]   Medicaid, and Social Security.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.080]   It will never be paid.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.200]   But yet, when's the last time somebody actually questioned
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.520]   the people who are running our money and asked, wait a second,
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.280]   what are you doing?
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.080]   The problems that the US government faces
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.420]   are not the problems of the government.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.560]   It's our problems because we don't hold people accountable.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.840]   If we fix our own houses, then maybe theoretically
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:54.280]   at some point our corporate houses might be fixed.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.520]   I'm not going into a political rant here,
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.560]   but let me wrap up with just this.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.920]   Don't worry about trusting.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.060]   Research and verify and read and question
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.140]   and then make sure the companies that you're doing
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.300]   are doing business with you.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.640]   The final comment that I would make in addition to those
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.840]   things is, be careful with the companies
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.920]   that you do business with.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.040]   And be careful as far as how long of a leash
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.600]   that you give them.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.480]   I'll give you a simple example.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.600]   I have Comcast Internet.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.480]   Comcast is probably the worst company
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.880]   I've ever dealt with in my life from a business perspective.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.400]   If I could fire them and still get internet today,
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.880]   I would fire them in an instant.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.180]   It is horrendous.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.880]   It has been an absolutely horrible experience.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.440]   Unfortunately, in my area, they're pretty much it.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.680]   And they keep on sewing up their little monopoly,
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:56.160]   freezing out the competition, integrating with Time Warner.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.200]   It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.400]   And the United States keeps falling behind and behind
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.800]   and behind in terms of the quality of the service.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.360]   And every time a company comes in and says, OK,
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.840]   we're going to fix something and do a little bit better,
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.280]   then what happens?
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.360]   Well, Comcast sends their lobbyists up.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.400]   And they're all the same, all the big ones are the same.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.000]   I don't trust Comcast a bit.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.960]   Not a bit.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.560]   But I still have to use them.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.920]   But I keep them on a short rope.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.880]   And so if I got in a situation where
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.640]   I were dealing with a bill, I know I got to move quickly.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.040]   Because I don't trust them.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.360]   They're thieves, crooks and thieves.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.560]   Now, there are other companies that I've worked with.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.400]   I'll give an example.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.200]   I've done banking for years with USAA.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.760]   USAA has treated me amazingly well.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.840]   USAA holds my car insurance.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.720]   They have done a tremendous job.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.040]   They've earned my trust.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.800]   Still going to verify.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.280]   But they've earned my trust to where I'm much more comfortable
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.960]   with them from years of dealing with them,
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.240]   that they have a culture in which they actually
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.960]   care about me.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.040]   Part of that goes to the ownership structure
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.680]   of the company.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.080]   It's a mutual insurance company.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.720]   It's not a stock insurance company.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.280]   So I feel much more confident with them.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.480]   Now, USAA won't write my homeowner's insurance.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.400]   I don't trust my homeowner's company a bit.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.920]   But I still have to have it, and that's
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.080]   about the best I can get.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:18.760]   What's my point?
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.120]   My point is simply, understand who you're doing
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.000]   and cover yourself.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.760]   Read your contracts from cover to cover.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.600]   If you've never read your insurance contracts,
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.440]   get every one of them out and make it a project.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.720]   I'm going to read my homeownership policy.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.080]   I'm going to read my car insurance policy.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.480]   I'm going to understand the terms.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.040]   And if you don't understand, stand up for yourself.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.800]   Ask the agent.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.840]   Explain this word to me.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.280]   Read your investment statements.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.440]   I used to hate it.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.320]   When I was handling investment accounts,
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.600]   we would do sometimes account opening statements
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.120]   that were 200 pages.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.000]   200 pages.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.680]   Zero people ever read those 200 pages.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.040]   But you know what?
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.360]   Nobody ever cared.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   The clients trusted me.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.720]   And thankfully, I had looked--
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.440]   I hadn't read all 200 pages, every one,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.920]   but I'd looked carefully through it.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.240]   I knew there wasn't anything there that was screwing them.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.000]   I carefully pointed out the parts where
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.920]   they needed to be aware of them.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.040]   And so the clients trusted me.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.400]   And that was what happens.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.920]   But the problem is we've gotten so numb to it
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.640]   that we just sign stacks of stuff without reading it.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.320]   If every one of you listening, and I as well,
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.360]   if you sat there and said, OK, Mr. Investment Advisor,
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.480]   you're going to put this 200-page document in front
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.000]   of me.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   Well, I'm going to sit here right in your office,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.880]   and I'm going to read it.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.360]   All of a sudden, maybe the advisors
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.440]   would start pushing back.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.000]   And they would call up the attorneys.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.440]   And the attorneys would say, well,
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.640]   we've got to change something.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.920]   And we might actually get to some reasonable contracts.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.440]   Unfortunately, nobody does that, because we're all conditioned
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.600]   to simply sign stacks of paper.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.560]   Research the company and choose the person carefully.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.160]   Ask lots of good questions.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.640]   And caveat emptor.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.280]   It's your money.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.680]   You're responsible for it.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.440]   You don't need to trust an insurance company.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.960]   You just need to trust that they're going to follow through
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.680]   on their contract.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.440]   You need to verify that they have the ability to do it.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.280]   You don't need to necessarily trust your bank.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.000]   You need to research them and make sure
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   that they have a good history and are capable of performing.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.160]   You are responsible.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.280]   I don't think it's a bad thing to have distrust.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.320]   But I think most of the people that are involved,
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.760]   which I guess is the question, is most of the people that
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.000]   are involved, they're not necessarily untrustworthy.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.360]   They are doing the best they can.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.200]   Most insurance agents I know are pretty good people.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.040]   And they really care.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.920]   And they're doing the best thing they can do.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.200]   So just ask them questions.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.960]   Let them do their job.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.600]   I hope I didn't get too much of that.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.160]   Next question.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.520]   Last question for today comes from Pete.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.080]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.640]   I'm going to just send you a voicemail
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.360]   since the mailing you a voice memo from my iPhone
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.840]   didn't work.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.920]   This is Pete up in Boston.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.580]   I love the show.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.240]   Call them one other time.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.360]   I have a question in general about investing in IPOs
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.200]   as part of a broader investment strategy.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:01.000]   In particular, I'm curious about the Shake Shack IPO tomorrow,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   which is a burger and fry joint that started in New York City
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.640]   and is expanding quite rapidly all over the world now.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.960]   But what is the role of that within a broader investment
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.520]   portfolio?
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.160]   Thanks so much.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.400]   Love the show.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.720]   So it's an interesting question.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.240]   And obviously, if any of you know,
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.720]   Shake Shack went public a couple months ago.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.040]   I sat on this intentionally for a few weeks
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.040]   because I didn't want to comment on Shake Shack.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:28.480]   And I also just got behind with Friday Q&A shows
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.200]   with the work on the new website.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.160]   But I do want to answer the question.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.660]   And I'm going to answer the question from two perspectives,
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.200]   from the portfolio question that Pete asked,
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:44.640]   and then also from the flip side of the portfolio question,
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.240]   and also the role of an IPO.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.320]   From a portfolio perspective, I don't
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.880]   think there's any difference of an IPO in your investment
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.720]   portfolio than any other aspect of your investment portfolio.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.000]   If you are going to invest in, let's say, Shake Shack,
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.280]   then you're going to have an investment philosophy.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.200]   It's going to be a reason why you're investing.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.660]   And then that investment philosophy
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.120]   is going to drive the role that that investment has
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.440]   in your portfolio.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.240]   If you are a short-term trader, and this
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.940]   is what you're doing, and you're managing
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.840]   your portfolio or a portion of your portfolio
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.720]   towards short-term trading, then you're
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:24.160]   going to be measuring the mood and the sentiment of the crowds.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.580]   And you're going to try to take a guess as to what you think
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.960]   is going to happen with the stock price once it goes live.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.080]   And you're going to go ahead, and you're
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.960]   going to put your trades in just like you
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.680]   are accustomed to doing.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.280]   If you're an investor, and you are accustomed to investing
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:45.960]   in quick, casual, or fine, casual, quick serve
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.160]   restaurants like Shake Shack, then you're going to sit down,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.620]   and you're going to say, well, where does this company stack
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:52.580]   up against its peers?
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.680]   What's the price that I think I can get it for?
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.600]   What are the earnings?
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.160]   What's the return on equity?
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.600]   How does this actually-- is this a good investment?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.900]   And you're going to slide it into your portfolio based
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.080]   upon that.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.400]   Now, what most people do when they're investing in IPOs is--
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.080]   not what most-- what some people do when they're investing in IPOs
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.920]   is they just jump in.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.880]   And sometimes that can work, and sometimes it can't.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.280]   Compare Shake Shack with Facebook as an example.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.080]   So if you're just a Shake Shack customer,
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.640]   and you say, well, I don't know anything about investing,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.880]   but I heard they're having an IPO,
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.420]   and so I want to just own some because I really
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.640]   like this company.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.240]   If you're right about your gut feeling of the company being
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.480]   a solid scenario, and if it's well-run,
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.320]   and if they do a good job of avoiding
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.480]   all the risks of their business and growing their empire,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   maybe it was a great decision.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.600]   Or maybe you just got in on a gut
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.400]   with actually no knowledge of investing
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.200]   and didn't actually sit down and figure out
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.760]   how much is the company worth?
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.040]   What's the intrinsic value?
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.320]   What am I willing to pay?
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.080]   How much of a premium am I willing to pay
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.600]   for their future growth versus their earnings currently,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.920]   et cetera?
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.440]   That's the hard type of investing
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.840]   that most people don't do.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.680]   So the role of an IPO in your portfolio
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.760]   should be congruent with your overall strategy and approach
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.400]   to investing.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:14.440]   And that's the major thing that most people need to focus on.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.160]   Do I know what my overall strategy and approach
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.720]   to investing is?
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.680]   Have I selected an asset allocation?
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.840]   Do I have a need for something that fits this?
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.560]   And it very well might be the fact
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.880]   that I always keep 5% of my liquid capital
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.760]   available for long shots that are home run options.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.320]   And I think Shake Shack is the next Chipotle.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   If that's the case, then you already know.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.960]   These things should be decided in advance of the IPO,
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.560]   and then the IPO just fits that characteristic.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.480]   Or if you're aware of an IPO that you know,
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.800]   OK, this company is kind of interesting,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.760]   then you should go back to your investment plan
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.000]   and you should see, how do I moderate this?
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.960]   How do I modify my asset allocations here?
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.520]   Where's the money going to come from?
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.320]   How is this going to fit?
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.920]   Is this going to overexpose me to the restaurant industry?
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.360]   Is this going to overexpose me to shakes and burgers
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.400]   and fries in an era where everyone's going
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.720]   to salads and chicken wraps?
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.560]   It's got to be built in as an investor into your portfolio,
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.240]   into your plans.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.160]   That's simply not how most people approach
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.880]   investing in an IPO who are talking about it.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.200]   Many people approach it from--
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.520]   individual people from an excitement perspective.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.440]   Sometimes it works out.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.400]   Academic research that I've read indicates
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.560]   that it mostly doesn't.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.120]   And that's why I want to talk about the role of an IPO.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.780]   I think it's important to recognize what
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.840]   the actual role of an IPO is.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.600]   Let's say that you started a burger joint that
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.800]   serves malts and burgers.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.000]   I guess we can do shakes.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.960]   Let's say that you started Shake Shack.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.800]   And you've grown this thing little by little,
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.120]   and you're growing pretty well.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.480]   You've got a pretty successful restaurant.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.400]   You've taken on a few investors.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.840]   What's the role of an IPO for you?
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.760]   It's diversification.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.000]   It's a way for you to cash out.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.240]   And to me, this is what most people don't seem to understand.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.040]   When an IPO is offered, it's being
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.720]   offered so that the current owners can cash out.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.160]   So the current owners are saying,
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.840]   we don't want to continue to own this,
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.880]   and we want to make our millions.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.360]   We want to convert this stock that we own,
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.680]   which we can't get cash for right now
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.960]   because it's privately held, and we want to convert it
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.320]   into money.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.760]   Everyone who's involved on the sell side of an IPO
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.520]   has an incentive to get the highest price possible.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.200]   So if the owner of the company-- let's
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.160]   say there's an individual owner, and then there
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.720]   are a few early stage investors, some angel investors that
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.120]   came in, and they own that.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.200]   If the owners of the company, they need an exit plan.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.320]   That's what these guys do, people
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.660]   that run a venture capital firm.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.760]   They need an exit plan.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.200]   OK, we're going to come along.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.040]   We're going to invest in your small company.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.320]   We think it's going to multiply by 5x
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.520]   within this period of time.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.060]   We think it's going to multiply by 20x
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.400]   within this period of time.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.000]   And our exit is, yes, this is a type of industry
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.480]   that's going to do well in an IPO.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.800]   And that's how they cash out.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.920]   They've got to find a buyer.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.680]   And you're the buyer in the IPO.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.680]   So the seller has an incentive to get the highest
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.360]   price possible.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.640]   The individual owner or owners who started the company
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.160]   have the incentive to get the highest price possible,
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.520]   because they're giving up ownership and control now.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.000]   They've got to deal with the hassle of going public.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.400]   The early stage investors who may have funded the company,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.120]   they've got an incentive, because this
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.560]   is how they're going to measure their return on equity.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.600]   Also, the investment bank that's handling the offering,
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.720]   the investment bank is being paid based upon commission.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.760]   It could be a fee, depending on how they've arranged it.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.680]   But in essence, they're getting a commission.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.520]   And their job is to market this product, the stock
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.400]   that they're selling, at the highest possible price
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.480]   they think the market will bear.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.200]   This is why you'll see the market adjust.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.040]   And they're offering it at the highest price.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.960]   And the higher the price and the more shares they can sell,
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.920]   the more money they'll make.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.680]   So they go out, and they do their roadshow.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.040]   And they go out, and they offer their terms sheets.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.480]   And here's all the company, and here's all the information on
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:14.980]   it.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.720]   And they're trying to whip up the market
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.440]   into a froth, a frenzy of people saying,
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.840]   we want to buy this company.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.520]   Every IPO is a great investment.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.480]   So you recognize that.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.320]   The decks are kind of stacked a little bit against you.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.760]   Now, of course, they've got to release all the information.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.800]   They've got to do a full disclosure.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.520]   And so that can help you.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.360]   But recognize that everyone on the other side
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.120]   is trying to get the highest possible price.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.760]   That's different than a stock that's
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.560]   traded for a period of time, and you're just
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.920]   buying some shares that are being offered.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.680]   And especially if you're trading in a small volume,
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.640]   and there's always shares available,
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.120]   you don't know what's going on.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.600]   And just on any given day, the share price
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.400]   reflects the totality of all the investors.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.280]   But in an IPO, the initial public offering price
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.040]   is reflecting the highest price they can get.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.960]   Now, of course, they need to get an incentive.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.000]   They need to theoretically sell and offer it
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.800]   at a lower price than what it's worth so that you'll buy it
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.600]   then, and they can get the market going for it.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.320]   So it all works pretty well.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.000]   The research indicates that usually the IPOs
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.800]   tend to underperform.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.960]   Most people don't seem to understand that, at least
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.920]   the offering process.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.800]   So I say tread carefully.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.200]   If there is a company that you feel very strongly about,
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.840]   and you sit down, and you run the value,
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.520]   and you say, here's what the value of this company is worth.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.680]   Here is what I'd be willing to pay
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.320]   for this business, which is a good way to approach stock
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.320]   investing.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.040]   I'd be willing to pay total--
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.240]   if I could buy this business today for this amount of money,
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.440]   here's what I would be willing to pay.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.600]   And then you can get it at the per share price
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.280]   that you're happy with, fine.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.160]   And if that comes in the form of an IPO, awesome.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.280]   There are some IPOs that have done--
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.960]   all companies have gone through an IPO initially.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.720]   But by that, there's some companies
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.220]   that have gone public recently that
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.880]   have continued to perform well.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.720]   And there are many companies who haven't.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.040]   So as long as you understand the game,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.680]   and you know who the suckers are--
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.520]   what's the old quote from poker?
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.800]   I can't remember exactly, but basically, there's
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.960]   a sucker in every game.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.720]   And if you don't know-- or there's a patsy in every game.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.060]   If you don't know who the patsy is or who the sucker is,
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:32.760]   it's you.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.280]   Make sure you're not the sucker.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.720]   Make sure you know what's going on,
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.320]   and you're dealing with something that
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.520]   is a business that you're confident in.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.000]   And hey, if there's a restaurant that you love,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.960]   and you just want to send some money that way
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.440]   as a show of support and something to tell your kids,
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.080]   go for it.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.920]   There's lots of things we can spend money on.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.680]   So you can't get too serious about it.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.080]   But that would be how I would answer your question.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.600]   Hope that helps.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.800]   I guess the last caveat is just I'm really not
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   an expert on that type of thing.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.760]   So I know the process, but I've never been involved.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.480]   I've never worked inside of an investment bank.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.200]   I've never been a trader trying to swoop up shares on day one.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.820]   So it's more for me an academic knowledge,
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.360]   and that's what I've shared with you.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.440]   So if anybody else out there is more knowledgeable or knows
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.520]   of great resources, feel free to come by for today's show
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.760]   and comment and share those with us.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.200]   Hopefully that was helpful to you guys.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.880]   I know I was a little bit loose and made some mistakes
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.480]   and whatever.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.600]   But hopefully this was helpful to you.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.920]   I had fun with these questions.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   These are great questions.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.000]   Love to answer your questions.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.120]   So make sure you come by radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.960]   leave a voicemail.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.720]   Hope these answers have been useful to you.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.320]   If you're enjoying these answers and if it's
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.040]   been beneficial to you, please consider
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.640]   becoming a patron of the show.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.520]   The patrons are the reason why so far I'm
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.120]   able to keep the show commercial free,
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.860]   free of corporate interests, free of all of that crap
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.880]   that I really would like to avoid.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.920]   And the goal is to get the Patreon subscriptions up
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.440]   to $6,000 a month by June 1.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.240]   And let me tell you where we are right now.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:15.880]   Right now we are at $1,218.50 per month.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.520]   So if you're not supporting the show yet, there's room for you.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.880]   If every member had listened to the show, $2 a month,
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.040]   we would be there today.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.480]   And many of you go ahead and sign up at a much higher rate.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.480]   And I want to thank you for that.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   Next week we will be doing the monthly Google Hangout
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.160]   Q&A for patrons of the show at $10 a month and up.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.080]   So if you would like this weekend to get in before that,
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.120]   come by radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.160]   and sign up at the $10 a month level and up.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.120]   And you'll get access to that in addition to all
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.320]   of the other benefits for the previous levels.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.440]   So I think that's it.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.320]   It's a beautiful Friday here in South Florida.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.200]   I hope that those of you who live in the frozen, frigid
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   north that you're warming up a little bit.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.600]   I'm going to go out and fire up the grill and spend some time
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.920]   and spend some of my life energy with those that I love.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.960]   I'm going to cook some steaks on the grill tonight
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.880]   and have a good time with my family.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.760]   Doing a little financial coaching over dinner
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.720]   as well, if someone's coming over for dinner.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.720]   So the perks of being a financial advisor.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.840]   And the perks of not wearing a suit and tie anymore.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.280]   So sometimes you do financial advice
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.160]   over steak and baked potatoes.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.280]   So y'all have a lovely weekend.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.640]   We'll talk with you next week.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:02.200]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education,
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.800]   and financial enlightenment.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.200]   But your situation is unique, and I cannot deliver
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.520]   any actionable advice without knowing anything about you.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.000]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.400]   who you find to be caring, competent, and trustworthy.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.000]   And consult them, because they are
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.440]   the ones who can understand your specific needs,
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.720]   your specific goals, and provide specific answers
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.520]   to your questions.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.360]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.640]   in today's show.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.320]   But I'm one person, and I make mistakes.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.560]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.000]   please help me by coming to the show page
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.200]   and commenting so we can all learn together.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.560]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
