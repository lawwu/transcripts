[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:16.040]   the book of Exodus, in chapter 33, reading from verse 18 to the end of the chapter. Book
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:27.840]   of Exodus, chapter 33, verses 18 to 23. "And he said," that's to say, Moses said, "I
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:40.240]   beseech thee, show me thy glory. And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.080]   and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:56.520]   be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. And he said, thou canst not
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:06.920]   see my face, for there shall no men see me and live. And the Lord said, Behold, there
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.360]   is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock, and it shall come to pass, while my
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.980]   glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cliff to the rock, and will cover thee with
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:33.440]   my hand while I pass by. And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:48.560]   but my face shall not be seen." We thus continue our study and examination of this great 33rd
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.280]   chapter of the book of Exodus, in which, as most of you will recall, we have an account
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.960]   of this extraordinary experience, indeed a series of experiences, that were given to
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.560]   Moses, the servant of God. Let me hurriedly remind you of the background and the context.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.780]   The children of Israel had been guilty of that grievous sin of making and worshipping
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:23.580]   a golden calf, while Moses was up on the mount with God. And God had shown his displeasure
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.080]   at that, and had punished the children of Israel very severely. But you remember that
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.600]   Moses had interceded on their behalf. And then God had commended Moses to continue with
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.040]   the march and to take the children of Israel up to Canaan, telling him that he himself
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.560]   would not accompany them. He would send his angel, but his own presence would not be with
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   them. And that, you remember, led to the action on behalf of Moses and others. Moses took
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   the tent of meeting, which hitherto had been in the midst of the camp, he took it and set
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.640]   it up outside the camp. And there he went and interceded with God on behalf of the children
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.040]   of Israel, and various others joined with him in doing so. And Moses' prayer was,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.000]   you remember, that God should return, should have pity and compassion. And God hearkened,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.440]   and his presence came back again. The people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.160]   door, and the result of that was that they rose up and worshipped every man in his own
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   tent. God spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend. And Moses went
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.560]   back and reported all this to the children of Israel, leaving Joshua in the tent of meeting.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.160]   And then having reported to the people he went back again. And he went on praying, and
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.520]   you remember we found that he asked God for something further. He asked God for a definite
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:03.840]   personal assurance. "If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence." And
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.040]   then he asked God for some unusual manifestation of himself, in order that the nations, that
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   the people round and about them might know that he and the children of Israel had found
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.680]   grace in the sight of God. He says, "How shall they know that, except that thou goest
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.360]   with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:37.240]   the face of the earth." And we have considered how Moses offered that prayer. We have noticed
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   his method of reasoning and of arguing with God, pleading the promises. And have realized
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.920]   that that is the model for all our prayers. The more we know the Scriptures, the more
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.680]   we know the promises of God, the better able shall we be to pray. And God delights to hear
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.720]   his children using these arguments, reasoning with him, pointing out to him what he said
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.680]   himself. Well, Moses, you remember, prayed in that way. And God turned to him and said,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.200]   "I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in my sight,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:26.120]   and I know thee by name." And we were considering last Sunday morning, in terms of the message
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.040]   of Pentecost, how it was that God answers that particular prayer.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.680]   Very well. Now that brings us to this section that we are looking at this morning, this
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.440]   third and final section of this great chapter. One of the most extraordinary things, surely,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:56.160]   that is to be found anywhere in the whole compass of Holy Writ. It is one of those paragraphs
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:04.760]   which one can only approach with considerable hesitancy and uncertainty. We are treading
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:14.320]   on very holy ground, and we should face a statement such as this with awe. I feel that
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.360]   the word comes to us that came to Moses himself on that occasion at the burning bush. "Take
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.920]   off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground." A
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   most extraordinary and amazing episode, I say. And yet we must follow it, because I
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.240]   think we shall see, as we do so, that this takes us yet a further step and a further
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:52.360]   stage in our understanding of what happens when God graciously visits his Church and
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:00.760]   people with revival and reawakening. That is still our fundamental theme. All these
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:08.520]   considerations of different portions of Scripture are designed to that end, that we may have
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:16.440]   a deeper and a clearer conception as to what exactly does happen when God gives and sends
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.800]   a special visitation of his Holy Spirit in what we normally call a revival.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.440]   Now let me make this quite plain and clear. We are dealing with the subject in general
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.600]   particularly, but though we are dealing with it in general and as it affects a number of
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.200]   people at the same time, we must never forget that all this is possible to the individual.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.600]   There are people who don't seem to be quite clear about this, and that is why I am giving
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.240]   this word of explanation in passing. It is possible for an individual, on his or her
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.640]   own, to have any one of these experiences that we are describing, that we are illustrating
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:05.740]   from the Scripture. A revival is just that state and condition in which that happens
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:12.840]   to a number of people at the same time. That is what is meant by revival. But we must never
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:20.600]   forget that it is always possible to the individual. So as we consider these principles, let us
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.640]   hold on to that fact. There is no need, in other words, for us of necessity to wait until
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.160]   a revival comes to experience some of these things. We can seek them individually. But
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:38.520]   God, from time to time, is pleased to grant such experiences to large numbers, all together,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.480]   to a whole church, to a district, to a whole country perhaps, or to many countries in the
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:53.400]   world as he did a hundred years ago in 1858. But the blessing is not confined to revival.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:59.080]   It is always possible, I say, to the individual in isolation.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:05.240]   Well, now then, bearing that in mind, let us proceed to consider what we are told here.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:13.000]   We can divide our matter like this. The first thing, obviously, is Moses' request. And
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.080]   he said, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory." Now, this is the thing, I say, that really
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:34.240]   almost staggers one. Moses is still not satisfied. And you remember what that means. He is not
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.040]   satisfied in spite of all that God had promised him, and in spite of all that he had just
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:48.840]   been receiving. Consider this man Moses, who had been up on the mount with God forty days
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.600]   and forty nights, there in communion with him. He had already experienced that. He has
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   already had the experiences that are recorded in this chapter, where God, we are told, "Speak
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.440]   unto him face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend a most unusual thing." And then
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   that further request, God says, "I will even grant you that," and gives him some
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:25.240]   immediate assurance and satisfaction. And yet Moses goes further. He is not satisfied.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:32.560]   He does not stop. He goes on and says, "Show me thy glory."
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:40.080]   This is what we may very well describe as the daring quality that always comes into
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.040]   great faith. You will find other illustrations of this in other places in the Scripture.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:55.160]   But here is perhaps one of the most remarkable of all, the daring of Moses. He ventures to
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.360]   go on, to ask for something still further. He seems to rise from step to step. As God
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.320]   says, "Yes, I will grant you even this, give me more," says Moses. And here he
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:12.960]   makes what is in many ways the final and the ultimate request. This request, namely, that
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.880]   he may see and know the glory of God.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:26.040]   Now, here is the thing which must concern us, particularly this morning. Let me put
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.120]   it to you like this, before we go any further. Do we know anything about these advancing
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   steps and stages? As we look back across our Christian experience, do we know what it is
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   to rise like this from step to step, and from platform to platform? Do we know this increasing
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:02.880]   boldness in the presence of God, this increasing assurance, this desire for yet more and more,
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.080]   while we thank God for all that we have received, as Moses did, this longing for yet something
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:17.440]   above and beyond, this striving, this rising, this scaling the heights, as it were?
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   Now, this is a principle which is taught in the Bible, "To him that hath shall be given,
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:32.520]   and he shall have abundance." I am simply asking whether we know anything about this.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.800]   And I ask it because I have the most uncomfortable feeling that it is true to say of so many
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:45.840]   of us—yes, even those of us who are evangelical people—that our main characteristic is self-satisfaction.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.960]   And the feeling that we have arrived, because we are converted and we may have had some
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.840]   other experience or believed something further, well, there we are. All we have to do is to
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.520]   maintain the position, and we are looking down upon those who have not arrived where
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:11.560]   we are. How much evidence is there of striving, seeking, rising on the wings of faith, following
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.480]   in the footsteps of Moses and saying, "Oh, I thank you for what you have promised, but
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.880]   show me now thy glory"? Let me put it then directly by putting it like this. To what
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:34.280]   extent are we aware of a desire for God himself and for a knowledge of the glory of God? I
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:42.160]   imagine that this is the highest reaches of faith. Moses, you see, is no longer asking
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.800]   God for particular blessings. He has done that, but he doesn't stop at that. He has
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:57.840]   gone beyond blessings. He has gone beyond the gifts. He is now seeking God for himself,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:07.880]   for his own sake. He is now filled with a passion for a personal knowledge, confrontation,
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:15.520]   meeting with God himself. He doesn't despise the gifts. It is rather that because of the
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.880]   gifts and because of the glimpses he has received of the glory of God in the matter of the gifts,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.720]   that now forgetting himself and all gifts and blessings, he just has this longing for
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:35.400]   God himself and for the glory of God. Well, that is the question I think that should
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:46.640]   come to all of us. Do we know anything of such a longing? How long have you been a Christian?
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:55.400]   It may be many years. Have you ever had this longing at all? Have you ever really longed
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:05.960]   for some personal, direct knowledge and experience of God? Oh, I know. We pray for causes. We
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   pray for the Church. We pray for missionaries. We pray for our own efforts that we organize.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yes, that is not what I am talking about. We ask for personal blessings. I am just asking,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:23.520]   how much do we know of this desire for God himself? That is what Moses said, "Show
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:30.720]   me thy glory. Take me yet a step nearer." Well, it is the same thing, of course, as
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:41.440]   the psalmist said in Psalm 42, "As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:49.760]   my heart after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for thee, for the living God." That is the
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:16:00.520]   thing. He wants the living God himself. "My soul thirsteth." This panting, this thirsting,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:07.160]   for God himself. Now, I say this is the thing. You get it again
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.200]   in Psalm 17, verse 15, "As for me," says the psalmist looking forward to what is coming,
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:21.880]   "As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.840]   likeness." Now, I am holding this before you for this
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:35.600]   reason. Here, you see, were the desires of men under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:44.560]   Moses and the psalmist. These were men who simply looked at the promises of the gospel
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.800]   afar off. They had not seen them, but they saw them afar off. They had their eye upon
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.640]   them. They believed that they were coming. Ah, yes, but they had not yet come, they had
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:02.280]   not yet happened. As Abram saw my day, says Christ, he saw it, he believed it, he saw
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.560]   it afar off. So did all these men, says the author of the Hebrews in chapter 11. They
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:14.240]   had not yet received the promises. They believed them. They saw them afar off. And you see,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:23.360]   here are these men in that position, longing to see and to know the glory of God.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.480]   Now, you and I are living in the new dispensation. We are not looking forward to the coming of
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.840]   the Messiah. We are not looking forward to Calvary. We are looking back. We have got
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.720]   these records in the New Testament, explicit statements, the whole thing unfolded, the
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:48.320]   Holy Spirit has been given. And yet I wonder how we compare this morning with the Psalmist
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:57.160]   and with Moses. What's the matter with us, my friends? We who like to boast about our
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.600]   superiority over the Old Testament saints, some of us even to the extent of being so
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.440]   foolish as not to believe that they were saints at all, how do we compare with them in actual
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:15.400]   experience? Of course these people were the children of God. But I say they were living
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.840]   in the dim light of the old dispensation, whereas you and I are in the new. And yet
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:27.320]   here they are. "Show me thy glory." Notice the intimate knowledge which the Psalmist
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:41.200]   also has of God. Now then, let me put it like this. This is the ultimate, the end of the
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:52.280]   true seeking for revival. The prayer for revival is ultimately a prayer based upon a concern
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:19:01.640]   for the manifestation of the glory of God. Remember what I've said, that this can happen
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:10.880]   individually as well as collectively. But here it is. Moses, you see, knew of the glory
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.200]   of God. He hadn't seen it, but he knew. He believed God. He'd accepted the revelation.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.340]   He'd had odd manifestations here and there. And on the strength of this, he says, "Now
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:29.440]   let me see it, let it be manifested." And that should be our position. Here we are in
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.360]   this difficult world. We see the church as she is languishing. We see the sin and evil
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:41.060]   that are rampant, round and about us. Now we know that God is there in all his glory.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.600]   And I say that what is necessary is that we should be moved, as Moses was, to desire the
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:54.020]   manifestation of this glory. It's almost inconceivable, isn't it, that there should
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:00.960]   be anybody who doesn't offer this prayer of Moses. Isn't it difficult to understand
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.840]   how anybody can be satisfied with things as they are now? But there are many such people.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.160]   They say, "What's all this talk about revival and praying for revival? Aren't things going
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.520]   well? Isn't the evangelical church doing well? What's all this?" Oh, my dear friend,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.640]   if you speak like that, you're just displaying this, that you really know very little about
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:26.200]   God himself. You're interested in things happening, in results, in activities, in blessings.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.600]   Don't you know anything for a longing to see the manifestation of the glory of God?
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:39.120]   Don't you know anything about some thirst for God himself? Is it, I wonder, that some
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:50.360]   of us are so busy that we don't have time even to think about God? God's not a force.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:59.500]   God is personal. God in three persons—Father, Son, Holy Spirit—personal. Have we forgotten
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:06.000]   this personal element, I wonder? And are we tending loosely and in our great hurry and
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.720]   busyness to think of God only as some agency that blesses? There's no doubt about this.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:23.000]   As we advance in faith and in knowledge and in experience, we shall more and more desire
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.120]   God himself, and not only and not merely the things that are given to us by God. You see,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.660]   the apostle Paul puts this so perfectly in his own case. Here was a man who had received
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:41.560]   so much and had had so unusual blessings, yet this is what he says in Philippians 3.10,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   you remember, "That I might know him." Well, you'd have said, "If ever a man did
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.480]   know Christ, it was the apostle Paul." But you know, he wasn't satisfied. "That I
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:58.320]   might know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, me being
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.520]   made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.220]   from the dead, not that I have already apprehended." Says this man who has apprehended so much,
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.720]   this man who has had such unusual experiences, not as though I had already apprehended. No,
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.840]   you see, the point is he's had such tastes of it, he wants more. He wants to know him
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:26.720]   himself. So he forgets the things that are behind, and he presses forward toward the
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.400]   mark. Well, I'm simply emphasizing this. It's no use our talking about these things
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.360]   if we don't desire them, if we don't know something about them. I ask once more, "To
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:46.320]   what extent, my dear friends, do you know of a longing for God himself, for the living
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:55.440]   God? Show me thy glory." Well, then that brings us to God's answer.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.240]   And this is a matter, of course, that we of necessity must divide up under various headings.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.480]   The first thing that we see quite clearly is this, that God answers Moses by telling
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.640]   him, "Yes, I am going to answer your prayer, your petition, but I'm going to do so in
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:20.600]   my own way." And we must consider this. And the first thing that strikes us at once
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:30.520]   is this, that it was a partial answer. We shall also go on to consider, God willing,
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:37.080]   the means or the method or the way in which God gives the partial answer. And we shall
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.680]   consider thirdly, the nature of the answer. Because it's all here. But let us start
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.600]   with the first thing, the partial character or nature of God's answer. And here it is
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:55.120]   in verse 20, "God said to Moses, 'Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.920]   men see me and live.'" And again in verse 23, "And I will take away my hand, and
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:10.600]   thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen." Here we are face to
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.400]   face with the final mystery, you see. The answer is going to be given, yes, but in this
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.360]   partial manner. Now, this must be the case. There surely should be no difficulty about
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:34.000]   this. "No men shall see me and live." No man, in other words, is capable of standing
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.720]   the full vision of God's glory. He couldn't stand it, it would kill him. Why? Well, because
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:49.960]   of the inconceivable nature of the glory. My dear friends, there is no doubt at all
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:56.280]   about it. Ninety-nine point nine percent of our troubles as Christians is that we are
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:05.640]   ignorant of God, just sheer ignorance of God. We spend so much time in feeling our own pulse,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   taking our own spiritual temperature, considering our moods and states and feelings. Oh, if
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:26.240]   we but had some conception of him, the inconceivable glory of God, immortal, invisible, God only
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:40.680]   in our eyes, in light inaccessible, hid from our eyes. "No men shall see me and live."
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   Moses didn't quite realize what he was asking, so God corrects him and he teaches him. He
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:55.280]   does it gently, with tenderness, shows him exactly what is possible and what isn't possible.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.780]   This is not peculiar to Moses. You remember Isaiah, when he had a glimpse of him? Read
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:08.040]   it in chapter six of his prophecy. When he was just given a glimpse of that ineffable
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:17.360]   glory, he cried out, saying, "Woe is unto me, for I am undone. I am a man of unclean
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:25.080]   lips." He heard the voices, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts." And the house
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.040]   was filled with smoke and the pillars of the door moved. Just a glimpse of it. "Woe is
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:39.400]   unto me," says Isaiah, "I am unfit for this, I am unworthy." He staggered. John,
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:46.080]   the apostle, tells us that when he likewise was given just some vague indication of it,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:55.200]   "I fell down as one dead." These were men, let me remind you, living in this world,
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.140]   in the flesh, as you and I live in this world in the flesh. And they've had such experiences
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:08.240]   of God. Why haven't we had them? Why do we know so little about these things? These
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.840]   are the things that are to be a part of the life of the Christian. Christianity is to
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.920]   know God. This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:24.480]   Christ whom thou hast sent. Not know about God only, but to know God. Well, there they
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.800]   are. And you remember the apostle Paul himself, as Saul of Tarsus. There he is on the road
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:39.400]   to Damascus. And suddenly he sees that light above the brightest shining of the sun. And
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.240]   you remember what happened to him. He fell down on the road, and he was blinded by it.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.680]   Why? Well, it's the glory that did that to him. The sight of the glory was such. We
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.900]   ought to be able to have some increasing understanding of all this today. You read about the explosion
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.840]   of these atomic bombs, don't you? And how people have to be very careful to shade their
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.920]   eyes, the brightness of this flash. You've got to multiply that by infinity to know something
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:12.240]   about the glory of God. You remember that the apostles, the disciples of our Lord on
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.160]   the Mount of Transfiguration, even when they saw this transfiguration, a kind of deep sleep
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.280]   came over them. Why? Well, it was to protect them. The glory is so transcendent. It's
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   blinding. It's inconceivable. And then you remember the apostle again tells us in 2 Corinthians
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.960]   12, that he had an experience some fourteen years before he was writing. And this is how
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.480]   he says, "Whether in the body or out of the body, I know not." It was so marvelous,
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.320]   he says, "I don't quite know." He was in a state and in a condition which he really
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.680]   cannot describe with accuracy. "Ah, but," says someone, "that only happened to men
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.760]   in the Scriptures." No, no. This is something that has gone on happening to God's people
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.200]   who have realized the possibilities and who have sought God himself throughout the running
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.320]   centuries. Have you ever read of Jonathan Edwards describing his experience of it when
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   he was there kneeling in a forest once for about an hour? I'll give you a short account
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:14.360]   of it later on. Have you read of David Brainerd, the great apostle to those American Indians,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:20.320]   there experiencing the glory of God and literally sweating, though it was cold and though it
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.120]   was freezing round and about him? What was causing the sweating? Oh, it was the glory,
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:32.800]   the character and the transcendence of the glory. And to give you a man who is much nearer
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:43.380]   to ourselves, D. L. Moody, a very strong man physically, a very sturdy man. Yet you remember
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:50.040]   that when God gave him this glimpse of his glory, he had to ask God to desist and to
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.440]   hold back his hand. He felt it was killing him. He's not the only one who's felt that.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   I could quote you others who've said exactly the same thing. The man felt that his literal
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   physical frame was cracking and was breaking under the glory and has to ask God to hold
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   back his hand. Thou shalt not see my face, for no man shall see me and live. I'll give
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.080]   you just some indication of it. I'll give you a fleeting glimpse of it, but you can't
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:28.400]   see me as I am. No, no, my back parts only.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.080]   Well now, as you come again to the question of revival, you will find a great deal of
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:44.680]   this. You will find that when God manifests himself, and by an outpouring of the Spirit,
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:50.000]   whose special work and commission it is to manifest the Lord Jesus and his glory and
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.660]   through him, God himself, you will find that you will often read things like this, that
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.840]   men and women in the presence of this glory and of this presence have literally fallen
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   to the ground, have fainted. Ah, say somebody, these phenomena. My dear friend, don't be
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.480]   interested in or frightened in phenomena. I'm just reporting to you that God himself
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:21.840]   has said that the glory is so glorious that man's physical frame is inadequate. So don't
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   be surprised if you read, when you read these reports of people fainting or going off into
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:37.400]   a kind of dead swoon. It's the glory of God. It's beyond us. And it's not surprising,
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.760]   then, that it should sometimes lead to such consequences. The partial nature.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.680]   Well, but let me go on and say this, that though the answer is partial, it is nevertheless
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:55.800]   very definite. "You shall not see my face," says God to Moses, "but you are going to
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:02.440]   see something." And what is he going to see? Well, he is going to see God passing
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.840]   by. "The Lord said, 'Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   rock, and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.640]   a cliff to the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by, and I will take away
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.440]   my hand, and thou shalt see my back pass.'" He's passing by. Do you know what a revival
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:31.520]   is? Now, that's a perfect description of it. It's the glory of God passing by. That's
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:40.160]   precisely what it is. Just this glimpse of God as He passes by. The God who is there
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.320]   in the glory, as it were, comes down, pays a visit, pours out His Spirit, descends again,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.800]   and He just passes by us, and we look on and feel and know that the glory of God is in
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:33:01.000]   the midst and is passing by. Oh, it's but a touching of the hymn, as it were. It's
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.280]   but a vision of the back. You know, let me give you a comparison which may help. What
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.000]   is thunder and lightning? Well, according to the psalmist, and according to the Bible
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.680]   everywhere, thunder and lightning are but a kind of indication of God's power. The
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.960]   God who said at the beginning, "Let there be light," and there was light. Well,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.240]   now, He just gives you an indication of what His power is in the flash of the lightning,
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:36.600]   the roar of the thunder. These are but glimpses of God's might, God's power, God's
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:45.480]   eternal ability. Very well. A revival, I say, is just a kind of touch of His glory, a fleeting
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:54.680]   glimpse of something of what He is in and of Himself. And I'm emphasizing this, my
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.920]   dear friends, because you and I must come to realize that these things are possible
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:06.680]   and these things are meant for us. We were never meant to be content with a little. Let
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.560]   me therefore give you some scriptural indications of the possibility of this. I've already
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.840]   reminded you of what happened to Saul of Tarsus there on the road to Damascus. Suddenly there
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:23.640]   shined round about him light from heaven. That happened to a man, remember. And then
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.960]   I must read you again this description which he gives in 2 Corinthians 12. It is not expedient
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:36.200]   for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.840]   a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, whether in the body I cannot tell or whether
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth, such an one caught up into the third heaven.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.400]   And I knew such a man, whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth,
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:59.120]   how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:11.360]   for a man to utter. That was an experience received by the Apostle Paul himself. A man
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.520]   of like passions with ourselves, a man still in the body, still in this world, still in
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:24.880]   the flesh, he has had this experience of the glory itself in this veiled and in this partial
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.360]   manner. But he had other experiences. There he was in Corinth and he found everybody against
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.400]   him. And he went to bed one night very troubled. But this is what I read. Then spake the Lord
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:45.920]   to Paul in the night by a vision, visions and experiences of the glory of God. And the
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.320]   result of this is that he is able to say, "He knows the Lord Jesus Christ so well
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.520]   that he says to me, 'To live is Christ and to die is gain, that I might be with Christ
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:02.800]   which is far better.'" Can you say that? Can you say, "To me, to live is Christ"?
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:09.440]   If we cannot say it, then why can't we say it? Why shouldn't we say it? It is meant
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.560]   for all. The Apostle nowhere teaches that this was only meant for himself or merely
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.960]   for the Apostles. He is telling these Philippians this, that they may have the same experience.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   John says, "These things write we unto you, that ye may have fellowship with us, and our
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.600]   fellowship truly is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ." We are all meant
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:36.760]   to be enjoying these experiences. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:43.080]   me. But then you see the Apostle puts it like this. This is the counterpart to what we have
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:49.520]   heard in Exodus 33. "For now," says the Apostle, "we see through a glass darkly,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.940]   but then face to face." The hand is upon us now. We are only seeing through a glass
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.960]   darkly. Yes, but we do see through a glass darkly. That is the thing I am emphasizing.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.880]   Even here in this world, we see through a glass darkly. An enigma in a riddle, if you
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:11.360]   like. Yes, but we do see. And the question I am asking is, are we seeing it? Then I know
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.480]   it will be face to face. But the question is, what now? Or take that last verse in the
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   third chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians, which I read to you at the beginning
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:28.400]   this morning. "But we all with open face beholding as in a glass." It is still only
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.920]   partial, you see. It is beholding as in a kind of reflection from a mirror. Yes, but
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:42.440]   it is that, beholding as in a glass. What? The glory of the Lord. Are you with open face
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:50.800]   beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord? Can you say honestly with the Apostle Paul,
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.680]   "God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath sung into our hearts to
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:07.320]   reveal the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Can
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.640]   we appropriate the words of Peter in his first epistle, in the first chapter and verse eight,
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:22.800]   and say, "Whom having not seen, we love. In whom though now we see him not yet believing,
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:33.600]   we rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory." Can you say that? "But I believe
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.320]   in the Lord Jesus Christ. I have rejoiced in my salvation." I am not asking you that.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.880]   What Peter says is this, that the Christian is a man who so knows him and loves him that
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:56.080]   he rejoices in him with a joy that is unspeakable, baffles description, and full of glory. In
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:03.100]   revival, men and women in large numbers are able to say that. The glory of God has come
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.660]   near, has passed by, they have seen his back parts, and they have been able to use those
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:16.760]   words with absolute honesty. You see, all this is a kind of foretaste of heaven, but
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:23.640]   we are to enjoy foretastes of heaven here in this world. "Blessed are the pure in heart,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.800]   for they shall see God." Our Lord's prayer for his own is this, "Father, I will that
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.000]   they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.080]   which thou hast given me, for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world."
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:50.120]   Then, says John, we shall see him as he is, and we shall be like him. Then, as our hymn
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:57.080]   has just put it, his glory, full disclosed, shall open to our sight. Yes, but my dear
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:04.240]   friends, before we come to that, we should have these partial views here in this world.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:10.440]   Not the full disclosure that is to come, but the partial disclosure.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:16.720]   And the question I am asking is this. Do we know anything of these things? Well, now let
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:23.680]   me encourage you by just reading a few excerpts to you. Take Jonathan Edwards first. Sometimes
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:31.480]   he says, "Only mentioning a single word caused my heart to burn within me," or "Only
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.960]   seeing the name of Christ or the name of some attribute of God, and God has appeared glorious
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.480]   to me on account of the Trinity. It has made me have exalting thoughts of God that he subsists
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:50.200]   in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The sweetest joys and delights I have experienced
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.960]   have not been those that have arisen from a hope of my own good estate, but in a direct
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:02.440]   view of the glorious things of the Gospel. When I enjoy this sweetness, it seems to carry
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.960]   me above the thoughts of my own estate. It seems at such times a loss that I cannot bear
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:14.640]   to take my eye off from the glorious, pleasant object I behold without me, to turn my eye
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.080]   in upon myself and my own good estate." Then listen to this. "Once, as I rode out
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:27.040]   into the woods for my health in 1737, having alighted from my horse in a retired place
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:34.200]   as my manner commonly has been to walk for divine contemplation and prayer, I had a view
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:41.480]   that for me was extraordinary of the glory of the Son, of God as mediator between God
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:49.800]   and men, and his wonderful, great, full, pure, and sweet grace and love, and meek and gentle
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:56.320]   condescension. This grace that appeared so calm and sweet appeared also great above the
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:02.800]   heavens. The person of Christ appeared ineffably excellent, with an excellency great enough
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.240]   to swallow up all thought and conception, which continued as near as I can judge about
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:15.480]   an hour, which kept me the greater part of the time in a flood of tears and weeping aloud.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.880]   I felt an ardency of soul to be, what I know not otherwise how to express, emptied and
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.560]   annihilated, to lie in the dust and to be full of Christ alone, to love him with a holy
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.520]   and pure love, to trust in him, to live upon him, to serve and to follow him, and to be
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:39.680]   perfectly sanctified and made pure with a divine and heavenly purity. I have several
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:47.160]   other times had views very much of the same nature and which have had the same effects.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.560]   That's Jonathan Edwards. What should I do about all this, says someone. Let Spurgeon
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:43:00.440]   answer the question. Here is Spurgeon in one of his Revival Year sermons, just reprinted
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:10.680]   on page 77. Let me say now, says Spurgeon, before I turn from this pint, that it is possible
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:18.840]   for a man to know whether God has called him or not, and he may know it too beyond a doubt.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.240]   He may know it as surely as if he had read it with his own eyes. Nay, he may know it
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:30.400]   more surely than that, for if I read a thing with my eyes, even my eyes may deceive me.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:39.040]   The testimony of sense may be false, but the testimony of the Spirit must be true. We have
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.740]   the witness of the Spirit within, bearing witness with our spirits that we are born
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:50.640]   of God. There is such a thing on earth as an infallible assurance of our election. Let
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.920]   a man once get that, and it will anoint his head with fresh oil, it will clothe him with
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:01.360]   a white garment of praise, and put the song of the angel in his mouth. Happy, happy man
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.840]   who is fully assured of his interest in the covenant of grace, in the blood of atonement,
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:14.040]   and in the glories of heaven. What would some of you give if you could arrive at this assurance?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:23.760]   Mark, if you anxiously desire to know, you may know. If your heart tempts to read its
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:31.420]   title clear, it shall do so ere long. No man ever desired Christ in his heart with a living
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:38.200]   and longing desire, who did not find him sooner or later. If thou hast a desire, God has given
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.400]   it thee. If thou pentest, and cryest, and groanest after Christ, even this is his gift.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:52.640]   Bless him for it. Thank him for a little grace, and ask him for great grace. These are the
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:58.180]   steps of Moses. Thank him for a little grace, and ask him for great grace. He has given
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.120]   thee hope; ask for faith; and when he gives thee faith, ask for assurance; and when thou
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   gettest assurance, ask for full assurance; and when thou hast obtained full assurance,
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:21.600]   ask for enjoyment; and when thou hast enjoyment, ask for glory itself, and he shall surely
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:35.960]   give it thee in his own appointed season. Are you on these steps? Having thanked God
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:46.440]   for what you have, have you got this longing for more? Hope, faith, assurance, full assurance,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:46:02.840]   and glory. Ask him for it. Climb the steps. Follow the example of Moses. Venture boldly
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:15.840]   in faith, and say to God, "Show me thy glory." And you have the assurance not only of Spurgeon,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:22.120]   but if you do so from your heart and sincerely, that in his own good season he will answer
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:31.480]   you. You have the infinitely higher and greater assurance of this word of God itself, of the
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:47.520]   promise of the living God. "Draw nigh unto God, and God will draw nigh unto you." Seek
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:59.000]   the glory for yourself. Seek it for the church. Pray for revival, for the passing by of the
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.760]   glory of God. Amen.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.880]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
