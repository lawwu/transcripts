[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.760]   Matt, thanks for being here.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.120]   Absolutely. Thanks for having me on. It took a while for this to come together,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.920]   but I'm glad we're finally able to have this conversation.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.680]   Yeah, well, we were in the middle of trying to decide whether we wanted to make some big energy
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880]   savings and monitoring investments. So I was like, well, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait. And
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.000]   finally it got to the point that I was like, I think with technology evolving and, you know,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.320]   just budgets changing, that's always going to be the case. There's always going to be another thing
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.840]   we all want to add to our homes.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.440]   Oh, absolutely. It's like, this is kind of like,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.400]   when it comes to like smart home monitoring, it's like we're at the very early stages. And it's just
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.320]   like all these different companies are rolling out with all this crazy stuff that you can put
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.800]   in your home right now to monitor your energy, improve your battery usage, solar panels, all
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.360]   that kind of stuff. It's kind of a crazy time right now.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.720]   Yeah. Now you've been doing this for years, but I think if I'm not, if I'm not incorrect,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.400]   you're, you're in the process, or maybe you're even done with a new home where you're completely
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.360]   rethought everything. So I feel like for a lot of us, this happens over time, but for you right now,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040]   you've probably thought about every element all in one short period of time.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.040]   Yeah. I'm actually in my new studio right now, just moved into the house three and a half weeks
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.480]   ago, I think it was. So we just got in, it took about two years to pull this whole house together,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.080]   but yeah, I've, I've thought about every little nook and cranny of this house,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.760]   all the different smart tech I want to put into it, the solar panel, energy storage,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.360]   all that kind of stuff. I thought one of the things you, you really,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.000]   really know well is around the energy and the efficiency of a home. So we'll start there.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.120]   And then I want to jump into all the other home automation, smart home stuff and anything else
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.800]   we didn't cover. So let's just start at the basics. Can you kind of cover what are the
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.080]   principles like first principles of just building a more energy efficient home and why that's
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.560]   important? The first place you start is creating an airtight house. You want a house to be as
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.440]   airtight and well insulated as you can. If you don't, if you don't have a well airtight house,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   it doesn't matter what kind of tech you put into it, what kind of solar panels you put on it.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.880]   If it can't hold onto its heat energy or keep heat out efficiently, your energy use is going to go
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.280]   through the roof. So you have to make sure that you're building it right to make sure that it
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.000]   meets certain standards. And one of those is a passive house. There's a passive house standard
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   that is very popular around the world. It's gaining ground. I did not build my house to
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.760]   passive house certification, but I took a lot of the underlying principles into mind when putting
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.560]   this house together. And I worked with a company that was able to meet kind of close to passive
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.440]   house level airtightness, insulation values to make sure that every watt of energy I spend to
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.120]   heat this house stays in the house as long as I can. And is that something that applies only to
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.240]   new homes or if I'm sitting, which, which right now is about a hundred year old home, is this
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.840]   still something I can aspire to achieve? Oh yeah. You can do this to, you can retrofit old houses
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.040]   and in a lot of areas there's like, you can basically bring in an energy kind of guide.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840]   Usually like in my area, I'm in Massachusetts, there's a program called mass save and it's a
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.440]   free service through the state. And you have a energy person that comes in, evaluates your home
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.560]   and tells you, they'll give you recommendations of what to do. They'll tell you exactly what you
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.360]   have to do to get your house a little more airtight, a little more well insulated to try
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.680]   to achieve these kinds of things. And it's not like some massive, huge, you have to spend a
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.400]   hundred thousand dollars to do it. There's a lot of low hanging fruit that you can really do on a
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.280]   house that's a hundred years old to make it way, way better. Yeah. And I actually got a listener
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.960]   from, or an email from a listener in Arkansas who had a similar program where the state kind of had
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.480]   someone come out, but they also paid for it. So they spent a couple thousand dollars to re-insulate
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.960]   his attic, which blows my mind. He, he told me in the email, he said, I saved about $2,000,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.280]   but I'm not sure if they'll be able to do that for you in California.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.920]   I'd say the same thing here with mass save. It's like, I did it on my old house.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   That house was built in the 1950s and we had somebody come in. They said,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.560]   you need some more insulation and we can blow some insulation in. And they covered,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.120]   I think it was 60% of the cost of doing it all. So at the end of the day, my wife and I, we paid,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.800]   I think it was like four or $5,000. And we got like, you know, $10,000 worth of work done.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.040]   And it made a huge difference after it was done. And it wasn't like a huge expense.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.000]   Is there a thing you would call that program for someone searching? Obviously if it's Massachusetts,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.840]   it's mass save, but you know, is it energy efficiency or what would you
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.880]   search online if someone was in Colorado? That's a good question. I think it would
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.000]   probably be, you'd be searching for something along the lines of energy evaluation, perhaps
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.200]   energy efficiency programs in your area. That's something along those lines.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.760]   So, so that's a big misconception. I think most people think, oh, I got to save money on home,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   home energy usage. Let's buy smart plugs. And it sounds like, no, no, no, let's go old school.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.160]   Let's make sure your home's airtight. So let's go through that. Are there a few,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.680]   even without having someone come out a few places that, that make homes less airtight
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880]   that you can focus on yourselves? Is it windows? Is it insulation in the attic?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.560]   It's windows, doors, and your attic. Cause oftentimes you'll find that there's not
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.840]   enough insulation in your attic. And so it's like, you can have somebody come in just,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.320]   if it's blown in insulation, it's really easy to do that. And it doesn't cost that much money.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.480]   But windows and doors are like the biggest one. Check the air seals on the bottom of your door.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   A good friend of mine who's out in California, he moved into a new house and he showed, he sent
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.280]   me a picture of what it looked like under his door. And he had a gap that was like easily an
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.680]   inch from the bottom of the door to the floor. And it was just sunlight just coming in. And it
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.240]   was just like, if you have gaps like that, just go to home Depot, Lowe's, some like local store
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.760]   and just get some new gaskets that you can put on the bottom of your door seals around it. And
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.960]   you'll be surprised how much of a difference that can make. Okay. What are some of the other big
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.360]   kind of 80, 20 principal things to do to affect your home energy? The biggest use of energy comes
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.600]   from heating and cooling for sure. So if you really want to trim back your energy use, you
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.560]   really should be like, not if it's the middle of summer and you're trying to stay cool and you like
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.280]   it 70 degrees, maybe try 72, maybe try 74. It's like even just one degree of difference can actually
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.120]   make a, like knock your bill down 5%, 10%. So just go a little warmer or a little cooler, depending
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.680]   on what time of year it is and where you live. That makes a huge difference. The other thing you
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.480]   can do, uh, that actually costs no money. If you live in an area, like I know in California,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.240]   you have time of use rates. That's not everywhere, but if you really want to save a lot of money,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.400]   shift how, and when you're spending that money, that energy. So for instance, in California,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.120]   time use rates, super cheap overnight. What you can do is you could like over air condition,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.880]   your house overnight, and then basically turn the system off during the day and let your house
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.240]   gradually come back up to temperature. So you're not using any energy during the day when you're
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.480]   trying to stay cool because you pre-cooled your house overnight. You're basically using
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.800]   your entire house as basically just a giant thermal battery. Um, it's the same thing where
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.120]   I live, like in the middle of winter, I could overheat my house overnight and let it gradually
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   cool over the course of the day during the winter. If I wanted to try to save electricity use with
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.720]   time of use rates. Yeah. And what you're saying, you know, in California, PG&E gives you multiple
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.680]   rate options, right? There's like four or five rate plans where we live and where my sister lives.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.640]   You can choose different time of use rates in a lot of States. It's here's the rate and that's
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:05.120]   what you pay. But just to set some expectations here, it's here's a rate from, and the plan we're
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.240]   on, which is EV2B or something, you know, they have names and there's so many of them from
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:19.520]   midnight until 3pm, we pay the lowest rates. And then from 3pm to midnight, we pay the highest
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.800]   rates. So our goal is like, if we're going to set the, I mean, as inconsequential as this probably
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.960]   is in the grand scheme of things, if we're doing dishes, we set the dishwasher and we just time
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.200]   delay it to run at midnight. Like if we're obviously, if we're charging the car, we charge
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.840]   it after midnight, all the things we can do, we try to push them off to happen before three or
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.200]   after midnight. And so definitely PG&E is really nice. They actually run a, they won't do this
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.800]   proactively, but on the website, you can say, run what my bill would have been for the last year on
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.960]   all the plans and tell me which plan would have been the cheapest. Oh, that is cool.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.720]   And so I will say, if you're going to make a lot of changes, maybe make those changes for a month
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.760]   and run the simulation on last month, because if you're willing to make changes, the plan that
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.680]   makes sense might not be the one that would have made sense before you implemented those changes,
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.600]   but that's a great one. What's the cost difference between the different rates that you're seeing?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:22.240]   So I want to say the cost difference is about 2X on our rate plan. I mean, it's quite expensive.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:30.800]   I'm pulling up the EV2B plan. It is 29 cents from, oh, wow, this is not, oh, I'm not on,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:38.000]   I'm on EV2B. But as an example, there is an EVB plan, which is different. And it's 29 cents from
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   midnight to 7am, 40 cents per kilowatt hour from 7am to 2pm, and then 64 cents from 2 to 9pm.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.320]   So 29 to 64 is the range. But I think we're on EV2, maybe 2A. I can't remember the name of the
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.760]   rate plan we're on, but I just know that ours doesn't have that exact, those exact time windows,
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   unless it's changed, in which case I need to reset how we're using our energy.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.600]   Where I am, I don't have time of reuse rates yet. I heard they're coming. We just don't have them
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.520]   yet. I was actually just out in Vancouver, and I was talking to some people that they
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.760]   have time of use rates up in Vancouver, but the difference is not like what you just described.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.120]   It might be like 12 cents versus nine cents. So it's like a really tiny gap.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.800]   And another great thing, one benefit of an electric car is that the cost of electricity
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.400]   is often cheaper than the cost of gas. Another is that in California, at least,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.000]   you can get on an electric vehicle rate plan for your home. And that peak pricing is a shorter
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.560]   window and a lower price. Okay.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.280]   So like I mentioned, we go from 12 to 3 at 28 cents. And then we have 59 cents from 4 to 9
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.080]   and 48 cents at the other times. We're in the weeds right here. So I'll bring it back. But
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.440]   definitely worth if you are in a state that has different plans, figuring out which ones
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.520]   make the most sense. I'll bring it back. You said heating and air.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   I'm going to go through a few things, my thoughts, because we never had an
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.920]   air conditioner when we moved in. And so we added air conditioning.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.160]   And as we were going through this process, we noticed that there was a lot of inefficiency
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.520]   in our ductwork, like an incredible amount that we had no idea. And so I was talking with a friend
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.600]   of mine, and she was saying... She had someone come in and say, "Wow, your ducts are really
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.000]   inefficient. Everything about your system is bad. We can replace the whole thing for this much."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.040]   And then she called another person. They said, "Well, actually, what we can do is we can seal
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.840]   off all the vents and we can just spray something into your ducts. And it will do
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.160]   90% of what replacing everything would have done for 10% of the cost."
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.720]   So I don't know if you've had any experience with... I don't even remember what they spray
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.360]   into these ducts. But there are a lot of different options for how you modify and build an HVAC
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:58.160]   system. And then I'll just share a few HVAC hacks. And then I want to hear yours, just because I
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.880]   wrote this list. Another one was we have this room I'm in right now gets significantly less
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.480]   airflow than other rooms. And so when it used to be a bedroom, if you wanted someone to sleep here,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.720]   because it's on the ground floor, you'd have to crank the heat up in the rest of the house.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.760]   And so one option is if your ducts are really accessible, you can add a fan in your ducts,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.000]   which will turn on when it senses certain temperature air and blow air to try to help
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.080]   redistribute the air. Or you can get a register fan, which is what we have. So the vent actually
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.120]   has a fan built in. And when it senses cool or hot air based on a desired temperature, it will
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.160]   suck that air in faster to try to help distribute things around the house.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.480]   So that was one big one that we had. And then the other is just we got a lot of quotes. When
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.880]   we added air conditioning, the quotes were like two to three x difference for people doing the
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.760]   same thing. And so I don't know, those are a few of mine. What about what do you think about when
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.480]   you think about an efficient HVAC system? Oh, man, it's the ductwork is a big one.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.000]   My old house, the ductwork head was not sealed well. So all the joints were leaking
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.920]   air. And like, so one side of the house was always hot and the other side of the house
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.080]   was always cold. And we were always trying those hacks of you kind of like semi closed
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.800]   the registers on one side to try to force more pressure to get to the other side of the house.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.200]   But when you do that, you can throw the HVAC system kind of out of balance, which is not
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.320]   good for the system as all. So the idea of the fan is a great one. It's a nice hack.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.480]   I'm going to get into the pricey options really quick when I say this, but it's like
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.720]   heat pump all the things. Yeah. Let's talk about that, because that was a question that we had
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.160]   when we were talking to all these HVAC people about, do we want to do a heat pump?
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:51.200]   And unsophisticatedly came to the conclusion, no. Now feeling like I regret it, but talk about
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.440]   heat pumps. Heat pumps are the most energy efficient way to generate heat or air conditioning,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.680]   hands down. Nothing comes close. It feels like it breaks the laws of physics,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.800]   because like if you're talking about electric resistive heat, it's like for every unit of
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.120]   energy you put in, you get one unit of heat energy out. But with a heat pump,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.720]   it's not generating the heat in that kind of conversion. It's just moving it. So it's taking
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.240]   heat from the air that's outside your house and it's moving it inside the house and using a
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   compressor to amplify it. So for every unit of energy you put into the system, you're getting
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.520]   three or four units of energy of heat back out. And that's the same for air conditioning,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.840]   if you're doing a reverse of that. So heat pumps are just the most efficient thing you can do.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.560]   The downside is they tend to be more expensive upfront. So when you're trying to price it,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.960]   it may look like a little bit of sticker shock of like, oh my God, what am I doing? This is
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.720]   30% more expensive than this other system. That's less efficient. Why would I do that?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.480]   You're talking about timeframes. So it's like, what's that payback period? So heat pumps might
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.320]   take three, five, six years to earn their keep. But then after that point, you're just saving
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.480]   gobs and gobs of energy and money after that point. And would that replace a furnace and an
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.240]   air conditioner unit? Or what does the heat pump replace? It replaces everything. It's like a heat
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.920]   pump. Heat pump goes both ways. In my new house, I have a geothermal heat pump, which is instead of
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.080]   extracting heat from the air, it's extracting heat from deep in the earth. There's a 400 foot well
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:35.360]   that was drilled in my yard. And they basically just ran a pipe, a tube down that 400 feet back
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.400]   up again. And it's got a liquid that goes through it. And it's just, it's like a giant water cooled
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.640]   PC if you know about PCs, but it's like, you're basically just taking, if you want to air
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.560]   condition, you're taking the heat from the inside of the house, you're dumping it into the earth
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.240]   and the earth is cooling down that liquid. So when it comes back up into the house,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.200]   that's being used to cool your house. And then the reverse in winter, if it's like,
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.520]   if I'm trying to get hot air in the house, it's extracting the heat from the earth and bringing
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:06.640]   it in and amplifying it. So it's one system that does both. Okay. And what would, uh,
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.080]   like an upgrade cost be if someone just has a standard house, is this like tens of thousands,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.440]   thousands? That's a loaded question. Cause it depends. Cause there's so many different
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.280]   kinds of heat pumps. You can get air source, heat pumps, which are the cheapest. Um,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.880]   if you want to go super, I don't want to call it cheap, cheap, but like, they're still really good
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.200]   is, uh, like a ductless mini split system. That's probably the most affordable way to get
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.840]   heat pump system into your house with as a retrofit. Um, it's going to still be more
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.720]   expensive than a typical house. So let's say a typical heating system might cost you $10,000
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:45.680]   for an upgrade. This might cost you 14 or 13,000 or something like that. Uh, if you want to flip
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.480]   into what I did, geothermal, uh, your eyes will pop out of your head. The sticker shock, uh, kicks
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.160]   in very fast. Um, cause they can get very expensive because it comes down to the drilling of the well,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   that whole system, that whole side of it is expensive. The mechanicals in my house are
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.080]   not the expensive part. The really expensive part is drilling wells and doing all the stuff you have
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.800]   to do outside to get it to work. But at the end of the day, if you live in a place, you live in
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   Massachusetts, it gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter. You're using your heating and air
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.840]   conditioning quite a bit. Oh yeah. We're using our air conditioning so little that living in the Bay
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.120]   area, we didn't have it for the first 12 years. So like, you know, it's temperate enough that we
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.520]   don't need it that often. The heat also doesn't run that often. So I think if I remember right,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.400]   the reason why we ended up not doing a heat pump was that the less you use your heating and air
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.920]   conditioning, the less, you know, the longer that our return investment will take. Um, and I think
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.280]   for us, it's, it's days a year that we use a heating and air conditioning. So it didn't make
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.720]   that much sense. Yeah. That's, it's something I always tell people when they ask me, should I get
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.000]   solar panels? It's like, I can't answer that for you. You have to figure it out yourself because
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.280]   it's such a personal thing. Like it makes so much sense for me for solar and a geothermal in my
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.280]   current place right now. But like where you live, a heat pump, the expense of that would make no
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.120]   sense. It's a, you live in an area that's very comfortable for large periods of the year and
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.200]   you wouldn't need an air conditioner for a long period of time. It would take you forever to
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.640]   earn your money back on that. So it doesn't make sense in your situation. So yeah, a hundred percent.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.320]   Well, we'll come back to solar, but general other bang for your buck. Uh, I'll throw one
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.960]   out in our last house. So one of the nice things we did, maybe, maybe now's a good time to talk
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.400]   about energy monitoring. Um, we didn't have any sophisticated energy monitoring at my last
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.520]   condo, except that PG&E, the electrical utility company had smart meters. And so you could buy
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.360]   something for relatively inexpensive under a hundred dollars. It would let you get streaming
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.480]   data from PG&E from your smart meter to see how your energy usage was going. And we were like,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.240]   gosh, why are we using so much energy? And so we just kind of went around the house,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.040]   totally unsophisticated. And we like unplugged the fridge, plugged in the fridge. We tried stuff.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.280]   And then we turned off the lights and we, and we saw the electricity in the house drop in half.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.920]   And we had these crazy halogen lights that we're using up. When we turned on the lights,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:17.200]   the energy double or tripled, depending on how many rooms were on. And so we realized just
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.920]   replacing all these lights with LEDs, cut our energy usage in half. Um, now we weren't using
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.560]   a ton of energy because keep in mind Bay area, not using it. We didn't have air conditioning.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.160]   We weren't using a lot of heat, but for us, that was a big one. I don't,
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   is that something that is unique to whatever lights they put in this house? Or is that a big,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.720]   uh, savings option for people? That's a huge savings option for people. I don't think people
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.760]   realize how much money they're spending on lighting. They don't, it's just, you just don't
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.760]   think about it. Uh, and I, it's going to sound like I'm making a horrible pun, but I'm not
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.520]   like with knowledge comes power. Uh, it's like knowing how your energy is being used in your
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.800]   house. Just that alone is massive. Like you talked about that device. It's like one of the first
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.520]   devices I got was called a sense where you installed into electric panel. It costs like,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.080]   I think when I got it, it was a couple hundred bucks and it costs like a hundred dollars to
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.800]   have installed. So I think it was like $300 all in. And then it has, I'll say AI that kind of
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.080]   has hit or miss, but it kind of tries to identify things that it's detecting on your home. So it
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.400]   will say it can figure out, Oh, that's your age prior HVAC system. That's prior air conditioner.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.760]   That's probably your microwave. And it can start to tell you like your current use is this. And it
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.960]   will also tell you an always on category that you're, you're spending 350 Watts constantly.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.320]   It's always running in the background. And when I found that out, I was like, where the hell is
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.720]   that 350 Watts going? Like, what is, what is using all that energy? So I just, the same thing going
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.560]   around my house, turning things off. Like there's a period where I would turn everything off in the
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.400]   house. And I looked at, okay, the house is down to five Watts. I don't know where that five Watts
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.160]   is coming from, but it's five Watts. And then it was like slowly turning things back on to figure
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.480]   out where that energy was coming from. And it was similar to you. It was like, there was some
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.680]   lighting that was running that took more energy than we expected because it wasn't led. Um, there
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   were, uh, there was a dehumidifier at one point that we discovered was kind of running rogue.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.080]   We thought it was on a schedule that was running in our garage, which could get kind of damp. We
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.520]   thought it was only running a few hours a day, but it turned out it was running like 12 hours a day
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.360]   overnight and we were asleep and we didn't know it. And so it was like wasting gobs of electricity.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.160]   So it was like, when you know where the energy use is going in your house, it can be huge and
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.000]   you don't have to spend hundreds. You can get a device called a kilowatt. Um, you can buy them
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.800]   on Amazon for like 25 bucks. And it's basically just like one side's got the prongs, you put it
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   into an outlet and then the other side's gotten, you know, you plug something into it and it will
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.120]   show you exactly how many Watts that thing you plugged in is using. So if you're curious, how
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.360]   much a lamp is using, you can literally plug your lamp into this, plug into the wall, and then you
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.640]   can monitor how much energy it's using over the next 24 hours and then determine, Oh, wow, I could
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.360]   save some money by changing that lamp out or that bulb out. So there's some very affordable ways to
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.600]   track this stuff down. Yeah. When we moved into this house, the previous owner installed a sense
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.800]   system and left it on the downside. You don't get that always on category gives you no data.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.480]   So I don't know where it's coming from, what it's doing, but I could go turn off a lamp and maybe a
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.920]   lamp's not enough to get a good sense of whether it's having a huge impact, but I can certainly
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.520]   turn on all the lights off, turn all the lights on, turn on the furnace, turn off the furnace,
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:27.760]   run the oven. This house for some reason has 2 ovens and a countertop oven. So we have like 3...
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.960]   It's like which oven is actually the most expensive? And I always thought it was one.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.160]   And I was totally wrong. We tested these 2 ovens. 2 of them were electric and we were like, "Wow,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.600]   one of them is actually much more efficient." I haven't gotten to the point to monitor gas usage
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.480]   to tell whether the oven, the gas or the electric oven is cheaper. So that's like a level 2 game
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.920]   that I haven't played. But I was blown away testing a lot of things. Since you've done it,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.280]   I've always heard, "Oh, you leave the TV plugged in, you leave the computer plugged in. Even if
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   they're off, they're still draining energy." While that might be true, is that really where
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.520]   people should focus their time and energy? Or is it really about finding the major things that are
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.880]   causing drain? It's the major things. It's like you want to hit the low-hanging fruit.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.640]   I mentioned my dehumidifier. When we figured that out, it was like, "Wow, we saw our energy use
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.240]   decrease by 20% just by making that one tweak." When you're talking about a television set,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:32.560]   it might be pulling 2, 3 watts. It does matter. But if you have multiple TVs and multiple game
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.640]   consoles and things like that, they're all sucking 2, 3, 5 watts. It does add up.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.360]   But that's not where I would start at all. It's not going to make a huge dent.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.240]   There's diminishing returns. That's when you start to get to that lower tier is around that point.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:56.320]   What about better appliances? Switching from a 20-year-old electric washer/dryer to a new one,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.560]   or refrigerators or dishwashers, is that a huge opportunity to save?
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:08.800]   Yes, 100%. I mentioned heat pump all the things. In our new house, we got a heat pump
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   clothes dryer, which uses way less electricity than our previous dryer did. It's night and day
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:22.960]   how much power this thing uses, way less than half. There's so many different things you can
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.440]   get with it. The Energy Star certificates here in the US, there's usually a yellow sticker on every
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.640]   appliance that gives you an estimate as to how much it will cost you over the course of a year.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.240]   You have to take those with a grain of salt, but at least it's an apples-to-apples comparison
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.760]   between appliances. There's huge differences between refrigerators and washing machines and
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.880]   things that you can get that way. You definitely want to pay attention to those stickers
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.920]   and get the most energy-efficient appliance you can.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.680]   And is there a rule of thumb or just a general principle on gas versus electric? I know it's
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.040]   probably very dependent on where you live and rates, but if someone's out there deciding,
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.720]   "Do I want an electric heat pump or gas dryer?" It sounds like heat pump is probably the way to go,
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.280]   but let's set that aside and go with the two standard, electric or gas dryer.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.080]   How would you think about that decision?
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.520]   That's a tough one because gas tends to be crazy cheap. If you're just looking at dollars,
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.720]   it depends on where you live and what your electricity rates are. Gas may just win hands
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.240]   down, but I would say 99% of the time, it's going to probably be electric. It would end
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.080]   up being your best bet for something like a clothes dryer, even a non-heat pump version.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.680]   Just because they tend to be safer, that's another thing. Gas dryers are
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:47.840]   fire, clothing, lint. It doesn't go well together, but electric tends to be,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.760]   I would say, the better bet depending on which way you're going.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.960]   What about heating? We talked about heating and cooling the house, but what about heating and
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   cooling the water in the house? I guess just heating because I guess we don't really cool our
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:06.560]   water. On that, again, it's the same thing with the gas prices, things like that. Depends on where
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.520]   you live. In my area, going electric, again, heat pump all the things, heat pump, water heaters,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.920]   300% efficient for every unit of energy you put in with what you get out. Stuff like that,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   you can easily save money with an electric system over a gas system, but if you're talking just a
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.360]   plain old electric non-heat pump version, it still might be in your favor to go gas.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:40.800]   But again, safety, you still have toxic fumes that can potentially leak into your house. There's
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.960]   health considerations when you're talking about gas inside your house that you want to take into
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.600]   account. For most of it, I would say it's a heat pump, water heater would definitely be the winner.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.440]   Are those tankless or is this a two-by-two matrix? Because in my mind, it was like you could go with
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.560]   electric tankless or tank and gas, but I guess I never processed that maybe there were two other
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.080]   options. There's other options. They're often called hybrid water heaters. I have a Rheem
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.040]   heat pump water heater. It looks like any water heater you would have seen, just a big old tank,
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.560]   but it seems to have a little hat on top of it. It goes a little taller. That taller portion
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.960]   is the heat pump just sitting on top of the tank. That's all it is. There's a resistant element
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.120]   inside the water heater, just like a regular electric water heater. It's a hybrid mode.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.160]   You can also get heat pump systems that are also natural gas. These hybrid systems can tap into gas
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.240]   or electric with the heat pump hat on top of it. There's a lot of options you can look at.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.040]   They tend to be more expensive than just straight up gas or straight up electric,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.760]   but when you're talking about over the course of 10 years, water heater lasts about 10 years,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.920]   they're going to come out ahead for sure. You still have a tank. Is that right?
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.880]   I still have a 40-gallon tank with that little heat pump hat on top of it. Then to complicate
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.480]   matters for my new house, it's actually tied into my geothermal system for my heating and cooling.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:16.000]   My heating and cooling system, when it's running, a compressor is running, it's generating heat
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.560]   from the compressor itself. What the system does is it captures that waste heat from the HVAC system
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.840]   and pumps that over into what's called a desuperheater tank and basically creates
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:34.000]   free hot water for me. Then that desuperheater tank feeds into a regular water heater tank.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.080]   I actually have two tanks in my mechanical room. One's the desuperheater tank that feeds
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:47.360]   into this heat pump water heater. The combination of the desuperheater, which produces roughly half
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:53.680]   of your hot water needs for free, essentially for free, tied into a heat pump water heater,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.440]   which is 300% efficient, it's like all of that stuff ties in together. The amount of money
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.200]   I'll be spending on my hot water in my house, the estimate is like, no joke, it's like 50 bucks a
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.360]   year or something like that. It's something crazy, crazy low that I may be spending on hot water.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.800]   I think now's a good time to tell everyone, if anyone wants to go a little bit deeper on any
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.720]   one of these topics, I'm pretty sure you have a video on every single one of them on the YouTube
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.160]   channel and then a conversation that ensues on the podcast. I'll just flag that for anyone here
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.760]   that if you're like, "Oh, I want to know more about this heat pump water heater." I'm pretty
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.880]   sure you've made a video about it because I think I watched it. There's a lot more to get there.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.040]   A couple more last things here. I read this thing that the Department of Energy said,
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.760]   which was that if you replace your filters regularly on your air conditioner, it could
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:48.720]   save your energy consumption anywhere from 5% to 15%. Does that seem reasonable? That seems like
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:57.440]   goes in the first step thing, wow, just filters, cut your energy by 5% to 15%. Seems crazy.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   I have not heard that stat. That's new to me, but it makes sense because the older a filter gets,
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.400]   it gets filled up with lint and dust and becomes less efficient. The system has to work harder to
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.040]   move air through it. It does make sense that if you change that frequently, the air is going to
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:18.880]   move more freely, which means less energy use. It makes sense. I could totally see it being the case.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.440]   Are you regularly changing filters? Because I imagine there's got to be at least a decent
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.120]   number of people listening that are like, "I haven't changed my filter in five years."
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   For me, my motivation for change, I have really bad allergies. We change the filters
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.960]   on the set schedule that we're supposed to do. It's like every six months or a year,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.640]   you're supposed to be changing certain filters out. Maybe it's every three to six for others.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.720]   We're always living by that, mainly because of my allergy problems.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.280]   I've been a beneficiary of that savings and I didn't realize it.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.960]   The other hack I have here, and then if you have any other little ones,
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.720]   is that there are a lot of people that leave their water heater too hot.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.440]   And the first time that most people realize this is when you have children and one of the
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.600]   recommendations they have, "Oh, you have kids? Turn down your water heater temp."
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.680]   And I just realized that there are some people that to get to the hottest temperature they ever
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.640]   need, it's 100%. And for some people, it's to get to the hottest temperature, it's like 70%.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.800]   So if your shower and sink and everything go way hotter than you ever need,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.600]   then you're probably spending energy, whether that's electricity or gas, you're spending energy
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.960]   to heat that tank up so much and then not using as much of it as you need, you're probably
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.160]   overspending. So I'd say dial it back until you maybe have gotten too far and then you can bring
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:43.200]   it up. I remember as a kid, when we were leaving for a trip for a week or two, we would dial the
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.440]   hot water heater all the way back to nothing and then turn it back on when we got home.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.160]   And so that was one of the home energy hacks was when you're gone, now you've got away mode on your
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   nest, which makes that easy, but you can also turn back the temperature on your water heater.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.760]   Yeah, that's a really smart recommendation. On top of which, some of these new water heaters,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.800]   like the one I just got from Reem, it has a smart app that you can install to it and check it,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   and it will tell you how many kilowatts you're using on your hot water. So you can gamify it
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.920]   that same way, adjusting the temperature, seeing how it affects the hot water spend you're doing.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   But it also has a vacation mode on it. And I've never seen this on a water heater before,
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.920]   where it's like, I can set a, I'm going on a trip for two weeks. I could do exactly what you're
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.520]   talking about, put it into vacation mode and it dials the temperature way back to save you energy.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.080]   It's the stuff is getting kind of crazy. Is there, have you noticed, is there any way to monitor,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.160]   like smart monitoring, like sense or something like that for gas? I have not come across one.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.080]   Honestly, it's like I've, everything I've come across is like, I've found add-ons you can put
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.760]   onto water heaters so that you can monitor your water. Like I had a gas water heater and it could
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.320]   tell me how much gas I was using on that water heater. But I've never seen one that you could
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.480]   add to see how much your whole house is using and where it's going and all that kind of stuff. I've
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.640]   never seen that. I wish there was one. That'd be, that'd be nice. I have seen on water, there's a
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.000]   flume is one device that my brother-in-law has that just monitors how much water is using,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.280]   which in his case, there was a leak in there somewhere and he got alerted to it and it was
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:20.560]   cost, you know, it would have cost hundreds of dollars and, and he got an alert and he figured
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.000]   it out quickly. So sometimes those systems are great as well. Yeah. I've been, I've been using,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.080]   I used a fin. It's, it's just like the flume. There's a fin in my old house. I'm going to
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.840]   have a fin in my new house as well. It hasn't been installed yet, but it's fantastic to be
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.680]   able to know exactly how much water you're using. And it can detect even just like a slow drip
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.000]   that's coming from something in your house and alert you to that. It's, it can be,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.840]   it can save you a lot of money. Yeah. And I think we'd be remiss if we talked about all this
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.520]   monitoring. One of the things we originally connected on that was one of the things we
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.720]   were considering installing was a span, which is like, if you want to take sense to the next level,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:00.880]   you can replace your entire, um, what is it? Why, why am I playing on the name? Yeah. Your,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.400]   your circuit panel, you can replace the whole thing and get a per circuit level monitoring,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:13.040]   which I think you've done. Um, is that really just like the creme de la creme of home energy
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:19.440]   monitoring? It is the argument of if it's necessary or not comes up a lot because it
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.920]   is a costly venture to put one of these things in. But where the, like we talked about the sense,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:30.240]   it gives you the information, but it's up to you to really make the decisions or to track
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:37.040]   things down where when you have per circuit monitoring, um, it's not just more granular,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.400]   but you can also set up automations and turn specific circuits on and off, depending on what's
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.520]   going on in your home, where, so the, the, these kind of electric panels that are smart can actually
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.400]   take it to the next step and be proactive in how they're reacting to what's going on in your house,
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.320]   where the sense is just information that you're getting. Yeah. I mean, it was really interesting
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.120]   to see, and this dovetails nicely to where I want to go that if, you know, we have solar and we have
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.000]   a battery, if all of a sudden you lose power sense would automatically go in and say, Oh,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.680]   let's turn these things off to make your battery last as not sense. Sorry. Span would go in span,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.160]   would go in and say, let's turn all these things off to make sure your battery and your solar can
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:23.440]   get you as far as possible. Um, and you know, right now, little things like I need to the circuit
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.600]   breaker flip that I can go change it, or I want to turn something off remotely and fix it and turn
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.560]   it back on. Uh, I just want someone to come and actually label them, uh, our hundred year old
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.880]   house, these circuit break, these circuits are so mislabeled that I actually have no idea what about
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.840]   half of them are. And we've tried going around the house to figure out what they are. And I have no
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.840]   idea. So if there is a service where someone will just come out and figure out what they are,
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.920]   I would love it. Have you done that thing where one person's in the room and the other person's
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.960]   at the panel and you're like yelling at each other or talking over the phone of like, okay,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.080]   I turned it off. Did it go off? No. Okay. Try a different one. And we even bought this thing that
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.400]   you like plug into the, us an outlet and you just run this thing along the sort of wall and it'll
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.040]   beep when it's there, but it's, it's not very accurate. Uh, and so we have some ways to go,
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:19.600]   but that dovetails nicely. So one way to save money on energy is to reduce your usage. Um,
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.400]   we talked briefly. Another one is to dial in your rate plan to match your usage,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.040]   but a whole nother one is to just produce your own energy. So let's, I moved into a
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.360]   home with solar, so I didn't have to make a decision, but you've had to make that decision.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:39.840]   So how do you think about when it makes sense to kind of produce your own energy? Uh, you know,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.960]   maybe, maybe there's another option. I remember there was this one house in San Francisco that
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.800]   had a wind turbine on the roof. Uh, but, but how do you think about solar as an option and when
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.360]   it makes sense? Yeah, I've done this twice. Now I did it on my old house and I've done it on this
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.040]   house. Uh, the solar just got installed a week and a half ago. I'm a new house. It's still not
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.760]   turned on yet, but the way I look at it is you have to have a clear set of goals that you want
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.920]   to do. Like, what are your goals? Are you just looking to save money on your energy bill and
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.640]   come out ahead? Are you concerned about climate change? Whatever. Are you looking for energy
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.360]   security? Because power goes out in your neighborhood several times a year because
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.480]   there's big storms that come through and knock down power lines. What is it that you're trying to,
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:27.280]   um, solve for? And once you have that criteria, it becomes very easy to decide if solar is right
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.800]   for you or not. And it's kind of what I said earlier of like, I can't say everybody should
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.760]   go solar because it may not fit your goals. So for like me and my personal situation,
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.840]   it was, I was looking for energy security and to save some money over the long term.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.360]   So it's like, I wasn't looking for a short term goal for saving money. But in my areas where I
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.520]   live here in Massachusetts, we get, you know, ice storms that come through bad storms in the
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:55.680]   winter that sometimes knock out my power lines. Um, my old house, I, we still, you know, we haven't
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.360]   had the closing yet in the old house, but I still have the span in my old house. And I got a
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.680]   notification yesterday because it was a hurricane Lee just came up the East coast of the United
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.960]   States and took out power for where my old house is. And I got the notification from span saying,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.000]   Hey, your house, your house is on, um, backup right now. Here's how long it will last given
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.920]   its current use. And since there's nobody there, it was like, it'll last for two and a half days.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.720]   So it didn't really matter, but it was, it's you want to get solar. If those are your goals. Um,
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.280]   and it's really easy to kind of calculate what size of system you need to do, uh, based on those
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.640]   goals, how much you want to save. Um, you can just dial it in based on your, your, your budget,
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.040]   what you're, what, how much energy you're trying to knock down. It's pretty easy to figure it out.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.640]   Once you've got those goals, listen up, can financing be a good option to defer that cost
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.680]   or, or kind of make the ROI happen earlier? Or is, is it feel, I never really understood whether
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.800]   solar financing was like predatory or helpful. It is predatory. If you're talking about, there's
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.080]   like basically three main ways you're paying for cash, you're getting a loan, or you're doing some
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.280]   kind of lease. And it's when you get into the lease territory where it becomes very predatory.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.080]   Um, and it really depends on what business you're talking to and what they're trying to push. I,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   I do not recommend leases at all because what ends up happening is they put a lien in your home.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.080]   If you need to sell your house and move away, you have to figure that out. You're either going to
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.360]   have to have the solar pay to have the solar panels removed. If the new owner doesn't want
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.080]   them or the new owner has to basically take that lease over from you. And a lot of new,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.480]   not a lot of buyers that are buying a house don't necessarily want to do that. So it can kind of put
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:39.680]   you into a very bad position. But if you have a loan or a paid cash, you, it doesn't have that
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.920]   same onus on you. It's like, if you have a loan, when you go to sell your house, you can use the
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.840]   proceeds from the sale of the house to pay off the loan so that the new homeowner doesn't have
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.040]   to do anything when they come in. Um, so those are the ways I would recommend doing it. But
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:59.520]   the fastest way for payoff is with cash, which of course, very expensive, hard to do. So you can,
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.960]   there's a lot of loans out there that have very low interest rates. A lot of States across the
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:08.320]   country have programs that can help you find extremely low interest rate loans to help you
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:14.240]   cover the costs. So there are ways to find very good financing for it. Yeah. And we mentioned
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.200]   earlier some of the programs that will come in and evaluate your home. There are also a ton of,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:25.760]   uh, rebates and incentives for lower cost appliances in certain counties in California.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:32.080]   You can get, I think we got our ratio, which is like a water irrigation system. It was free from
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:37.200]   the County based on, uh, the fact that it helps your home. So I'll just replug that. Make sure
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.920]   you go look at your utility site, your County site, and see what programs there are. Cause
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.680]   there's a lot of stuff, whether it's low interest loans or devices or discounts that you can get.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   How did you, how did you like that, uh, device? How did it work out for you?
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.400]   So we have like a drip irrigation system and we just replaced the,
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.120]   whatever that company is that everyone seems to have rain something, uh, with ratio. And
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.360]   it's really nice. You can walk around the yard, especially when you're trying to test something
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.360]   and you just kind of open the app and say, run zone four. And then you go back, Oh, that's why
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.080]   there's water on our patio in the morning. It's right here. Um, I think similar, I don't think
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.960]   it's functionally that different, but, uh, you know, when we were talking to someone who was
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.520]   helping put in a couple of trees, cause some died, uh, we were able to figure out, okay, well,
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.600]   let's run this. Let's see if it's getting too much. Let's dial it back to 10, 10 minutes instead
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.800]   of 15 minutes. And it was just a lot easier than, you know, going to a machine and like turning a
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.320]   dial on how often it runs on each zone. Uh, so I thought it was great. You know, I wouldn't say
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.680]   it's changed our lives. I think a lot of the smart home stuff, which we're we'll get to the
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.160]   benefits of it, uh, you know, are that you don't have to think about it as opposed to something
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.960]   you use every day. Right. Yeah. I was asking cause it's like, that's, I've heard that's a good way
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.000]   to save on water usage. So it makes sense that they'd be offering it to you for free. Cause it
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.320]   can really help cut down on how much water is getting used, especially in an area where water
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.960]   might be a very scarce thing. Yep. It's especially good because it's like, Oh, it rained. We're not
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.840]   going to run irrigation. Um, and that, that I think is the big feature that the city loves is
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.320]   you're not going to be using water, uh, when there's rain, which a system that was based
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.720]   off dials would obviously just not have any knowledge of the rain and it would just keep
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.280]   running. Yeah. I mean, to add on that really quick, it's like your, your call out to talking
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.040]   to utilities. It's like when I was just in Vancouver, uh, the utility up there, they give
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.480]   you a device that's like that sense energy monitor for free. Uh, and when you log into your utility
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.960]   account, it shows you live monitoring. It shows you how it's breaking down all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.280]   It's like this stuff doesn't just benefit you. It benefits the utility, which is why a lot of
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.760]   these places are offering these systems for free. Yeah. And when it comes to solar to come back
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.400]   there, there are government tax credits that you get, uh, and a lot of things. I'm not an
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.160]   expert there. Cause we didn't have, you might be, you went through the process, but we already had
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.000]   it when we moved in. So we didn't have to think about it. Yeah. Well, it depends on where you
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.720]   live, but like here in Massachusetts, like California is of course sun country. It's like,
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.960]   you guys had the best programs for years. Massachusetts is actually like not that far
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.200]   behind California as far as what the incentives were. So there's some decent incentives that you
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.440]   can get that knock off the cost of what the system will be out of pocket. And then there's
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.320]   the federal tax rebate that you can get, which knocks 30% off your, uh, how much you owe on your
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.160]   taxes that you can claim. So when you're talking about, like, if you're installing a system,
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.360]   that's $30,000, you're knocking $10,000 right off the bat because the federal tax credit.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.840]   And then my state knocks, you know, another 7,000 off of that. So before you know it,
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.480]   the cost of the system just got way more affordable. So that loan we talked about
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.440]   is much smaller at the end of the day. So it's, it's, there's a lot of beneficial programs out
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.320]   there, but it's, it varies state to state. Some States offer nothing like absolutely nothing.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.560]   So it really depends on where you live. Did you pair, I I'm assuming you did
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.600]   your solar system with a battery. Yeah. Yeah. I'm personally a believer in solar
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.000]   and batteries are like, it's peanut butter and chocolate. They kind of,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.760]   they go together so well, you kind of have them both.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:11.440]   Yeah. Yeah. We have a Tesla power wall and you know, it's great. You know, power goes off,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:17.280]   you're protected, but it's also great because you can collect energy when it,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.520]   even if you don't collect it from the sun, you can collect it during off peak hours.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:28.000]   And so for us, if you look at, we have these three different prices, we never pay for anything other
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.360]   than the lowest price because we've either we're either producing it from solar or we've stored it
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:40.160]   on the battery. Now at 1159 PM is the battery drained enough that if something were to happen
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.720]   and the power went out, we would, we would be, you know, we wouldn't have a full battery. Yes.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:49.200]   It's kind of a risk, I guess we're willing to take, but the battery is really helpful to shave
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.680]   that peak cost off. But do you have power going out that much?
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.120]   No, no, we don't have power, but there are a lot of places where, you know,
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.520]   that's the risk is if your power goes out and your battery is low because you were using it
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.200]   to kind of collect cheaper energy, that would be the problem. And
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.840]   to fix that, I guess you could have two batteries or just not worry about it.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.120]   Or in the case of the Tesla, cause I had a Tesla power wall, my old house,
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.800]   they have the, um, when a weather alert comes out, the system automatically charges itself up.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.920]   So it's like, if you had time of use rates and there was a weather alert, it would,
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.080]   the weather alert would override the time of use rates to make sure that you have enough
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.000]   power for that power outage that might happen because of big storms coming in.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.920]   And how do you generally think about that? You've got Tesla power walls, Tesla solar roofs.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.080]   Um, but what do you think you, it sounds like you don't have either of those in this new house.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.280]   No, I went, I went with a different brand. Uh, we went with, um,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.400]   Enphase, which is a major solar company. They have their own battery system.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.680]   We had an Enphase solar at the old house with a Tesla power wall.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.120]   This house is Enphase solar with an Enphase, uh, battery system.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:01.280]   And part of the reason I did that and not solar Tesla, uh, power wall was, uh, because of the
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.240]   integration between the battery system and the solar system, the way they integrate with each
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.680]   other is, is pretty cool and very sophisticated. So I wanted to go that route. Um, it also meant
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.920]   that we didn't need to get as much battery as we might need to otherwise, because kind of tying
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.440]   back to the span, there's all these benefits that you can get where if you have smart energy
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.880]   monitoring that can control how energy is being used and when, and then these smart systems between
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.720]   the solar and the battery, the way they work, it doesn't mean that you need 40 kilowatt hours of
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.680]   storage. You might only need 20 because it's very smart and intelligent about how it uses the energy
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.520]   storage, which saves you money. So it's like you spend more on the, you may be spending $7,000
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.320]   or something on the span panel, but you're saving $15,000 because you don't need as many batteries.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.360]   Yeah. Or the way I'm thinking about this now is I have a friend who is thinking about getting
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:56.320]   solar right now. And he was telling me how many, how much solar he needed. And I was like, Whoa,
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.280]   now I'm thinking before you go through the process of solar or batteries, go through everything we
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.120]   talked about before, whether you want to upgrade your heating system, whether you want to start
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.440]   replacing your light bulbs, like go through the process to dial in how much energy your home
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:16.000]   needs and bring that down as much before you jump into the process of how many panels do I need? Or
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.240]   how big of a battery do I need to support the house? Yeah, you nailed it. It's like, I've had
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.680]   people come to me and say, Hey man, I'm looking to get this solar panel system. And it's like,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.080]   they show me like they live in a large house and they share the plan with me. And it's something
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.320]   like, you know, a 30 kilowatt solar panel system is like, that is bonkers huge. And it's like,
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.480]   well, how much energy are you using? It's like, well, we have two EVs and we have all this stuff.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.120]   It's like, well, you know, if you replaced all this stuff, you could probably cut your
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.720]   energy use down by 30%, which means you need a smaller solar panel system. You absolutely are
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:52.240]   right. You need to start with trying to figure out exactly how much you can reduce your energy use.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.760]   And then that's the number you're trying to achieve. Is there anything on the horizon or
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.360]   stuff that's come out really recently that's worth bringing up? Cause you're, you know,
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:05.040]   I used to stay on top of tech stuff, but not energy stuff. Is there like some new technology
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   or product or something that you're really excited about in the next few years? Oh, there's a,
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.880]   there's a few really cool things. Um, one of which is going back to water heaters.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.240]   There's something called phase change materials that are basically thermal batteries. You put
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.720]   energy into it. It changes the material. Think about like water goes through a phase change when
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.480]   it goes, turns into steam. So you have a phase change material, like it's like a wax. So it's
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.160]   kind of like a solid, and then it becomes kind of like this soft liquid material. So there's these,
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.120]   it almost looks like the size of a, um, instant water heater. It's a small little box and it's
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.520]   made by a company called sun amp. And you pass, you basically have an electric resistive heater
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.200]   inside of it that charges the battery. And then when you need hot water, cold water just passes
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:52.000]   through some tubes, the phase change material and heats up, you got hot water and it's crazy
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.160]   efficient. And that's just hitting the U S market. Now it's been in Europe, but it's just hitting
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:03.120]   the market here. Now. Um, another one is a new battery tech that's going to make home batteries
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.600]   cheaper and last longer. Uh, there's something called a flow battery. There's a company that's
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.200]   trying to bring this flow battery to market. That would be about the size of a small refrigerator
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.360]   that you could just drop off the back of your house. It's 40 kilowatt hours of storage. And
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.720]   it would be price competitive to like, I think they said a single power wall and it's got
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.520]   dramatically more storage and a flow battery can last you decades. So it's like you would,
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.560]   you'd never have to change this battery. You'd buy it and it would work for you for the next 20,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.640]   30 years where a power wall is going to probably hit end of life after a decade
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.160]   or need to be swapped out. I've also heard that one of the cheapest home batteries out there
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.640]   is the Ford F one 50 lightning. You can power your house off that thing for like a week or
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.800]   something ridiculous because the battery pack is so big. Well, someone did a comparison. They said
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:55.040]   to get the battery capacity of the Ford F one 50 in Tesla power walls, you'd spend more than you
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:01.600]   would. So it's like, but with the Ford F one 50, you also get a truck. Like you get more battery
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:08.400]   charging for a less cost and a truck. And I have at least one friend who I'm in this group of kind
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.960]   of nerdy tech dads. And he was like, I think I'm just going to buy a truck. He lives in a place
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.600]   where having an extra car is not a hassle. And yes, you got to register it and insure it and
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:23.760]   all that kind of stuff. But you know, so he was like, I get a car and the batteries and it ended
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.520]   up being a much better deal than adding on more power walls. That's another piece of tech that
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:31.280]   I'm excited about. It's vehicle, it's called vehicle to grade or vehicle to load. It's like
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.720]   when you have an EV that has bi-directional charging. So when you plug it in, it can take
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:42.080]   power, but it can also give power. It's like my, my Tesla model three that I've got, it's the
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.240]   largest battery I have in my house. It's like a 60 something kilowatt hour battery. It's like,
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.960]   if I could plug that into my house, I may not need a battery system like a power wall or an
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:56.880]   in phase battery because you have so much in your car right there as a multi Tesla own owning family.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.960]   Do you think that's something that can come to these cars without modification or
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.240]   is it going to take a lot? That's a really good question. I have no idea if when it comes to
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.560]   Tesla specifically, they're like the one company, they're the elephant in the room when it comes to
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.240]   vehicle to grid. It's like every other EV company is starting to roll this stuff out.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.560]   They're the ones that are like basically not doing it. And part of the reason for that,
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.080]   I think it's because they have the power wall and they don't want to eat into that,
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:27.760]   that market. But at some point they'll do it. I have a feeling it's going to require a
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.520]   hardware change. So if you have an older Tesla, it may not be able to do this.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.360]   But on the, on the, on this note, the new iPhone 15s that have come out with USB-C ports now allow
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.520]   you to use your phone to charge your AirPods. So, um, they, you know, Apple, Apple is, uh,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:50.000]   is doing this, uh, already also. Um, and speaking of Apple and, and technology and stuff,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.560]   let's move a little bit home energy savings. We talked about saving energy. We talked about
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:00.240]   producing your own with, with an end goal of both security, but also hopefully some savings.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.920]   Uh, the next big category that I know you thought a lot about in your home,
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   that is kind of the opposite. It's usually where you end up spending more money than saving money
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:13.040]   is all around smart home and home automation. And I've gone down a lot of rabbit holes here
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.560]   in the past few years. And I'm curious how you just broadly thought about a strategy because
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:24.320]   I've pieced mine together over time, but you just have a new home and you probably got the chance
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.840]   to think about every decision from the beginning. How did you do that?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.720]   Yeah, I was in the same boat in my old house. It was such a piecemeal patchwork of insanity
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:37.280]   that it was so easy to break. So when I was building this house, it was, what is my favorite?
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:42.160]   What are the things I'm trying to do? And what is the tech that will work together the best?
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.400]   And thankfully in the smart home market right now, there's a new system called matter,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.520]   which is kind of this broadly used system across all like Google, Apple, Amazon,
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.560]   everybody's bought into it. So if you buy new smart home tech that is matter certified,
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.680]   it will work with pretty much any system. It works locally. It's going to be very secure.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.520]   So it's like, if you're a privacy centric person that only wants locally controlled smart home
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:11.440]   tech matter devices can do that for you. Uh, if you, if you want to jump between Apple home kit
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:17.120]   or Google home or Amazon, it's like these devices will interoperate. That's one of the, been one of
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:22.080]   the biggest problems up to this point. So for my new house, I was thinking along those lines of,
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.680]   I only want to get products that are really locally controlled or matter certified and kind
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.560]   of future-proofed and we'll work together. Uh, but I also wanted to make sure I was only getting
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.720]   things that had a purpose. Like, I'm not a big fan of like, Oh, I have a smart light. They can
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.360]   turn red and green just because it can. It's like that kind of stuff is like, not what I was
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:46.160]   concerned with. It was more about smart light switches that can turn rooms off if nobody's
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.240]   there for a certain period of time, stuff like that. Okay. And what is that light switch? Cause
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:55.040]   I have, I, we, the things we did here, maybe I'll share what we did when we moved into this house,
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.360]   we replaced all the light switches with Lutron cassette lights, which at the time seemed like
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.480]   the best lighting automation system certainly doesn't sense what's happening anywhere.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.200]   So that was one big change we made. And fortunately, the previous homeowner had
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:18.560]   done a lot of hardwiring. So we ran, we have, uh, a ubiquity Unifi Wi-Fi system and, and including
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:25.200]   Unifi cameras that are mostly run hardwired. Those are the 2 big pieces, but I'm curious,
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.520]   um, you know, from your side, what were the components that you thought were actually useful
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.640]   and important in your system? Well, the first one was lighting and we went with Lutron for
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:41.760]   the new house. Lutron is the only smart home device I've ever used that has been rock solid,
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.240]   never had a problem, never failed me in any way, shape, or form. It works with every system that's
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.440]   out there. It is like the cream of the crop as far as I'm concerned. So when I moved in here,
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:56.880]   I got all the Lutron cassette for all the switches and then since because it ties into any system,
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:02.000]   then I can basically automate things. I'm using Apple home as my base, but I may actually be
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   shifting that. But it's like, I can set up automations for all this kind of stuff of,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.120]   if nobody's home, lights go off. If it's this time of night, certain lights go off. If it's,
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.280]   you know, room is empty for a certain period of time, lights can go off. So it allows me to set
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.840]   up those automations in a rock solid way that just always works. And that was the first place I
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.240]   started. Great. I feel great about my decision to do that because we have the same system.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.760]   What about other, I've got ubiquity unify stuff everywhere too. Cause it's like, again,
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:34.560]   it's kind of like the cream of the crop when you're talking about security cameras, wifi,
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.760]   setting up home networks, it really is the best. It's, it's, it's the first time I've used it and
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.960]   I love it. Yeah. I can't think of the number of times in our last home, I had to restart a router.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:50.720]   I think the advantage of unify system is I have not restarted our router in over a year.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.000]   Yep. It might restart at night when no, one's actively using it to upgrade the software. Maybe
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.680]   that's happening, but it is so solid that I just haven't had to do any restarting or anything.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.560]   It's not the most consumer friendly to set up. And I think they're getting better there, but
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:13.360]   you know, that's been solid. And then, you know, almost every home internet plan is now unlimited.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:18.320]   So it doesn't really matter, but it is nice that, you know, all the cameras are local.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.520]   So, you know, we've just got a massive hard drive in the, in our kind of what's called a
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.360]   dream machine pro similar, probably to what you have, and you could still stream your cameras
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.800]   from anywhere, but you're not constantly using your bandwidth to stream, you know,
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:37.760]   nine cameras to the cloud, uh, and, and storing them on someone else's server,
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.640]   which just eats into your, you know, bandwidth use.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.200]   And on top of which is recording all the time. So it's like these wifi cameras can get super cheap.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.400]   It's like, you may miss the first 30 seconds of a motion event that was recorded because it took a
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.480]   while for the camera to realize something was happening before it recorded it, where the
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.280]   ubiquity stuff is just recording all the time. So it's like, if you need to scroll back two minutes
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:05.120]   before an event, you can see exactly what's going on. It's, it's definitely, I feel like I've been
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:09.920]   bought into the top tier kind of stuff. Um, and if you have rogue devices that are using a lot
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:15.360]   of bandwidth, that's another thing I noticed is that the dream machine shows you per client.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:19.600]   So it shows how much bandwidth each thing is using. So if you're trying to track down, like,
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.080]   why is it like, why is my bandwidth is so high? Oh, there's this one computer that I forgot was
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:27.920]   on and it's doing something crazy in the background. You can track that kind of stuff down too.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:33.200]   Yeah. The analytics are really interesting. I, I, you could nerd out about it. And,
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:37.920]   and I certainly have, I don't know if you have to, uh, what other platforms are you using?
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:44.560]   Are you doing things for locks? Yeah, I have a Schlage, uh, smart door locks that tie into my
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.960]   Apple home kit system. Um, I use Apple watches, so it's like, we can just walk up to the door,
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:53.120]   put our watch to the door and the door opens super nice to have. I was like, I don't like
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:58.160]   carrying keys anymore and this makes it super easy. Um, but yeah, it's, it's like I said,
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.640]   we're kind of focused on Apple home cause we're Apple, we're Apple household, but I'm looking at
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:08.960]   other systems. Like there's a home assistant, which is kind of a super geeky, nerdy, uh, free
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.520]   open source system that you can get that I've been playing with, not user-friendly compared to
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.320]   something like Apple. Uh, but it's very, very powerful and can do whatever you want. Um, and
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.120]   there's other systems coming online. Like there's a one called homey from Europe that's just hitting
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:30.640]   the U S market now that is crazy, like powerful and really easy to use. Like it is, has a user
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.640]   interface that is fantastic. So it's like, it's great to see options like that hit in the market.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:41.840]   My biggest piece of advice to anyone listening that likes to kind of nerd out is don't make,
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.560]   unless you're a hundred percent sure, don't make your home smart home and security system,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:52.240]   everything DIY. Cause it's fun because I feel like I did this in our last home and we bought
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:58.640]   this device called connected and we used all of the legacy security system, hardwired things,
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:05.280]   brought it online, tied it into smart things. And we had like basically a DIY home security system
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.400]   that tied into this third party that would monitor it.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:12.960]   But it was all like, just, you know, with your home security system, do you really want it to
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:18.160]   all be DIY and based off some scripts that you wrote about what to do? And I thought it was so
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.440]   cool because it would allow you to pre-program something for your Sonos speakers to say if
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.800]   someone broke in and all this stuff. But at the end of the day, I just didn't really trust that
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.440]   it was actually going to work because I had put it all together myself. And we switched to Ring
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:38.800]   and we're using Ring for home security. Very happy. But I hate that we have one platform
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:44.560]   for security, a different platform for locks, a different platform for cameras.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:49.200]   And my question is, should I just get over that and accept that if they all tie in to the same
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.600]   platform, it doesn't really matter if your light switches out and your plugs and your
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:58.000]   door locks are all different? I would say, yeah, you need to get over a little bit
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.160]   in the short term. But in the long term, when the thing I mentioned about matter,
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.360]   that is going to slowly become the industry standard across everything. So at some point,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:14.640]   you'll be able to get some kind of security system like a Ring system that will as a paid service,
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.880]   that you're getting kind of like that monitored for you kind of thing. And it will just work with
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:24.480]   everything, can work with multiple platforms at once. But yeah, you kind of have to get over it
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.840]   as long as it all ties into one central place. That's the most important thing.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.120]   So it's like if you're a Google user and you want it to all go into Google so that on your phone,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.720]   it's all in one location, like all your cameras show up here, all your security stuff shows up
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.120]   in the app, even if it's Ring doing the security side, that's ultimately what's going to make it
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.080]   more user-friendly. And I'd call out for me the wife acceptance factor, the WAF. It's like doing
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.240]   the DIY stuff is fun because I'm a geek. I like to nerd out and do that stuff. But I had set up
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.920]   stuff on my old house that if something broke, my wife could never fix it. She would not know
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   where to start. And so it was all on me to fix it, which is the stuff I'm trying to avoid in this
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.080]   house. I'm trying to get it set up in a way that she would be comfortable going in there and messing
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.800]   with automations and in a user interface that's really easy to understand and use. So it's like
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.160]   you have to think about the other people in your house as well. So otherwise, you're going to run
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.880]   into problems. Yeah, there's one company that I thought was really interesting that we didn't end
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.240]   up using because we'd already wired all these cameras. I don't know. I don't know if you've
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:34.000]   seen Deep Sentinel. So Deep Sentinel is a security platform that the friends I know that have used it
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.160]   love it. And it's similar to a home security system with cameras, except they have people
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:46.000]   that are live monitoring the cameras. So someone walks up to your porch to take a package and
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.920]   someone says... Someone on the speaker is live scene motion and talking to the person without
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:58.400]   you there. So it's almost like as if you have a remote security manager. You see all these movies
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.800]   where like in some rich person's house, there's a room where a guy sits with all the cameras and
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.560]   is ready to go. It's that except that person's monitoring probably hundreds of homes from one
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.800]   chair somewhere else. And so it's actually not just monitored like police station will come,
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.280]   but person will be watching the cameras and be able to proactively do things, whether it's talk
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.320]   or call the authorities or something like that. Wow. That's kind of neat. And there's also a
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.680]   little bit of a creepy factor to it to know that somebody is watching my cameras. There's something
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.920]   a little odd about that, but it's also pretty. Yeah, I think if they ever plug in like that
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.560]   service, if it could plug into an existing set of cameras would be more interesting than buying a
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.760]   whole set of new cameras for the home for all this stuff. Have you have you done a lot of with smart
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.760]   home sensors just around the house to monitor different things, whether it's temperature,
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.160]   humidity leaks, that kind of stuff? Oh, yeah. Like like in this house,
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.880]   the air is my air. The house is so airtight that it needs something called an energy recovery
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.600]   ventilator. That's always bringing in fresh outside air and exhausting stale inside air.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.720]   And as the two pass, it's recovering the heat between them. So it keeps the energy inside the
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.040]   house, but it's giving you constant fresh air. A concern with a system like that is
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.680]   humidity levels might get too high or CO2 levels might get kind of high. So I've got sensors all
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.840]   over this house that are just monitoring temperature, humidity and CO2 and particulate
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.680]   matter, all that kind of stuff. And I'm setting up automations in my house so that if CO2 levels
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.360]   get too high, the ERV will just ramp up a little bit just to make sure that air is changing as it
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.240]   needs to. So there's I definitely am in the sensor game. I'm just I've got them all over the place
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.640]   and sensors for like if a door is open or closed. I'm like I kind of freaked out the electricians
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.160]   that were here the other day because they went to open the door to the mechanical room. They'd
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.440]   opened the door and the light was on and they were like, that's weird. And they closed it and they
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.240]   noticed under the gap of the door, the light went off. And then they stood there for a few
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.840]   minutes to open the door, closing the door, open the door, closing there. And they didn't understand
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.200]   what was going on. And I came around the corner and they were like, did you do something here?
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.720]   And I was like, yeah, there's a door sensor. If you see over there, there's a little door sensor.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.640]   It's acting like a refrigerator. So it's like the light comes automatically because the room's a
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.520]   dark cave. You have to turn the light on. So why not just automate it with a sensor?
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.360]   And what did that automation was that in Apple's home product?
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.640]   Yeah, I bought a matter certified door sensor. That's just this little door sensor that uses
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.760]   something called Thread as its network. And it's linked it directly into home in the home app.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.000]   And then I just set up an automation that said, if door open, turn light on, if doors close,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.360]   turn light off. Super interesting. I have a room that needs this like a dark room that every time
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.760]   and the light switch is so poorly located that you have to like reach around stuff. So
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.280]   that's next on the list. But then I'm like, gosh, couldn't we just use the ring sensors that we have
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.920]   on all these doors already? But I think ring is is kind of private in that way. Did you do anything
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:00.320]   for security in your house? Not yet. Because I'm Apple, I'm looking at a system called Abode,
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.680]   which is similar to ring, but it ties directly into Apple HomeKit. So it's like any sensors I
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.640]   would add could then show up in Apple Home and I could use them for different automations.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.400]   So that's part of the reason I'm looking at that system.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.040]   Any other smart home things I'm forgetting that you've thought about in this new house?
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:24.080]   I'm doing Lutron Serena shades throughout my house. And so it's the same thing. It's like
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.320]   the cost of the shades will never return on investment. So don't take this with a grain
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.920]   of salt. But I am going to be using these shades with some automations to help
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:39.120]   reduce energy costs because sun beaming in your house, if you're trying to keep it cool,
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.360]   warms the room. So it's like I'm going to be setting up automations based on light level
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.880]   time of day, stuff like that, temperature of the room where it could automatically drop
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.680]   the shades halfway if it's close to sunset to keep a room from getting too hot.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.320]   I'll be doing stuff like that. Yeah, we bought Bali blinds
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:03.040]   through Costco and they're kind of like a DIY setup. And I can't explain why,
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.360]   but like one of them just never works and it's never the same one. It always like.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.760]   So I can't say I support the system, but I think it was probably a third of the cost
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:18.160]   of the Serena shades. So like if you're okay that maybe one shade doesn't work sometimes,
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:23.040]   it could be a good way to save. But I will say that we have it on automations right now.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.240]   We're on Google Home and it'll just drop the shades in the morning. I think you can even
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.040]   time shift it from sunrise and sunset so you don't have to kind of constantly change the schedule,
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.760]   raise the shades on one side of the house, drop the shades on the other.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:41.280]   It's not quite smart enough to know seasonally like where is the sun in the morning, right?
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.880]   In half the year it's coming from one side of the house, half the year it's on the other,
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.000]   but it's pretty good. Comes back to the sensors. Some of these motion sensors also are light
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.400]   sensors. So if they're detecting like the lumens of the room, it's like you can say if the
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:00.240]   light level is higher than this, drop the shades. So it's like you can set it that way to give it
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.960]   a little more smarts. And I would also call out IKEA has some really cheap smart shades.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.520]   The company Eve also has their version of smart shades that are much cheaper than Serena.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.520]   Yeah, the Lutron Serena is the most expensive, but I went with them because
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.720]   just like the light switches rock solid, they always work. There's never an issue with them.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.480]   They get kind of the highest marks you can get, but you, of course, are paying for it
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:30.000]   because they're more expensive. But those like if you don't have like I see the replacement of
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.160]   our shades in the future for these automated ones, like it just feels like that's coming.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.240]   So, you know, at the end of the day, 10 years from now, you're going to probably have the
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.440]   same shades and I might have swapped them out. So you might have made some money.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.200]   Perhaps.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:51.120]   This is great. Yeah. I've tried to avoid going down the home assistant, home everything path of
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:56.800]   trying to hack together things on Raspberry Pis to make it all work. And it's a little promising as
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.320]   an Apple family that maybe we could do it all with Apple Home. And maybe we just need to run
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.520]   something to tie a few things together, but maybe we'll get there soon.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.160]   One random question, which I saved because I just thought you would have an opinion.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:17.600]   Do you use like AA, AAA rechargeable batteries at home or have you given up on rechargeable
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.440]   batteries? Because I feel like we bought all these like Eneloop batteries at one point,
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.240]   and I feel like they just don't hold a charge. And I'm am I missing something?
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.080]   You're not missing something. We switched 100% to rechargeable batteries. And there are some
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.760]   devices we use where it feels like we have to change them every month. It's like bananas,
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.800]   but it's because lithium ion batteries don't hold a voltage the same way as like an alkaline battery
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:49.200]   or a non-rechargeable lithium ion battery. Um, so it's a voltage issue. Uh, so if you get,
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.000]   if you buy batteries, you have to dispose of they'll last you six months or a year where
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.760]   the rechargeable ones only go every 30 days. It's, it's incredibly frustrating, but I use
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.680]   them wherever I can. And I try to avoid having to buy disposable batteries whenever I can,
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.400]   but I, I've gone back to it because it's unavoidable. Yeah. I would love to avoid
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.880]   that. But door locks are one where when we use rechargeable batteries on door locks,
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.680]   it just feels like it's a security risk because you leave town for a week and your batteries
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.560]   might die while you're gone. Exactly. You buy the disposal one. It'll be good for a year,
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.600]   but you put the eneloops in and they're dead in six weeks. It's, it's frustrating.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.960]   Any, any other random thoughts? I mean, we've covered a lot, but before we wrap on things that
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.000]   you thought about when you built this new home that, you know, you wish you had maybe known
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.200]   about or thought about earlier or would recommend other people consider if they're retrofitting or
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   building a home. This may be kind of a cop out of an answer, but I would say I actually just did a
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:56.240]   video on this recently. Keep it simple, stupid, the KISS rule. Don't, don't overcomplicate it.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.880]   Keep it simple because as we talked about in the beginning, it's like one of the first things you
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:08.160]   should do is look into like energy systems, like energy advisors in your area. The simplest thing
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.520]   you could do might be just put some extra insulation in the attic and that will save
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   you an incredible amount of money. You don't have to jump through all the hoops, get all the crazy
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:21.760]   new smart home gear, get out home assistant, do crazy smart home stuff to save money on your home.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.400]   Just keep it simple. I like it. Yeah. I think every time I put together a system
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.880]   that relied on like some Android tablet or some raspberry pie, I've never ended up keeping using
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:38.480]   it. So I support that advice. And this has been great. I have a few things to, I need to go find
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:43.680]   one of these advisors. So that's my next step and see how airtight our home is, I guess is,
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.840]   is the first step. What, what the big, big options are, because we actually considered,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.600]   do we need another battery? Uh, and now I'm wondering, maybe we don't. Before we wrap,
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.080]   I know you, I've watched a ton of these videos. Where should people find your home base to see
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.120]   everything you're working on and to go deeper on any of the things we talked about?
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:08.320]   If you go to undecidedmf.com, that's my website. It's got my YouTube videos on there. Articles
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.160]   we're writing. It's got everything. Central location would be there, including the podcasts.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.760]   Awesome. Yeah. I I've gone down a lot of rabbit holes. Keep the KISS method in mind as you're
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.920]   going down the rabbit hole of Matt's videos. Uh, I focus on the big areas and I think you could
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.000]   probably find a lot of savings and I know you've got a lot of home automation and smart home
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.280]   videos coming soon on this new house. And I'm very excited to check them out.
