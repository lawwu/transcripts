[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   First off, we recently came back from a trip to Colorado.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.840]   Just a few things happened that I thought were interesting.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.200]   One, I've started using the Flighty app almost exclusively as the way I manage all of my travel plans with flights.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.340]   The coolest thing happened, because Flighty is monitoring all the inbound aircraft and everything,
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:25.260]   I got an alert one hour before departure that they estimated that my departure would be pushed back by 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.520]   And it took a full 40 minutes before the airline actually pushed back the departure to the exact time that Flighty was estimating they would.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.280]   Now, it's no surprise that with all the data they have, they've probably learned when inbound aircrafts on this airline are delayed by this much at this airport,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.140]   it results in a delayed departure time of this.
