[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100]   [Silence]
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.900]   Grab your notes and open them up to this section where we're dealing with family life cycles.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.900]   Family life cycles.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.480]   You see here we're still working on the issue of process dynamics in counseling, in counseling
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.260]   marrying the family, marriage and family issues.
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:36.340]   We've been talking about in our last session about things that affect the family, like
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.400]   gathering data, we've got to look for evidence that would either confirm the presence or
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.360]   the absence of some of the most common marital problems.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.620]   That's important for us as counselors, but it's also important to understand that many
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:59.780]   families are at a particular stage in life, and that stage in life reflects a lot of uniquenesses
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.500]   compared to other stages in life.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.900]   It's going to bring to bear upon that family a certain amount of pressures, stresses.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.620]   And that's one of the reasons why oftentimes it's kind of interesting to look at churches
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.900]   and to watch how Sunday school classes are grouped together.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.300]   Most often you'll see Sunday school classes grouped together on the basis of these life
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.540]   cycles.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   There is the young marrieds.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.220]   Why do all the young marrieds like to meet together?
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.540]   Because they're all facing the same problem.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.620]   Or a young parents class.
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.580]   Why do all the young parents like to get together in a Sunday school class?
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.980]   Because they're all facing the same pressures and problems.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.940]   There is the senior saints class.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.100]   Why do all the senior saints want to get together?
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.420]   Because they're all facing the same kind of problems together.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.540]   Very rarely do you ever hear a class called the middle-aged class.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.860]   They don't like to be called that.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.060]   They're really middle-aged, but they like to think of themselves as still young couples.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.740]   And so they call themselves something else.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.980]   I'm the faith builders class, I'm the joiners class, I'm the whatever you call it.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820]   That's what they like to refer to it.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.100]   And those seem to be the very popular classes.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.220]   Rarely do you ever find a class that's truly intergenerational.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.860]   Why?
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:43.340]   Because most people like to hear the word of God taught to whatever stage of life they're
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.060]   in.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.940]   And applied to whatever stage of life they're in.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.460]   That's usually what they like.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.420]   When sometimes we ignore some of our greatest learning is if we could mix those young marrieds
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.020]   in with some of those senior saints and let some of those senior saints teach some of
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.740]   those young marriage some of their wisdom.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.620]   But they're divorced from that.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.460]   Wisdom that they've acquired over many, many years living out the word of God, being faithful
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.180]   to Christ in their marriages, or even the wisdom that they've gained through their failures
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.720]   in their marriage or in parenting.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.180]   So that's one of the reasons why we study this because as counselors I think it's important
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.860]   for us to be cognitive of these things.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.340]   Several years ago I started studying these things and it was interesting how I was really
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.700]   familiar with the ones that I had passed through in terms of my stages of life.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.940]   But I was, the other stages of life, the other cycles of life, I was totally unfamiliar with
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.220]   the stresses and strains that were a part of that.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.620]   And it was interesting to think that through.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.500]   Because when I have somebody sitting in front of me that's coming out of that particular
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.620]   life cycle, then all of a sudden I have a new perspective on them.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.560]   They're coming at this particular problem that they're facing from a unique vantage
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.140]   point with a unique set of pressures that are turning up the heat in their life.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.320]   What is it?
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.000]   And as a result of that, that heat is producing a certain fruit in their life.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.340]   And sometimes I like to compare it like this.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.700]   And I want to use the analogy over here that, and sometimes I'll do this in counseling.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.740]   This is like the sun here in my analogy.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:59.620]   And this is the heat in life and all the stresses and pressures and history of the relationship
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.060]   is part of that heat.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.860]   And we're going to use the biblical analogy that Psalms 1 does on comparing the Christian's
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:17.420]   life to a, or the believer's life to a tree that bears a certain amount of fruit.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.340]   And this particular tree has fruit on it.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.780]   And sometimes the fruit that's produced in this person's life as a result of this is
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:52.300]   anger or bitterness or a hatred or constant strife with other family members, with a husband
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:01.340]   and a wife, with their children, lies, lying, all of this is rotten fruit.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.460]   And you could list a lot more that's there.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.460]   Why is it?
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.740]   Because the heat's turned up in their life and this tree begins to produce a certain
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.620]   type of fruit.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.140]   Now this fruit actually comes as a result, what really fuels this is down here in the
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.060]   roots of this tree.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.740]   This is what fuels and motivates that fruit.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.260]   Like in the past, in a previous class, I talked a little bit about how a husband or a wife
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.140]   can want something out of their spouse.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.980]   All I want, a wife may say, is for my husband to love me or sometimes a husband may say,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.620]   all I want is for my wife to respect me.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.620]   That's all I want.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.620]   Now, in and of itself, that's a legitimate desire.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:03.540]   But that desire can become a idolatrous desire that captures all of their heart, it becomes
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.260]   more important than being God's kind of husband or God's kind of wife in their life.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:29.940]   And so, we put in this little heart here, I want my husband to love me.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:37.940]   That's something in this particular case that this woman becomes or this wife, this is all
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.340]   she lives for, is that.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.940]   She may call herself a Christian, she may genuinely be a Christian, but at this particular
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.220]   time, having a husband who loves her is far more important than her being a godly woman.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.340]   And so, when she doesn't receive the love and appreciation that she thinks she deserves
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.940]   in that marriage, then what happens?
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.620]   Well, then it produces or motivates the fruit.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.300]   She becomes angry, she's bitter, there's hatred, there's strife, there's lying.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.900]   You would say, well, that's all kinds of fruit that's characteristic of an unbeliever, yeah.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.060]   Is it possible for a time for believers to act like unbelievers?
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.780]   Yeah, we can see that in 1 Corinthians 5.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.020]   The man who commits adultery with his stepmother is told to be removed from the church.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.380]   In fact, Paul says, "Turn him over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.620]   soul might be saved."
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.900]   And then, later on in 2 Corinthians 2, he repents.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:45.780]   He shows himself to be a believer, but in the short run of things, he looks like and
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:55.380]   acts like an unbeliever because of his adultery and because of his fornication with his stepmother.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:02.580]   This is what the heat will do in a believer's life, it will produce all kinds of lying,
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:09.020]   strife, hatred, bitterness, anger, and there's a host of other things that can be a product
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   of that.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:16.340]   Well, I'm really interested in this life cycle at taking a look at what are the unique cycles
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:24.100]   of life that marriage and the family goes through that brings about the pressure that
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.660]   produces the fruit, because you can almost anticipate wherever that person is coming
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.260]   to you from, whatever life cycle they're coming, you know that this is part of the
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.300]   heat that's being turned up in their life.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.700]   These are part of the pressures.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.420]   So let's look at this.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.220]   The first area is probably what we call early marriage.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.180]   This is pre-children.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.240]   Young adults without kids.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.220]   Most often, this is not a strict rule, in fact, this as time goes on is increasing age-wise,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:06.420]   but approximate age is 21 to 25 years of age, but it seems like with each generation it's
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.060]   creeping up there a little bit later and later.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:17.980]   I mean, it goes into the 30s and mid-30s now, but early marriage pre-children is the idea.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.500]   They face a lot of developmental tasks at this particular age.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.940]   For example, have they appropriately separated from their parents?
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:39.740]   That is versus enmeshment or opposite, an emotional divorce that is from their parents.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.100]   Has that occurred?
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:47.220]   It's something that they didn't really want, but there's a struggle with young couples.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:55.300]   Early married, how much are we attached to their respective fathers or mothers?
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:02.620]   Or then there's learning how to balance allegiance with the family of origin.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.500]   This may be difficult, and you can see it because when they attempt to make a decision
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:16.260]   as a couple, do they run back to their parents and constantly consult them?
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.220]   Or maybe they go to their respective parents.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:28.900]   She goes to her parents, he goes to his parents, or just one of them goes to their parents.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.760]   There's pressures that can come as a result of that.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.700]   How well have they severed that relationship?
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:44.180]   This is what is expressed in Genesis 2:24 about a young man leaving father and mother.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.420]   The Bible says that's a good thing, that doesn't mean you abandon your parents, it doesn't
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.380]   mean you forsake them, it doesn't mean that you no longer have any relationships with
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.380]   them.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.380]   That's not what it's saying.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:03.060]   It's that your primary relationship is no longer to them, it is to your spouse.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.780]   That's the issue.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.740]   And young couples sometimes, to varying degrees, depending on the young couple, struggle with
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.780]   that issue.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:20.980]   How much allegiance do I have to my family of origin?
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:29.580]   Or there's also establishing mutually agreed upon rules for the relationship.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.620]   There are certain things where, well, let's take their connection to their parents, for
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.620]   example.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.860]   There could be many other things.
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.980]   There are rules that this couple talks through and say, "Okay, we're not going to run to
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.180]   our fathers or our mothers and talk about these issues.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.060]   If we have problems, we're going to work them out together.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.900]   But if we agree that we need wisdom from our parents, then we'll go together to our parents
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   and ask them.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.620]   But we'll always do that together."
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.740]   So this is a young couple working those various things through so they can establish their
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.540]   own home.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:17.060]   That's establishing some of the rules for the relationship.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.420]   And it's interesting sometimes to listen in counseling to what are the rules that you
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:28.820]   established early in your relationship when marriages get into trouble?
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:38.860]   And certain expectations that they have that they assumed were a rule in that marital relationship.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.740]   They assume that the other person agreed with this particular rule, but they didn't agree.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.980]   And when they didn't agree, this causes problems, and it causes quite a bit of stress.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.940]   And they don't resolve it, and they don't resolve it.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:57.020]   Sometimes months turns into years, and years turn into bigger problems.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.940]   And now we have an issue.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.540]   Or there's also the issue of establishing a work identity.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.580]   Usually if the husband is working and he's the breadwinner of the family, I realize that
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:20.100]   there are certain temporary exceptions to the Titus 2 rule in 1 Timothy 5 where a man
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.700]   has to be the breadwinner for his house, and the woman is supposed to be busy at home,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.060]   Titus 2.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:33.820]   There are occasional exceptions to that during different stages of life, maybe when a guy
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:40.420]   is in seminary, and his wife needs to work more, and she becomes more of the breadwinner
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.340]   during those seminary years on a temporary basis, but they're working towards her being
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.340]   in the home.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.940]   They know this is temporary.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.100]   Or maybe he has health problems, and he has to stay home for a short amount of time until
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.820]   those are resolved, and she has to go out and earn the money.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.820]   That's okay.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:04.220]   She's being a suitable helper, but that's not the norm that they're working towards.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:10.260]   So for him, when they're young, he's trying to establish some kind of identity in his
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.660]   job.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:18.540]   He's usually at the bottom of the totem pole, and so everything gets dumped at the bottom
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.060]   of the totem pole.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.020]   If there's extra work or time that has to be spent at the job that's overtime, they
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:30.980]   expect the young guy, the young buck to do that because he's new.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:38.740]   He's got to pay his dues, so to speak, in this particular job before they advance him.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.580]   And so he works really hard at establishing his identity in that work role, and that may
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:51.260]   be very, very difficult for her because he's gone a lot.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:57.820]   But if he's going to advance, this is going to have to happen.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.780]   And then establishing adult status is another big issue.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.940]   Establishing adult status.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:10.820]   This is part of the developmental task of this particular cycle.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:19.820]   The history of their relationship is primarily dating, having fun, not a whole lot of stress
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.820]   or responsibilities until they get married.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.980]   Now these things start to mount, right?
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:36.660]   And now you can't just go back and rely upon mom and dad.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.420]   You're an adult now.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.220]   Everybody begins to view you as an adult.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:48.340]   You're a married man, you're a married woman, so you've got to act like an adult.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:56.980]   There's no room here for lots of pity parties.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:03.620]   You've got to learn to accept the pressures and the stresses and strains of life the way
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.860]   an adult would accept them.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.100]   You're mature now.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:12.420]   That doesn't mean that there isn't quite a bit of area where you need to mature, but
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:21.820]   you're mature to the point, or should be, where you can bear the weight, the stresses
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:28.380]   and strains that marital life will bring, and even the stresses and strains that eventual
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.460]   parenting will bring.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.820]   You're also in the process of learning how to solve problems and establish priorities
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.180]   together.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.740]   When you're a single person, you don't have to consult anybody.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.540]   You just go about solving your problems.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.220]   Now you're married, so you learn to solve problems together, and the way in which you
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.860]   solve problems when you were a single young man or when you were a single young lady may
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:18:04.940]   be different from the way in which you solve problems as a couple.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:12.480]   He maybe grew up in a type of a situation where his parents taught him that when there's
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.740]   interpersonal strife and struggle, you go immediately to those people and you work that
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   thing out.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.880]   Well, that's not the type of home she grew up in.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.740]   She grew up in a home where if there was a lot of struggles or strife or conflict between
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.300]   people, you just avoid it.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.300]   You just avoid it.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:38.540]   Well, now, you're a couple, and now you have a problem with someone else, maybe another
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.980]   younger couple.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   There's a stress.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.900]   Well, she wants to say, "Let's just ignore it, wait, let it go by, not deal with it,"
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.060]   and he says, "No, we've got to deal with this.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.060]   We've got to go to them.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.060]   We need to sit down.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.060]   We need to talk with them.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.340]   We need to make sure we work this thing.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.940]   Oh, no, we can't do that.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.180]   That's just going to cause more problems.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.540]   How am I going to resolve this?"
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.180]   How do you solve problems together?
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.660]   How do you establish your priorities together?
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:20.300]   It's really important in life.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:29.840]   For guys that are really anxious about ministry, the ministry becomes a very, very high priority.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.180]   For their wives, oh, it's up there, but it's not up there nearly as high.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.360]   Family trumps it every time.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.620]   For him, that may be a little bit harder to discern between those two things.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.460]   Ministry family, ministry family, "Well, I'm helping my family by being a good minister."
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.580]   There's all kinds of rationalizations that take place there.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.580]   What do I do?
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:00.740]   How do I balance this out?
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:06.820]   You're adjusting to what you prioritize in terms of your marriage, and furthermore, you're
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:14.540]   adjusting to the ideas and responsibilities of marriage, or the roles and responsibilities,
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:24.500]   I should say, of marriage.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.460]   What does it mean to be a godly husband?
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:35.740]   I know when I first got married, the premarital counseling that I had was all taught to my
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:43.540]   wife and I by a Christian psychologist, and I got to tell you, I think the guy was incredibly
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.540]   well-meaning.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.460]   I mean, he was a well-meaning guy.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.100]   I believe that he was a genuine Christian, and to this day, I still think he's a Christian,
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:59.380]   but he taught us some horrible stuff about the roles and how you deal with roles in the
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.900]   husband and wife relationship.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:08.100]   My view of my role as a husband was not a biblical view at all, and I believe if my
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.220]   wife were here, she would probably say the same thing.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:17.380]   Her view of her role as a wife was not a biblical view that God would have.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.540]   We're going to talk about that later on in this class, about how God defines the husband's
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:28.860]   role, how God defines a wife's role, but there's adjusting to these roles and responsibilities
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.980]   in marriage, and what are they?
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:38.740]   If he's a real fun-loving guy, he's taking on a lot of responsibilities because now he's
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:45.260]   got to supply not just for himself, but he also has to supply for his wife.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:53.780]   That's a lot of responsibility that requires a lot of maturity.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:03.020]   Or there's also, as a young couple, adjusting to each other sexually.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.180]   For some young couples, this is easier than for others.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.020]   It can be a very difficult adjustment for some Christian young couples, and you need
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.260]   to know that if you're counseling them.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.260]   Even if you teach them, as we're going to talk about later on in the class, even if
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:28.420]   you teach them a biblical view of sexuality, what will often happen is she has a good biblical
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.820]   view of sexuality, and he has a good biblical view of sexuality.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:41.900]   They can still miss each other like ships passing in the night because she will try
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:52.060]   to satisfy her husband the way a woman would be satisfied, and he will try to satisfy her
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:23:03.320]   the way a man would be satisfied, and never the twain shall meet, and so there's difficulties.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:13.040]   We could even talk about physiological difficulties because usually early in marriage, it's not
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:20.160]   uncommon for a wife to have lots of yeast infections because what's being introduced
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.040]   into her body is foreign to that body, and until her body builds up a certain amount
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:30.880]   of antibodies to that and so on, it's not uncommon for these things to happen.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.340]   So there's adjustments physiologically.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.000]   The same thing's true with him.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.280]   So they go through an entire adjustment.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:45.560]   How do I deal with this new relationship, especially if you have a real godly husband
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:53.480]   and wife who have kept themselves pure for each other, and they have basically, they
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:24:01.520]   both have had sexual desires prior to marriage, or he has a sexual desire, she has a sexual
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.760]   desire prior to marriage, but they've said no, no, no, no, no to those sexual desires,
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:14.120]   and now you put them in a marital relationship where not only is it okay, it's expected.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.840]   So to say no, no, no, no, no, and all of a sudden automatically to turn it on and say
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.240]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes is a hard transition for some couples.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.800]   That's very difficult to do.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:34.640]   It's hard to make that rollover, and we'll talk about why in the theology why this is.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.920]   For the Christian young couple, the question is not when do we have sex.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:44.540]   The question is, according to 1 Corinthians 7, 3 through 5, it's when do we not have sex.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.880]   Sex is always assumed in the marriage.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.800]   The question is not when do we have sex.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.160]   The question is when do we not have sex.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.440]   So you're saying no, no, no, no, no, and then all of a sudden you're married.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.100]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.880]   It's hard to turn that faucet the other direction.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.200]   That's very difficult to do.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   So you're adjusting to each other sexually, and then there is this, the beginning process
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   of one fleshness.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:20.320]   Now, that includes sexual oneness, but again, this is that Genesis 224 thing where a man
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:27.920]   shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.400]   It's oneness in the fullest sense of the term.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.980]   They're one in their direction in life.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.920]   They're one in their purpose in life.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.640]   They're one in their outlook in life.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.960]   They're one in their parenting in life.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.400]   That doesn't happen overnight.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:50.760]   That is a deliberate process of weaving two lives together in marriage, and it takes a
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.560]   while to do that.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:59.920]   For some couples that are very independent in their thinking, it may take longer.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.480]   With other couples, it's a little bit easier.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.800]   They can weave their lives together pretty easy, and then there are some couples who
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   think that their lives are woven together pretty tight, and then a major problem comes
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.200]   up and they realize, "Oh, it's not as tight as I thought it was."
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.720]   So all of that has to do with the process of one fleshness.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.520]   So those are some of the circumstances.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.360]   Again, going back to our analogy here, this is part of the stresses and pressures and
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.440]   history of the relationship that begins to bring heat on their lives.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.800]   That's what begins to happen.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:40.200]   Now, what are the family strains and temptations within this stage?
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.560]   What are the family strains and temptations?
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.400]   Well, one of them is coordinating two schedules.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.160]   Usually as young couples, at the beginning of marriage, in order to get themselves established,
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.560]   they both work and they're both very busy.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   They work outside of the house, both of them for a time.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.120]   She has her job, he has his job.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.320]   They're trying to get themselves established financially so eventually she doesn't have
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.520]   to work anymore, and so they're both very busy, establishing two separate schedules.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.240]   Now, when they were single, they didn't have to do that.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.440]   They just went about and led their life their own way, and now they have to think about
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.840]   the other person all the time, and they have to think about that other person's schedule.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.560]   Maybe they can't afford, they've got two jobs and one car.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.280]   Now, how do we deal with that?
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.360]   How are we both going to get to work?
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:37.640]   Everybody's got a time schedule set here, and that's very difficult.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.200]   Or there is the constant exposure to your mate.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.200]   Now, before you're married, you think that's going to be nothing but bliss, but you find
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:56.400]   out after you're married, it's not always bliss.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:05.160]   When you were dating them, well, except for you, Jim, all right, I saw what you said.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.520]   I didn't hear it, but I saw it.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:20.880]   It's not always bliss for everybody, let's put it that way.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.060]   When you were dating, you always enjoyed your time together because you weren't together
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.080]   all the time.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.840]   You had a little bit of time of retreat from the other person.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.600]   You can go back and think about how wonderful the relationship is and dream of better days
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.920]   and stuff like that.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.520]   Some of you are going through that right now, aren't you?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.800]   Those kind of things, that's going on.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.600]   Then you get together again with them, and it's such a wonderful time, and all of a sudden
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.000]   you're married and you're around them all the time.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.200]   I mean, it's like too much chocolate.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:17.360]   There's never too much chocolate, Ruben says.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.000]   I think this summer when I went over to teach in Zurich, Switzerland, when we go over there,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.120]   we teach right in this church that's right off the Zurich airport.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:35.320]   Right next door to the church, my wife always loves going with me when we do that, is a
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.040]   chocolate factory.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.920]   We smell it all the time.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.140]   It's just wonderful if you don't live there, but the people in the area kind of get tired
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:52.320]   of it after a while, and marriage is a lot like that.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.560]   It's wonderful to be around so and so, but this is new.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:03.600]   So I have to learn how to ... I'm around them so much, and they've got habits that I didn't
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.200]   know that they had.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:11.520]   I'll never forget the first time when we were first married, walking into the restroom and
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:22.000]   seeing all kinds of girly things hanging all over the restroom.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   What is this?
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:30.200]   I mean, hanging on every free thing in the restroom, drawing.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.760]   I'm going, "I've never seen anything like this before."
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.840]   That was just kind of a shock.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.240]   You can't move without those things touching you when you're in there.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.640]   I never had to deal with that as a single guy.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.880]   That was a whole new experience for me, and I'm sure my wife had to deal with similar
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   things.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.240]   I don't know what it would be.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.280]   She's always been very kind and not shared a whole lot, but I'm sure that there's a lot
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.640]   there.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.000]   Maybe my smelly shoes or something like that.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.920]   Whoa, I've never had to deal with that, but there's a constant exposure to your mate.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   That's a difference.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:19.280]   That's a change, something you're adjusting to, and then you've got financial difficulties.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.760]   Oh, financial strains and stresses.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.640]   Now, it's interesting.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.480]   I talk about this a lot in premarital counseling, and when we do premarital counseling, we have
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.920]   a whole section where we deal with financial issues and getting themselves established
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.400]   financially because that becomes one of the big pressure points of early marriage.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.880]   But what happens, if I were to compare it like this, it would be like when that couple
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:51.080]   got married, they came out of a home where mom and dad had a certain standard of living.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.340]   Let's say that it's represented by here.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:01.920]   And so that couple naturally does not want to step down in standard of living.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:09.200]   They want to continue, at least equal that, as they move in their marital relationship.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:17.080]   Now the problem with that assumption is that it took mom and dad years to get to that level,
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.960]   to have that kind of furniture, to have those particular automobiles, to have the house
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   that they live in.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.140]   It took mom and dad years to get to that level.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.680]   But this couple thinks, "Oh, no, no, no.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.880]   I'm going to step from here right into that same socioeconomic level."
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.280]   And so they have to, and what you find out in counseling is a lot of these couples go
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:45.920]   into deep debt to step from the same level that mom and dad were, right into the same
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:52.060]   level, same kind of house, same kind of car, same kind of food, same everything to equal
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.280]   that level.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:33:00.160]   And now they have now enslaved themselves to debt for several years into their marriage
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.360]   in order to step there.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.560]   And they don't realize that they really need to start down here.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:13.500]   That when they get married, they're going to have to step way down and start back here
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:20.620]   and then start working their way up as time goes by and in their marital life where they're
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.060]   being frugal and they're saving their money, they're doing the right thing, the supply
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:32.000]   for their kids, and eventually as the years go by, they're up there where mom and dad
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.320]   was.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.000]   Or what happens if the couple doesn't go into great debt, mom and dad from one side of the
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.080]   family or maybe even both sides tries to make sure they start off on the same level.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.240]   That's not good for those kids.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.620]   It's not good.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:58.000]   Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, because they don't learn the appreciation of that money.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.100]   It's just handed to them.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.100]   Not good.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.960]   That doesn't mean that mom and dad can't loan them some money.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.320]   But every time that happens, by the way, if you're a young couple, there's always attachments
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   to that money.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.440]   Even though mom and dad will claim that there's none, there's always attachments, always expectations.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.480]   It may not show up until five years later when all of a sudden you do something that
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.640]   mom and dad doesn't like and they say to you, "I can't believe we loaned you that money."
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   "What?
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   What?
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.240]   I thought there was no attachments to that money."
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.000]   "Well, there isn't."
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.040]   "Oh, yes, there are.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.400]   There are all kinds of hidden attachments to that money."
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.320]   So you've got to be very careful then.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.360]   We're not saying it's a sin.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.960]   We're just saying that these are the unique pressures, strains, and stresses that this
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.040]   particular young couple has to decide.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.280]   What are we going to do?
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.520]   How are we going to establish ourselves financially?
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.680]   We're not looking to get rich.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   We're a Christian.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:06.600]   We want to be able to give the Lord and support ourselves and not rely upon anybody else.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:12.480]   And just in doing that, it's going to bring a lot of difficulties.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.560]   We're not trying to be Donald Trump's, not trying to be that.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.680]   Everybody else in the world is trying to be that way.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.800]   They'll probably sink themselves doing it, but we're not trying to be that way.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.500]   And then there's the pressure of work responsibilities.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:34.200]   As I said, usually if he's working, he's starting at the very bottom and there's a lot of pressure
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:39.440]   on him to perform and show himself to be a valuable, contributing member of that particular
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.400]   company.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:51.040]   So he's trying to be reliable, faithful, be a hard worker.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:36:00.200]   And when that happens, there's also a corresponding low satisfaction with the job.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.760]   He comes home at night and he says to his wife, "I cannot see myself doing this for
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.680]   the rest of our marital life.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.560]   I can't see that.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   I can't handle this."
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   So there's low job satisfaction.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:26.760]   When a couple is also trying to get themselves established financially, there is also quite
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:34.200]   frequently home tasks that are neglected.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.000]   Home tasks that are neglected.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.360]   Usually both of them are working.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:49.080]   The house and the regular things around the home are neglected, the laundry backs up,
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:58.560]   the dishes don't get washed, the sink breaks down, the commodes break down, they don't
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.080]   get repaired.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.640]   Why?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.600]   Because you're so busy just trying to make it from one paycheck to the next paycheck.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:11.080]   So a lot of things get neglected when a couple's young.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:18.360]   And sometimes, as a young couple, they don't know how to repair them to begin with.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.880]   Sometimes he doesn't know how to repair them, she does.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.360]   Sometimes she doesn't know how to repair them, he does.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.240]   Sometimes they both don't know how to repair them.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.960]   They don't have a clue how to do it.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.200]   That's something that dad always did.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   We don't do that.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.720]   It's something dad does.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.800]   So home tasks get neglected.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.600]   And then you have the general pressure of just blending two different lives together.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.280]   When she was single, she had plenty of free time to spend time with her friends, go out
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:02.840]   shopping, go play tennis, all this stuff.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   Now she's a wife.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.920]   She has much more responsibility, even prior to kids coming along.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.440]   She didn't have the free time that she did before, before they were married.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   He'd do the same thing.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.600]   He'd go play golf with his friends, go out fishing, take off, do this, that, and the
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   other thing.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600]   But now he's got to think of his wife.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.200]   He doesn't want to leave his wife alone at home when he's out there running around the
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.320]   woods shooting bears.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.920]   He doesn't want to do that.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.480]   And she doesn't like going in the woods.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   And she doesn't like bears, all right, much less shooting them and eating them.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.560]   So there are two different people coming together.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.840]   What sometimes is viewed as liability later on eventually in that marriage becomes a great
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   asset because her feminine ways complement his masculine ways, and his masculine ways
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.600]   do the same thing with her feminine ways.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.320]   But at first, it can really be a source of conflict and a rub.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   It's a difficulty.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:15.360]   So you're blending two lives together, two different lives together.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:24.520]   And you've heard the old saying, you know, different personalities are sort of attracted
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.840]   to each other.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.040]   And there's a little truth to that.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.000]   You don't marry someone just like you.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.560]   Oh, you know how horrible that would be?
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.680]   If you married somebody just like you, you married somebody different.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:48.480]   If she's a little bit quiet and he's really outgoing, she marries him because he's really
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   outgoing.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:57.200]   And he marries her because she's so solid and quiet and, you know, not all over the
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.720]   place the way he is.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:08.040]   Then when they get married, the very strengths become their partner's weaknesses.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.640]   Because he eventually says, "Wait a minute.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   She's so quiet.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.640]   She barely says anything.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.960]   Are you ever going to communicate with me?"
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.840]   And he looks, or she looks at him and says, "He's all over the place.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:29.000]   You know, he's 20 miles wide and a half inch deep.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.820]   He's just all over the place."
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:38.560]   So the very thing that was their strength prior to marriage becomes their greatest weakness
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.080]   after marriage.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.600]   Now, you notice your partner hasn't changed when that happens.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.100]   But our perspective of our partner has changed.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.100]   They haven't changed a bit.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.260]   They're still the same person.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.040]   That's the same person that you were attracted to.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:02.600]   But now afterwards, it's that very characteristic that repulses you.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.400]   It's your perspective that's changing, blending two different lives together.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.800]   And then there's resolving inevitable disagreements and differences.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.000]   There's going to be disagreements.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.100]   There are going to be differences.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.920]   You can't have two different people who have a sinful nature without these things happening.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:31.360]   So this quasi-myth that's out there, and it's perpetuated, by the way, by these computer
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:38.320]   dating services, that there's somebody out there in the world that is absolutely compatible
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.040]   to you, and a computer will find that person for you.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.760]   Just give us all your data, we'll run it through, and you think, "Oh, I have finally found the
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.240]   one person that matches up to me.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.880]   We're not going to have any problems at all.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.440]   Give me a break."
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.200]   That's not true.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.800]   This myth of compatibility is now, this great big balloon, if you will, is now punctured
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.080]   with the pin of reality.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.400]   Those people get married and they have their first fight, and you say, "They're in tears.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   I can't believe this is happening.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.520]   We were so right for each other after all the computers said so."
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:34.960]   I don't realize that there is no such thing as two compatible people.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.200]   Any two people on the planet, theologically, are incompatible.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.440]   Why?
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.080]   Because of their sinful nature.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:52.380]   The only thing that really makes marriage work in true intimacy and harmony, now there's
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.480]   a lot of artificial type of intimacy and harmony out there in the world, the only thing that
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:09.560]   makes it work is God and the gracious enablement of Jesus Christ in a couple's heart and life.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:15.680]   You can have a facsimile of marriage and even survive this lifetime with a facsimile of
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:22.420]   a marriage, but just sheer survival does not necessarily make a marriage of companionship
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.680]   and intimacy.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.760]   So there's going to be inevitable disagreements, there are going to be inevitable differences
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   that are out there.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:36.640]   There are also going to be differing ideas about roles and responsibilities.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.100]   Like for instance, she grew up in a household where mom loved to work outside, and so she
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.220]   did all the gardening and she took care of the lawn and everything, while he grew up
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.900]   in a household where that's something that dad did, so he expected that he was going
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.580]   to do that responsibility.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.420]   He wants to take care of the lawn, he wants to take care of the gardening and stuff.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.260]   That's not your responsibility.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.900]   Your responsibility is the inside of the house, my responsibility is the outside of the house,
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   he says to her.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:09.460]   And she says, "Wait a minute, no, I like the outside too, so we need to share.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:15.260]   I want you to help me with the inside and I'll help you with the outside."
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:20.920]   And he says to her, "Wait a minute, I don't do inside work.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.840]   I don't do that, all right."
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.200]   "What?
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.580]   You don't love me.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.140]   This is terrible.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:34.860]   I'm married to a beast."
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.100]   Differing ideas about roles and responsibilities.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.100]   What's your role?
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.660]   What's your responsibility?
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.400]   His mother always did the laundry.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.620]   He never had to do laundry, never had to do laundry.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:55.220]   In her household, she grew up, everybody did their own laundry.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:00.420]   So when his dirty clothes start to back up and the ham, what do they call it?
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.420]   >> Hamper.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.420]   >> Yeah, hamper.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.500]   Starts to back up and they're not washed.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.900]   He goes to her, "Hey, what about my clothes?"
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:10.900]   She says, "There's a washer."
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:17.300]   "Wait a minute, I don't do laundry.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.300]   That's not me.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.300]   I don't do that.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.300]   That's your responsibility."
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.820]   "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.420]   Everybody takes care of their own laundry in this household."
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.420]   "What?
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   Where did you get that?"
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.020]   "That's the way I grew up."
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:33.940]   "Well, just because you grew up that way doesn't mean that that's the way our household is
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.940]   going to be."
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.940]   "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.180]   So you want me to be the way your household was going to be.
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.180]   Is that it?"
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.660]   she says.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.660]   "Well, yeah.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.660]   We always did it right."
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:57.060]   There's differing roles and responsibilities.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.380]   What's going on there?
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.980]   There's also facing reality.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.140]   There's facing reality.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:11.880]   And there are a lot of things that kind of slap a couple in the face when they're young.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.980]   They come out of school or university training.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:24.940]   They think that, wow, they're the best thing that's ever happened to the world.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:30.620]   As soon as people realize that, they'll put us in huge areas of responsibility.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.340]   And they'll pay me a lot of money to do this.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:41.280]   And they begin to face the reality that's not the way life works.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.680]   And there's going to be then sexual differences as well.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.380]   She's going to view things one way sexually.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.220]   He's going to view things a different way.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.220]   She's going to view things from a masculine point of view, and she's going to view things
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.180]   from a feminine point of view.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.500]   And if they learn, those two can complement each other.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.300]   But that can be a difficulty.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:09.780]   That can cause strife in a marital relationship.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.060]   And then, of course, there's always in-law problems.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.700]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:21.940]   You want to find in-law problems, kind of put a little camera inside of a young couple's
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:28.380]   first Christmas holiday discussions.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.340]   Whose family are we going to go and visit?
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:37.380]   Well, she assumes on the holidays, we'll always go to my family, right?
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.500]   Or he assumes, we're always going to go to my family, right?
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.260]   No.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:51.540]   So here in the American holiday season, usually November has the national holiday of Thanksgiving.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:57.100]   And then December has the national holiday of Christmas.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:04.060]   So what most Christian families do, okay, one year we'll go to your family on Thanksgiving,
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.740]   and then we'll go to the other family on Christmas, and then vice versa.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.780]   And then the in-laws start to get involved.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:17.460]   I dealt with one seminary couple that were having some major problems with the in-laws
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.620]   because they had it all set up what they were going to do, they had agreed upon and everything
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.620]   was set.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:30.880]   And unbeknownst to them, one set of parents bought plane tickets for them to come to their
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.180]   house over the holidays without telling them.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:39.540]   Uh-oh, now we have problems.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:43.220]   They already had all their other plans and the other set was ready for them to come to
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:48.380]   their place, and now this set now has, and you're not going to turn down these expensive
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.380]   tickets.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:54.180]   You're not going to throw this money away, are you?
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.460]   That's rather manipulative, don't you think?
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.460]   Oh boy, now we've got in-law problems.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:06.140]   And they come to me and they say, "How do we resolve this?"
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:13.620]   Well, sometimes when in-laws do those kind of things, the sinfulness of your own human
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:23.260]   heart as a counselor wants to tell them, "Just buy a 45 and take them out, all right?"
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.900]   But that's the sinfulness of your heart, and you don't give them that kind of advice.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:34.300]   They're being rather manipulative when they do that, no, no.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:39.300]   You're going to have to, even if it's offensive to them, you're going to have to say to them,
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.740]   "Listen, we already made plans, we've already told people about the plans, we are going
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:48.340]   to come to your house, but if you went ahead and bought these tickets, I'm sorry, we can't
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.340]   honor them."
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.940]   And they're going to be hurt, that's going to be difficult.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:57.300]   They did it without consulting you, in other words, they didn't appreciate you as a young
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:04.540]   couple and your own marriage and home, they didn't respect that.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.020]   But now they're going to have to, they're going to have to.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.700]   You do that once and they'll never do that again, by the way.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.700]   Ruben?
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:17.820]   >> If you approach the situation that way, but your wife doesn't think that that's the
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.820]   best approach.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.320]   >> Yeah, that's a great question, let me repeat it.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.100]   What if you approach things that way, but your wife doesn't think that that's the best
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.100]   approach?
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.160]   It's her parents that bought the airline tickets, right?
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.980]   That would be the idea.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.580]   Her parents, and maybe we need to honor them, we don't want them, after all, they're showing
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.660]   us love by doing it.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:46.980]   Well, if you're going to follow biblical rules, then you need to say to her, "Listen, this
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:57.860]   is not what we agreed upon, and they're not respecting our relationship as a marriage."
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.800]   If she still doesn't want to follow the lead of her husband on this, then there are deeper
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:07.620]   problems than this particular episode.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:18.920]   And it goes back to her view of roles within the Christian home.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:24.460]   If you have gotten to the point where you reach an impasse as a couple, then eventually
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:29.500]   somebody is going to have to make a call and it's going to have to be him, assuming that
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:33.500]   it's not something that's overtly sinful.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:38.420]   If he's leading her to do something that's overtly sinful, then she has a biblical responsibility
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.260]   to say, "No, I'm not going to go there, can't do that because you're not my God."
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.660]   But if it's not something overtly sinful, it's a matter of opinion, and it just may
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:51.020]   seem offensive to people, but he's trying to side with righteousness, even though it
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:57.940]   may appear that he's favoring his own family, he's got to make a good decision on this.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:05.060]   So, there are all kinds of problems, and last of all, we'll take a break here, there's the
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.980]   independence-dependence issues too.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:15.740]   How independent are we of one another and how dependent are we with one another?
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:21.320]   Sometimes it takes a young couple a number of years to work that one through.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.460]   How independent are we, how dependent are we?
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:32.180]   Typically with a young couple, they're working towards an interdependence upon one another,
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.820]   but it's not so much of a slavish dependence that if God and His sovereignty were to take
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:43.380]   one of them home, the other one would have no reason to live.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:50.140]   So there is a certain independence that person has before God in their own walk before God,
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:57.300]   but it is also something that is blended together as a couple, where they're moving forward
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.540]   as one, not as two separate people.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:05.220]   They're always moving forward as one, they always have one goal, that's part of that
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:10.500]   one fleshness we're talking about.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:15.820]   Let's get back to the family life cycles, and we're gonna talk about the expanding family.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:20.060]   This is preschoolers, this is where now children entered into the picture, and now things become
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:25.860]   a little bit more complicated with kids coming into the picture, and we put on here ages
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.220]   approximately 24 to 30 years of age.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.660]   We realize that for some couples it may be earlier, for other couples it may be later,
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.740]   that's just an approximate age.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.980]   What are some of the developmental tasks here?
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.940]   Well, adjusting to the wife not working outside of the home.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:47.620]   Usually for most Christian couples, that seems to be the drawing line.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:51.140]   She may work outside of the home until the children come, and immediately when the kids
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:57.500]   show up, she quits her job, and now she begins to pay full attention to the home, and she
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:04.060]   begins to really practice Titus chapter two, where women are to be busy at home, is the
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.780]   idea there.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:13.160]   There's also resettling into a new community, and it's amazing how this changes the perspective
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:18.900]   of that young couple, because when they're young, they're almost willing to live anywhere,
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.540]   wherever's the cheapest, that's where they're going to live.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:26.500]   Once kids come into the picture, it radically changes them, because anywhere's not going
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.080]   to do it.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.780]   We don't want our kids to grow up in that environment, and so they move to a different
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.220]   environment.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.940]   That's where they want their kids to grow up.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.480]   They want it to be safer.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:44.080]   They want it to be cleaner.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:50.440]   They want the kids to have a little area where they've got a backyard and they can play.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:58.400]   So that usually requires upscaling their living conditions, requires more money, financial
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:07.600]   commitment, a lot of stuff that happens there.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:14.240]   That happened with my wife and I when we had our first child, little girl, Christa.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:32.840]   Christa came into the world back in 1980, so October 12, 1980, and it changed our whole
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.400]   perspective in life, because at that particular time, I was still in seminary and we were
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:47.480]   living in a basement of an older couple, and there was a lot of moisture in that basement,
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:54.940]   a lot of mold in that basement, and we were willing to put up with it as a young couple.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:59.420]   We didn't realize how dangerous it was even for us back then, but as soon as the baby
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.880]   came along, that changed our whole perspective.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.200]   We've got to get out of this basement.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.120]   So we began to frantically look for another place to live to get the baby out of that
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:19.600]   kind of environment, and we eventually found another place where we could live above ground.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.720]   So you resettle into a new community, and that's primarily because of the kids, and
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.960]   that's what's usually going to happen with a young couple.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:33.840]   Furthermore, there's adjusting to a new physical, social, or economic conditions.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:39.400]   Sometimes moving to another community means you have to change churches, because the church
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.280]   you previously attended is too far away now.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:48.720]   You can't go there anymore, and so you're in a new neighborhood.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:54.360]   Socially, you have a whole different new set of friends.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.320]   There's new economic conditions.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:02.840]   You're not going to the same stores or shopping at the same grocery that you used to shop
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.320]   at before.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.520]   All of that has radically changed.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.840]   You're making decisions about family size, and after the first one comes along, it's
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.200]   amazing how that begins to shape your idea about family size.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.000]   Sometimes you talk with couples prior to the first baby coming along, and they'll both
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.080]   look at you with stars in their eyes, "Oh, we both could have 20 kids."
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:31.160]   After the first one comes along, maybe two.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.600]   So it's greatly reduced.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.880]   They don't realize all the responsibilities and the pressures that are going to come along
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.280]   with that new little child.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.560]   It's a big deal.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:47.520]   So they're beginning to make decisions about family size that they'll stick with, not just
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.880]   an opinion.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:57.360]   Or they're suggesting to increase responsibilities, work, home, community, church involvement.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.080]   By the way, let me make another comment about family size.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.720]   My wife and I, now, from my perspective, I love kids.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.520]   I could have a dozen of them.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.880]   It would be easy for me.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:12.760]   I would have made a great Roman Catholic, just have kids forever and ever and ever,
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.000]   and never stop having kids.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   All right?
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   I would love them.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.760]   I didn't care about the responsibility and stuff.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:27.100]   My wife was a little bit more sane about that, and she wasn't looking at a dozen kids at
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.880]   all.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:34.120]   So we had our first two, which were two girls, and then we had our third kid, and our third
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.080]   kid turned out to be twins.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.160]   So it was third and fourth.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:42.160]   And when I saw what the twins had done to her physically, I'm going, hmm, maybe we should
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.760]   stop there.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:51.240]   Because the birth and birth process takes a toll on the wife and so on, and it's time
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.840]   to bring this to a halt at this particular time.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:59:01.280]   So you're adjusting to family size, and you're adjusting to increased responsibilities at
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.640]   work and home and community, church involvement.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.700]   Usually with kids, there becomes...
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:12.040]   You're not just involved in Bible studies and going to worship service.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:17.080]   Now you've got kids' programs that you're going to, and you're taking the kids to kids'
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:25.000]   programs and athletic events, and all of that changes what's going on in your schedule.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.480]   And the couple begins to realize, one day they wake up and they realize, you know, we
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.960]   don't have as much freedom as we used to have.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.880]   Where before, when they were dating, and then when they were newly married, they could go
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:43.040]   and do things, they didn't have to think about kids, and they had all this freedom.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.800]   It was unbelievable.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.800]   Make decisions.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   Take the kids.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   All that's gone.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:52.960]   I mean, every time you do anything, you've got to think, "Okay, now what are we going
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.960]   to do with the kids?
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:59.440]   Are we going to take them with us?
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   Are we going to leave them with grandma?
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:10.880]   Are we going to get a babysitter?
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.040]   Are we going to turn them loose in the backyard with the dog and just leave them?
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   What are we going to do?"
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:27.720]   There's a genuine loss of freedom, and there's adjusting to reduced husband and wife privacy
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   with the kids.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:37.000]   A lot of couples, for the children's sake, and it's amazing how the children almost become
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.920]   their functional god, they start this bad habit, and let me emphasize, bad habit of
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:52.880]   bringing the kid in sleeping in their room.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.560]   Bad habit.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.320]   Bad habit for the kid, bad habit for mom and dad.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:06.080]   Mom and dad needs time away from the kids in their room with the door closed.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]   They need that.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.000]   If that kid thinks that the only way they're going to go to sleep is when mom and dad is
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.280]   present, and you train them to think that, you have now surrendered all of your privacy
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.240]   and all of your intimacy to that kid.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.320]   Don't do that.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.040]   So you're adjusting to reduced husband and wife privacy.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.480]   You're adjusting to career changes as well as promotions.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.120]   He starts to receive some promotions in the job, and usually with those promotions comes
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.480]   greater responsibilities as well, or there's a change of jobs that occur.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:50.440]   Then there's establishing priorities and structuring your life according to those priorities.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.040]   What are our new priorities now?
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.640]   The children become a really high, very significant priority.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:04.200]   It's amazing how the children and thinking about them changes your daily decision making.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:11.840]   Before they didn't, now they do, and it affects everything, even in seminary.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.040]   Should I buy this book or should I buy formula for the kid?
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.800]   Oh yeah, he's got to live, so it's got to be formula, all right?
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.400]   But I'd really like to buy this book.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.960]   I mean, this is really key, I'm not going to get another deal on this book again in
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.440]   my life, so it's a hard decision.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.180]   What do I do?
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:40.640]   And then you're adjusting new roles of being a mother and a father.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.480]   It's not all cutesy.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   There is a cutesy side to it.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   Really cool.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.200]   Later on, I'm going to talk about this.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.880]   Same thing's true with grandparents when they're adjusting to new roles.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.000]   I just recently, just a year ago, became a grandparent, so I'm about ready to become
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.840]   a grandparent for a second time.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.440]   And again, I know you guys are all surprised.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.280]   How could a guy that looks 25 years of age be a grandparent?
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:13.320]   I know I have the same problem, but I am.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.760]   During the conference recently at the NAMC conference, my daughter and my granddaughter
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.120]   came down to the conference, and so we got to spend a lot of time with my granddaughter.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.840]   My granddaughter has a little security blanket, and attached to it is a little bunny's head,
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.680]   as cute as can be, and she holds it.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.120]   In fact, she takes the ear of the bunny, which is a little terry towel ear, and she holds
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.440]   the ear of the bunny right up there near her nose like this.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.080]   And then she'll trace her lips around like this, all right?
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.480]   And that's her security, and she'll just sit there and look at you like that, all right?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.680]   That's her little security blanket.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.040]   I was holding her one day during the conference, and she grabbed my finger.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.720]   And by the way, she can't say bunny, so she calls her little security blanket buggy.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.840]   This is buggy, all right?
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.680]   So I'm holding her during the conference, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, she grabs
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:09.560]   my finger, and she pulls it up to her nose, and then she starts tracing her lips with
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560]   it.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.480]   I'm going, "Oh, I'm on buggy level."
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.920]   That's a really high level to be on, is buggy level.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.360]   My wife was a little bit irritated with me because it took her two additional days to
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.120]   get on buggy level, all right?
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.320]   But I made it to buggy level before she did.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.800]   But anyhow, kids are interesting.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.480]   As a young couple, you're adjusting to be a mother and a father and all the little cute
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   things.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.040]   And sometimes, it's cute things that kids do, and sometimes, it's not so cute things.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:52.240]   I think one of my kids has the world record in projectile vomiting.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.480]   She had had a lot to eat during dinner, and we put the kids to bed one night, and all
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.480]   of a sudden, we heard this, "Ugh!"
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.520]   And we go, "Oh, one of the kids are sick."
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.760]   So both my wife and I go running upstairs, and she's laying there just so peacefully
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.680]   there on her bed, and we're going, "Hmm, she must be fine."
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.360]   So we turn around to walk out of the room, and the whole side of the other room is covered
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.760]   and dripping.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:28.160]   And we're going, "How did she do that?
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.320]   I've never seen anything like that in my entire life.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.360]   Oh, my goodness."
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.200]   It's a whole change.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.920]   And you think to yourself, "Oh, this is late at night.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.080]   One of the last things I want to do is spend the entire night wiping down a room.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.080]   All right?
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.880]   This is going to take us half the night."
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.600]   And then all it took was one, "Ooh!" on her part to do it.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.640]   That's all it took.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:59.040]   So you're adjusting those new rules, and it's very demanding.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:05.360]   Now that girl who did that, which was Melissa, is about ready to have her first baby.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:11.560]   So we're hoping that that baby returns the favor.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.760]   So we're adjusting the new rules of mother and father.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.480]   Then there's handling the pressure of the criticism from grandparents.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.600]   "Oh, this is a biggie.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:27.960]   You know, you're not doing what grandma and grandpa on either side thinks is right.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.240]   That's not a good way to rear your kid.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.520]   And you're trying to make the best decisions you can, and yet you want to be an independent
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   home.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.600]   But you want to learn from your mother and father, but you're not going to do everything
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   that they did.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.400]   And you're not going to do it the same way that they did.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.600]   And so it's going to be different.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.520]   It's going to be different."
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.480]   And you're getting pressure, and some of that pressure comes in the form of criticism.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.320]   "Why are you doing it that way?
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.320]   We never did that with our kids.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.720]   Oh, that's quite a statement.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.040]   We never did it that way with our kids.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.760]   We never treated you that way when you were a kid.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.860]   Well, hmm."
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.800]   So there's pressure there.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:25.120]   If you're not doing anything wrong, physically wrong to the child or sinful in God's eyes,
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.740]   then you got to be able to look at the grandparents and say, "You know, we love you, and we think
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:35.600]   you did a great job, I mean, pretty great grazing us.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.280]   But we're not always going to do things exactly the way you did, but that doesn't mean we
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280]   don't love you.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.160]   It's going to be different.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.080]   We're a different couple.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.080]   We're different than you and dad."
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:53.200]   So, yes, Ruben?
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   What about discipline?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.440]   Yeah, see, there's another area.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   In the area of discipline, it may be different than the grandparents disciplined people.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.360]   For example, here's another issue.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:18.600]   Recently counseled a couple who spanked their children, but always did it in a very controlled
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:24.800]   way, in a very loving way, but firmly spanked their kids and let the kids know that when
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:36.000]   they did wrong, well, one of the sets of parents said to those parents, "If we ever see you
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.440]   do that to our grandkids, we're going to report you to social services."
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:47.960]   So the couple comes to me and they say, "What do we do?"
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.800]   And I said, "Number one, is it wrong?
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.200]   Is it a sinful thing that you're doing?"
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.380]   "No, it's not a sinful thing you're doing."
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.640]   "Number two, is it something unlawful that the government says is wrong?"
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.280]   "No, it wasn't something that was unlawful the government said was wrong."
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.720]   So they can report all they want, but eventually you're going to be innocent.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:10.440]   But if they're going to try to control you and the way that you're dealing with your
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.480]   kids and you're not doing anything sinful and you're not doing anything unlawful, then
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.320]   you may have to get to the point where you say to them, "We love you, but as long as
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:24.560]   you have this stance, we're not going to bring our kids around you anymore."
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.780]   And that's what they had to do with that set of grandparents.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:37.420]   If grandma and grandpa are going to be that intrusive into the life of their kids and
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:44.640]   are willing to imply that they're going to have their kids locked up for something that
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:54.000]   they're not doing that's wrong, then that has become a destructive relationship.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:04.700]   So that's how bad it can get with grandparents if they get that manipulative and that controlling
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.920]   in the life of their grandkids.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.400]   Now rarely, you know, in probably the past 30 years that I've been doing counseling,
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:18.700]   the past 30 years, maybe I've had that happen once or twice at the most.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.520]   Rarely will that ever happen.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.200]   Most grandparents don't take that position.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.480]   But every now and then, you'll run into that kind of a situation.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:37.120]   And those parents have got to make the decision what's right before God and follow their conscience.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.360]   Hopefully their conscience is informed by the word of God, but they've got to follow
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.320]   their conscience on that issue.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:50.720]   And in that case, they're going to have to restrict their kid's exposure to grandpa and
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.880]   grandma because this is their children first.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.320]   Well, first they belong to God, then it's their children, and only thirdly do those
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:06.200]   kids have any relationship to grandpa and grandma, but that's third down the line.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.080]   Kids belong to God first, then they belong to us.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.260]   We only have a short amount of time with those kids, and we have to exercise good stewardship
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:22.240]   with them, and then only thirdly are they a reflection of whether they belong to grandpa
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   and grandma.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:28.120]   So, pressure, criticism from grandparents can be a pretty serious thing.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.320]   All right, so those are some of the developmental tasks.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.680]   What about the family strains and temptations?
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.300]   Well, again, when kids come into the picture, that changes everything.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.600]   And one of the issues that it changes is finances.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:46.840]   There becomes financial pressures, strains, and stressors that are now turned up.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.040]   It's amazing.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:55.600]   And my wife and I were always fairly healthy as a couple, weren't sick very much, hardly
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.520]   at all until kids came into the picture.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:03.280]   I don't know, I used to say that it's because these kids are so close to the ground, they're
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.000]   down there where the germs are, all right?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   That's where they are.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.400]   You pick them up from the ground, so you're bringing all these germs up with you, all
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.400]   right?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.920]   But all of a sudden, kids come into the picture, they are little teeny incubators of bacteria.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.400]   That's what they are.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.040]   And they incubate these bacteria, and they spread them around the house.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.280]   And then all of a sudden, you have more colds, and more flu, and more...
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   That's what kids do.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.200]   Now, some of you had kids.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.200]   Am I right about this?
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.760]   I mean, this is what happens.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.040]   Kids change the whole dynamic.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:44.760]   And so there's more doctor's bills, more hospital bills that are going on.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:51.640]   Our twin boys now are in college, and just this past weekend, they were playing an intramural
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:59.840]   college football game, and the one boy got elbowed in the nose during the game, and it
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.820]   just started gushing with blood.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.520]   So he had to go to see if he got his nose broke.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:12.280]   Because the previous year, same circumstance, his twin brother got his nose broken.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:18.760]   Well, he didn't have his nose broken, but it was sure draining a lot of blood.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.360]   So there's doctor's bills, and x-rays, and stuff.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.200]   This is the way kids are going to...
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.520]   Financial pressures, those are the things that come up.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.160]   That's always going to be there.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.640]   And I always see couples, they'll say to me, I said, "When are you going to have kids?"
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.680]   They say, "Well, we're waiting until we're financially able to then."
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.560]   "Oh, well, you're never going to have kids then, right?"
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.680]   No, you just kind of fit kids around your finances.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.360]   You don't wait until you have a lot of money to have kids.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.600]   If you do, you'll be waiting forever, and the kids will think that they were born to
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.920]   grandparents.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:01.800]   So they'll never know they're real grandparents, they'll think you're the grandparents.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.760]   There's different views in regard to father and mother responsibilities.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:14.000]   Now sometimes different views on what they consider to be responsible behavior.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.760]   I've seen couples get into arguments over what's being fed the baby, because she and
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.800]   her family, her mother used to feed babies certain amount of things, or certain types
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.420]   of things.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:32.600]   And he and his family used to feed babies different things.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.480]   And he sees her feeding the kids what her family used to feed them.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.600]   "You're going to feed our kid that stuff?
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.600]   That's horrible."
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.560]   "You shouldn't feed her that stuff, you're going to ruin our kid."
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   "What do you mean?
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.080]   I grew up with that stuff.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   You think I'm ruined?
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.480]   You think I'm a ruined person, because I grew up with that."
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:15:01.240]   Well, there's a different role, father and mother, and responsibilities there.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:07.200]   There's different views in regard to parenting, different views about whether or not to spank
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200]   a child.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   How do you spank a child?
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.840]   Do you use a rod or an instrument to spank a child?
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.080]   Do you use your hand to spank a child?
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:24.440]   Do you use a belt to spank a child?
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.360]   Or one, husband or wife, may come to the conclusion that you're not supposed to spank a child
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360]   at all.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.000]   Don't spank a child.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.560]   That'll ruin their self-esteem.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.000]   It'll harm their psyche if you do.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.320]   And so they have this negative view, and most of that has probably been culturally informed,
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.080]   and a lot of that is built upon a wrong analysis of studies.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:16:00.360]   Most of those studies go back to the mid-1950s, and Benjamin Spock did a whole series of studies
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:06.280]   that was government-funded on infant monkeys, and he found out that if you spank infant
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.520]   monkeys for doing something wrong, and you reintroduce those infant monkeys back into
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   a cage with other monkeys their same age, then the ones that have been spanked becomes
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.520]   very aggressive.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.920]   They'll hit and bite and steal, and they're much more angry, and so as a result of that,
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:26.040]   he very committed to an evolutionary view of man, believes that an infant monkey is
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.480]   only a half step down from an infant human.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.200]   There's very little difference between the two, according to Benjamin Spock, and so if
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.140]   you do that to a child, when a child's growing up, then you're gonna teach that child aggressiveness,
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:43.840]   you're gonna teach that child anger, but we would say as Christians, there's a radical
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:50.320]   difference between that infant monkey and that child, radical difference.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.280]   And furthermore, usually most of the studies that are done on spanking make no differentiation
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:04.080]   between a parent who spanks a child in uncontrolled anger and a parent that spanks a child for
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   the child's benefit.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.420]   There's no distinction made between the two, so the conclusion is that if you spank your
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.780]   child, then your child will grow up to be an angry, aggressive child.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:21.020]   Well, I wanna let you know that I was spanked my entire childhood, and that actually was
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.300]   a positive thing for me.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.500]   We spanked all of our children as they were growing up.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:31.780]   They have not turned out angry or aggressive, none of that is the case.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:38.460]   I've never met in all of my years of ministry, couples that spank their child where the child
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:42.460]   grew up aggressive because they were spanked.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:48.700]   But I have met children that grew up aggressive because when the parents spanked them, they
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:54.400]   took out their anger on them in uncontrolled anger, and a child understands the difference
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.540]   between the two.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:02.700]   And so a child learns from the parent's example that when you get angry, you just go out and
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.220]   hit something or hit somebody.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:12.500]   No, no, there's a huge difference between spanking in uncontrolled anger and spanking
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.380]   a child for that child's benefit, even though you may be angry at the child, 'cause I know
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:27.420]   there are some Christian psychologists out there that teach the philosophy that you should
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.140]   never spank your child in anger.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:36.740]   Well, if that's true, I would have never spanked my child, because I'm always angry about the
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:43.580]   fact that they have done something wrong that they know better.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:52.020]   Even my little 14-month-old granddaughter, Abby, has a conscience, and she can't say,
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:59.140]   "Forgive me," or, "Will you forgive me," so her mother has taught her to say, "Ta-ta."
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.780]   And she loves doing something wrong.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.920]   You know what it is?
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.580]   It's taking a tissue box and unloading it.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:09.980]   She just loves it.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:15.020]   She loves to see how long it's gonna last, and there'll be this pile of tissues, all
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.020]   right?
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:20.620]   Just taking all the tissues out of the tissue box and unloading those tissues until there's
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:26.300]   a great big pile there, and she can do it, oh, so quietly, but she gets more fun out
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.580]   of doing that, and she knows it's wrong.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:35.700]   And she'll do it without her mother knowing, and then she'll go into her mother and say,
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:38.420]   "Ta-ta."
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.540]   What did you do, Abby?
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:46.900]   Mother will go in the other room, "Abby, ta-ta, ta-ta."
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.500]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.980]   Abby, you know that's wrong.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:58.980]   At 14 months, that kid's got a well-defined conscience.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.860]   Kid knows.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:04.740]   Tell me an infant monkey that can do that.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:09.580]   I don't do that, because that kid has a conscience.
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:14.300]   It's a God-created conscience.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.700]   So there's gonna be differing view of parenting.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:25.820]   There's gonna be differing views about family boundaries.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:34.060]   He grew up in a household where everybody in the household, when you walked out of your
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:37.300]   bedroom, you were fully clothed.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.380]   She grew up in a household, when you walked out of the bedroom, people would run around
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.540]   the house in their underwear.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:52.500]   So her brothers and sisters and mother and father ran around the house in their underwear.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:21:01.660]   So she leaves the bedroom in her underwear, and he's horrified.
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.660]   "What are you doing?
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.820]   Get behind closed doors."
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.780]   "We don't do that."
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:12.220]   "Oh, our family always did this."
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:17.380]   Differing views about boundaries.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:21.060]   And this can go into several different areas.
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:29.740]   Maybe she writes a, she keeps a diary, and these are a diary about her private thoughts
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:33.460]   about things.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:38.100]   And she doesn't want anybody to read that.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.300]   It's just her private thoughts before God.
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.420]   So she leaves it around the house, and one day she walks in, and her husband's sitting
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.500]   there reading her diary.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.620]   "What are you doing?
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.860]   You're not supposed to be reading that."
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.580]   She grabs it from him.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.140]   "What?
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140]   You're my wife.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.260]   Those are just my private thoughts before God.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:02.620]   What are you doing reading my diary?"
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:04.460]   "I didn't mean to.
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.500]   I saw it sitting there, and I thought it would be interesting, and you're my wife, and we
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.380]   share the most intimate part of our lives together.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.380]   What's the issue?
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:14.060]   What's the big deal?"
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:21.180]   "No, that's just for me.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:26.500]   My wife used to keep a diary, but I never read it.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:31.380]   She'd always have it sitting around the house, kept it on a daily basis, pretty extensive
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.380]   thing.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.980]   I think we still have it somewhere stored away.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.700]   Her thoughts before God.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:49.580]   I wish I would have read it, because 15 years into our ministry, she got saved.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.980]   She knew how to function around Christians.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.020]   She knew how to act like a Christian.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:23:00.940]   She had grown up in a pastor's home, but she wasn't a believer until 15 years into our
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.460]   ministry.
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:10.300]   And after she got saved, she showed me her diary, and I began to read past years.
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:14.500]   I'm going, "I didn't know she thought this.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.620]   I had no idea.
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.620]   She kept it very, very private.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.860]   Now, she didn't tell me I couldn't read it.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:29.540]   I just respected her space, so to speak, but now I wish I would have read it.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.660]   If I would have read it, it would have been very plain what her spiritual condition was
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660]   before God.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:43.000]   And actually, she came to Christ when she was teaching a Sunday school class of fourth
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.620]   and fifth grade girls.
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:48.420]   And she came to me one night, and she says, "You know, I don't think these girls really
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:52.780]   understand salvation, so what do I need to study in the Bible, and what's some books
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.940]   that I need to read in order to teach these girls about salvation?"
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:24:00.500]   So I gave her some ideas, and here's some following passages you need to study.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.820]   So she went up to the room, and she began to work on this, and began to work on it,
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.180]   and started reading, reading.
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:08.180]   And all of a sudden, the thought dawned on her, "You know, as I'm reading about what
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:15.100]   it means to really be a believer, this is not true of me."
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:21.540]   And God ended up using that to bring her to Christ.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.740]   She didn't tell me that night what had happened.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740]   The next day, I get a call.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.340]   One of the secretaries says, "Your wife's on the phone, and she needs to talk with you
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   right now."
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:31.340]   So I go, "Whoops.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:32.340]   Something must be up."
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:35.220]   So I answer the phone, and she says, "Can you meet with me for lunch?
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.860]   I need to talk with you about something."
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.140]   Now, when my wife says that, I'm going, "Uh-oh.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.140]   Something's going on.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.140]   Okay.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.420]   Let's meet for lunch."
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:48.820]   So we set up a little lunch appointment at Arby's Roast Beef, and we sat down, and she
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:50.900]   says, "Do you remember what I asked you about?"
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.900]   "Oh, yeah."
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:56.500]   And then she shared with me how God used that to convict her of life.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.100]   I thought, "This is great."
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.180]   She didn't know how I was going to react.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.180]   "This is great.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.180]   This explains everything."
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:09.460]   Now, the issue began, "How do we break this to our church?
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:14.860]   Their pastor's wife, for the last 15 years, has not been a believer."
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.900]   So we carved out an entire Sunday evening service, and I stood with her, and she shared
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.460]   how God changed her life.
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.300]   Interesting mixed reaction from our church because she had counseled and worked with
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.860]   an awful lot of ladies there.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:30.820]   Some of them were really joyful, and then there were others that were mad at her.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.820]   "Oh, that can't be.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:32.820]   That can't be.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   I can't accept that."
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.820]   "You weren't a believer before?"
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:35.820]   "I can't be."
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.420]   "That can't be.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.580]   I trusted the fact that you were a believer."
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:45.100]   I actually got angry at her.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:50.900]   But I had the opportunity to then baptize her later, which was really great.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.980]   But I wish I would have read that diary long before.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:26:01.220]   Boundaries, boundaries.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.500]   Sometimes they're legitimate ones.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:06.340]   Sometimes they're not legitimate ones.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.020]   There's also problems caused by fatigue and busyness.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.140]   Children especially introduce that one.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.340]   It seems they never let up.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:19.780]   They never let us have a full night's sleep once the kids get there.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:22.840]   There's something that's always interrupting you in the middle of the night.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:29.140]   Some kid wakes up crying, or they've had a bad dream, or they have some illness or sickness,
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:31.220]   and they're not sleeping well.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:36.140]   And so as a result of that, you're not sleeping well, and you're constantly busy taking care
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.140]   of them.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:42.900]   Plus, you have your own responsibilities at work the next day, and your wife has responsibilities.
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.100]   So there's lots of pressures there.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:53.060]   There's concern about family health, and most of that is because of the kids.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:57.940]   The kids themselves have changed the whole dimension of family health.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.300]   There's also decisions that you need to make, and these become more difficult, especially
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:09.420]   with in-laws and the family, on holidays because the kids are there.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:16.460]   Having to visit relatives and vacations, and grandpa and grandma always wants to see the
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.460]   grandkids.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:21.420]   They always want to see.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:24.200]   So who do we visit on the holiday?
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.620]   Because we've got her family who wants to always see the kids, his family always wants
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:30.620]   to see the kids.
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:31.620]   Where do we go?
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:39.460]   Holidays, vacations, you can't always go one place.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:46.420]   How do we divide this out, and then how do we work it into extended family schedules?
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.080]   Because they have their own families, they have their own schedules, they have their
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.380]   own things that they're doing.
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.220]   How do you do that?
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:59.940]   That can cause some serious strains and temptation on the relationship.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:03.860]   And then, with all the business that's going on, then how do you fit sex into a schedule
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:05.300]   like that?
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.300]   Wow.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:11.540]   Oh, that's hard.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:15.300]   Too tired tonight, sweetheart.
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:22.460]   Well, when are you not going to be tired?
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:29.340]   The second Tuesday of next week.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:30.340]   Too tired.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:39.740]   So how do you fit that into what's going on in these family relationships?
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:47.220]   For some couples, they end up postponing and postponing and postponing and postponing their
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:54.580]   intimacy and their relationship, and it ends up causing a serious problem in their relationship.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:59.580]   And this is exactly what 1 Corinthians 7:5 warns about.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:02.420]   Grab your Bible just for a moment, and let's go over there.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:10.140]   1 Corinthians 7.5.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:17.140]   Here Paul's talking about the intimacy between a husband and wife, and he says here, "Stop
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:25.260]   depriving one another except by agreement for a time so that you may devote yourself
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.420]   to prayer and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.420]   of self-control."
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:38.100]   I'm interested in the latter part of that verse.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:50.700]   Once this husband and wife is used to an ongoing mutually satisfying sexual relationship, and
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:57.340]   then there is an extended period of denial of that relationship, then that sets both
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:03.100]   of them up for failure.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.820]   Because he goes to work, and all of a sudden there's a nice young lady at work that starts
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:13.980]   paying attention to him, and wow, she's very, very sweet.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:18.820]   And she goes about her duties, and all of a sudden there's a really nice young man who
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:28.020]   starts paying attention to her, and all of a sudden he's really, really a nice guy.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:38.920]   So once a husband and wife is used to a regular mutually satisfying relationship in the marriage
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:46.660]   on a sexual level, and then you deny each other, the Bible says you give Satan a foothold
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:52.940]   in your marriage.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.000]   Satan gains territory.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.780]   He says, "Come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.940]   self-control."
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:10.500]   The introduction of children into a marriage can cause that to happen.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:16.620]   And you have got to reserve time for one another.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:23.380]   Sometimes it takes much more deliberate planning rather than maybe you're used to a relationship
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:26.260]   where everything just always happens spontaneously.
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:29.600]   Well, you can't do that with kids.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.820]   It's got to be much more deliberate and planned now because the kids get up at a certain time,
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:38.700]   and they go to bed at a certain time, and they eat at a certain time, and so you got
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:39.700]   to be prepared.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:44.980]   So everything in your life is scheduled around what's going on with those kids.
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:52.160]   So now your times of intimacy have got to be much more scheduled.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:57.680]   Just because it's scheduled and not spontaneous does not mean that's a bad thing.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.180]   It's a good thing.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:07.380]   Well, it's not as fun if it's scheduled.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:12.880]   Well, that's all in the mind.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:18.340]   When you want to go visit an amusement park, you have to schedule it, and you still have
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:19.340]   fun, right?
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:21.900]   Yeah, you have to schedule it.
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:25.180]   You don't just spontaneously trip into an amusement park.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.260]   Well, a few people don't do that.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.540]   You don't do that.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:30.540]   It's scheduled.
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:31.540]   But you still have fun.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.620]   And you can still have fun if you schedule your relationship and say, "Okay, we know
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:40.140]   the kids are going to be asleep now, and they're not going to be demanding or nothing's going
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:44.020]   on, so the two of us need to get away separately and spend a little time together."
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.580]   That's all right.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.460]   That's okay.
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:55.100]   But understand, when you're counseling young couples that have children, this is a pressure
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:58.860]   point.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:03.540]   So it's not uncommon for me when I'm counseling couples that are at this particular life cycle
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.300]   to ask, "Hey, how are things going?"
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.340]   I mean, "How are things going sexually?
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:11.820]   Is everything going on in your marriage?"
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:17.380]   I am not probing that area because I'm curious about their particular sexual life.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.380]   You know what?
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:22.020]   I know way too much about way too many people, and you're going to get this way too.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:25.540]   There's not a bit of curiosity left in my entire body.
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.060]   It doesn't exist, all right?
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:32.620]   The only reason I'm asking them that kind of question is because I'm interested in their
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:38.280]   marital welfare, and I know that that is a stress and temptation at that particular stage
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.460]   of life.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.460]   I know that.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:43.920]   So how is it?
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.260]   I'm a nosy pastor, okay?
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:48.260]   How's it going?
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:58.340]   Well, to be perfect frank about it, it's been a while since we've been intimate.
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:33:59.780]   Really?
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.140]   Why?
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:08.220]   Well, I'm busy at work, she's busy with the kids at home, you know, and when we get done
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:13.260]   at the end of the day, we're so exhausted, we just kind of just drop into bed exhausted.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:19.540]   Well, you know, you're giving Satan a foothold in your marriage.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.540]   We are?
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:22.540]   Well, look at this.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:25.660]   1 Corinthians 7, 5.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.200]   You're setting yourself up for a disaster here.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.780]   That means you have got a plan to have times together.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.580]   That's vitally important.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:40.500]   Long after the kids are grown and out of the house, you'll still have your relationship,
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:46.480]   and part of that intimacy is making an investment into the future of your relationship.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.940]   You start building your life around those kids, you're setting your home up for a disaster.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:57.900]   One of the worst things you can do as a Christian family is to have a child-centered home.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:01.860]   That's one of the worst things you can do.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.220]   You're letting the kids determine everything that happens in that home.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.220]   No.
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:07.220]   What's the kind of home you need to have?
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:13.980]   You need the kind of home that is a marriage-centered home.
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:18.980]   It's something that the kids revolve around.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:26.500]   A little bit later on in the class, I will talk about why that is so vitally important
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.980]   because that makes a lot of decisions for you.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:33.500]   When you have a marriage-centered home instead of a child-centered home, that changes the
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:39.420]   whole dynamic of the house, and that's exactly what God says you ought to have.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:40.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:41.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:42.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:43.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   God loves you.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:49.420]   God loves you.
