[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   the lunch with the billionaire story goes back to November of 2021.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.600]   This was like a Twitter thread on the topic of paradoxes.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.200]   I wrote a sort of curation of like 20 of my favorite paradoxes that I feel like
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.640]   I've come across in my own life or that I've struggled with on a regular basis.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.960]   Fast forward to January, 2023, I wake up in the morning to a bunch of texts from
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.160]   friends saying like, Whoa, Bill Ackman shared your tweet thread.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.120]   And he has quote tweeted this thread from November, 2021 saying a friend
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.440]   sent me this last week.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.820]   It contains tons of wisdom.
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.720]   Everyone should read it.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.560]   So I replied to his tweet and say, thanks for sharing my work, Bill.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.160]   We should get lunch in New York sometime on me.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.200]   And he replies and says, would love to do that.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.440]   And I ended up getting to have lunch with Bill Ackman as a result of this Twitter
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.280]   thread that I had written 18 months before a perfect example of expanding
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.120]   your luck surface area and how content is a great, great example of that.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.680]   Like you put something out into the world and it's still creating lucky
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.160]   encounters for you 18 months into the future.
