[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - Today we address a critical spirit.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.800]   The question comes in from a listener named Alan.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.640]   Here's his email.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.660]   Pastor John, thank you for your insight
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780]   on many topics in this podcast.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.960]   My question for you is this.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520]   What does the Bible say about a critical spirit?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160]   What is a critical spirit?
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.400]   I assume holding high expectations
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.320]   is not the same thing as having a critical spirit.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.120]   So when do high expectations become sinful judgmentalism?
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.160]   And how can I fight against this tendency inside of me
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.520]   to focus mostly on the failures of others?
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.840]   - That last question is exactly the right question
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.440]   to ask for all of us.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   And I include myself here,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.760]   who am, John Piper is wired to be critical.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.520]   I remember taking a personality test,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.560]   and I think it was Myers-Briggs ages ago.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.040]   And my letters came back, I can't remember.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.520]   I think it was INTJ or something like that.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.120]   This is not the kind of person you want to live with.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   (both laughing)
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.640]   I remember, you know, they said,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.000]   "Okay, here's your number, Piper.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.300]   And here's the narration
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.240]   of what that personality type is like."
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480]   And you know what one of the mottos was?
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.240]   The motto was, "There's always room for improvement."
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.080]   - Oh, wow.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320]   (both laughing)
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.120]   - Now, it's good to know that about yourself
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.880]   because it means that you're a hard person to live with.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.760]   Nobody likes to be under an incessantly scrupulous eye
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.700]   that basically says, "Well, no matter how hard
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.740]   and how well you do your job,
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.480]   it could have been done better."
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   I mean, that makes for a pretty oppressive marriage
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.860]   or Sunday school class or church.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.080]   So I had to be really on top
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.940]   of the sinful proclivities of this way
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.240]   that I was just born, right?
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.440]   No excuses here.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.020]   I'm not trying to make anything easy.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.920]   So this question, therefore,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.440]   that's why I say this last question is so right.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.020]   That is, what can we do or how can we think
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.180]   or are there steps we can take
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.300]   so that we do not become hypercritical people?
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.340]   And if we're wired that way, we can be changed
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.740]   or exercise self-control to channel it
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.740]   into properly analytical efforts and not people ruining.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   So what are the strategies that I have found in the Bible
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.940]   and in my own life that might be helpful here
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.280]   not to be hypercritical or judgmental person?
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.140]   You'd have to ask my wife how successful I've been at this,
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.260]   but I'm sure bent on being better.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.680]   Number one, let's zero in on the word judgmental
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.940]   just because Alan referred to it
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.340]   and Jesus addresses it directly.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.400]   Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.020]   but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.460]   Or how can you say to your brother,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.280]   let me take the speck out of your eye?
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.180]   In other words, I'm a super hypercritical person.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.480]   I see specks everywhere.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.580]   So what can I do to take the speck out of your eye?
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.520]   When you've got a log hanging out of your eye, Jesus says,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.400]   you hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.360]   Then you will see clearly to be a good eye surgeon
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.860]   and take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.400]   So Jesus' answer to the question,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.640]   how not to be hypercritical about the speck
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.180]   in your brother's eye is to be deeply aware
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.820]   of the log in your own.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.820]   Now, I don't think that means that the very thing you spot
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.600]   in the other person that you think is a speck
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.920]   is worse in you than in him.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.320]   I don't think it means that.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.560]   That's not, that doesn't work.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   But what it means is there's plenty about me
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   before God and man that should disincline me
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.160]   to be quick to judge others for specks
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   because if I got the just judgment that I deserved,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.500]   it would be devastating.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.100]   That's, I think, the gist of what it means.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.940]   And it really, really works.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.940]   I mean, that has a deep effect on slowing down
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.720]   your criticism of others,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.740]   at least de-intensifying it because you know
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.320]   that if God were to treat you with the same rigor
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.020]   that you're now treating him, you'd be undone.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.580]   Number two, and this is really an extension
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.840]   of the first point, never lose sight
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.840]   of what you have been saved from or how much it cost
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.020]   and how much remaining corruption there is still in you.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.100]   And I base this on Ephesians 4:32.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.640]   Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.180]   forgiving one another, forgiving one another
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.100]   as God in Christ forgave you.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.060]   Forgiving as you have been forgiven carries an implication.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.440]   And the implication is being ready to treat people
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.320]   way better than they deserve because we have been treated
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.040]   so much better than we deserve.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.700]   So even though we don't call it forgiveness
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.040]   when we are less critical at the front end
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.520]   of a relationship, we're less critical,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.260]   the root is the same.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.060]   We treat people better than they deserve
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.920]   because God treats us better than we deserve.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   And it cost Christ his life for God to treat us that way.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.540]   That's number two.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.100]   Number three, fill your heart and mouth
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.800]   with thanksgiving for everything, Ephesians 5:20.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.380]   Give thanks always and for everything.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.960]   Be an amazingly, overflowingly thankful person.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.940]   In other words, be radically, radically grateful.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.080]   Practice waking up in the morning with thankfulness,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.740]   walking through the day with thankfulness,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.400]   going to bed at night with thankfulness
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   because a thankful spirit pushes out a critical spirit.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.920]   Number four, meditate on what love is
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.280]   and how essential love is to the Christian.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.160]   What does it mean to love people?
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.880]   And I think most of us should memorize
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.680]   all of 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.280]   That chapter is only 13 verses long.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.320]   It's the most important chapter on love in the Bible.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.200]   And you can memorize it in a week,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.560]   if you put your mind to it,
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.720]   and then say it to yourself over and over again
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.660]   for a year or so, see what happens.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.780]   Love is patient and kind.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.880]   Love does not envy or boast.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.640]   Love is not arrogant or rude.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.240]   It does not insist on its own way.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.080]   It's not irritable.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.840]   Oh my goodness.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.280]   It's not resentful, that it doesn't keep an account of wrongs.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.480]   It does not rejoice at wrongdoing,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.760]   but rejoices in the truth.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.560]   Love bears all things, believes all things,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.960]   hopes all things, endures all things.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.360]   Good night.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.680]   Memorize that, say it and say it,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.840]   pray it and pray it until it's you,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.520]   and God will heal you of much of your hypercritical spirit.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.320]   Number five, this is real pragmatic
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.280]   and people doubt the value of this,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.060]   and I'll explain why they shouldn't.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.060]   Ask yourself this, what good is it going to do
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.160]   for anyone for me to constantly feel so critical of others?
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.960]   What good is it going to do anybody, me or them?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.880]   Now, you may think a question like that
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.520]   is emotionally useless.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.000]   Like, so what?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.120]   I mean, that doesn't change me.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.840]   Asking that question doesn't change me,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.800]   it doesn't help me.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.720]   Well, if that were true, if that question were useless,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.860]   why did Jesus say when he was trying
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.560]   to help us overcome anxiety,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.600]   which is just as hard to get rid of as a critical spirit,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.080]   why did he say this?
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.880]   And which of you, by being anxious,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.440]   can add a single hour to his span of life?
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.040]   So here's my paraphrase.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.800]   It doesn't do any good to be anxious.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.640]   It's just, it's pointless.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.600]   You know, nothing happens, right?
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.080]   Well, why are you anxious?
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.560]   You're accomplishing nothing.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.480]   And I know a lot of people hear that and say,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.400]   well, how does that help?
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.640]   So say that about being hypercritical.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.920]   It just doesn't do any good.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.300]   Now, that's not the only strategy,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.320]   but add that to your arsenal of weapons,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.800]   because Jesus said, that's a good question to ask
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.360]   when it comes to lots of sins.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.680]   What good do they do it?
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.000]   How are you helping anybody with that particular bent?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Number six, cultivate a view of life, hour by hour,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.800]   that is more expansive, bigger heart, global, universal,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   all-encompassing, God-entranced.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.900]   Look at the whole of life.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.320]   Look at the whole of the universe.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.120]   Look at the whole of nature.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.280]   Look how big it is,
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.840]   and look at all of its dazzling wonders,
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   and be amazed at the world you're walking through.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.220]   So my favorite lit teacher in college, Clyde Kilby,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.220]   put it like this.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.800]   This is one of his resolutions for mental health.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.940]   I shall open my eyes and ears.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.640]   Once every day, I shall simply stare at a tree,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.960]   a flower, a cloud, or a person.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   I shall not then be concerned at all to ask what they are,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.040]   but simply be glad that they are.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.160]   I shall joyfully allow them the mystery
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.040]   of what Lewis calls their, quote,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.040]   "Divine, magical, terrifying, and ecstatic existence."
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.720]   So this afternoon, I'm walking back after chapel
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.240]   across my revelatory bridge,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   listening on my phone to the history of the Baptists,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.840]   and it hit me, turn that thing off.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   You can listen to that while you're brushing your teeth.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.280]   You are walking under God's blue sky.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.480]   Look up.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.400]   Look at those clouds, John.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.240]   Just look at 'em.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.980]   Let 'em minister to you.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.460]   You're inside all day long.
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.360]   You get 10 minutes under God's glory,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.720]   and you're gonna listen to a book?
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.560]   Much of our hypercritical bent is owing to the fact
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.440]   that our world has shrunk down to the tiny little situation
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.320]   where this molehill of a speck in a person's eye,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.920]   this molehill of a problem looks 100 times bigger
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   than it really is because we have made our world so small
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.120]   that this feels big.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.920]   We have focused our lens so narrowly
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.840]   that we can't see the glories all around us.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.040]   So that's number six.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.160]   Finally, number seven, fill your mind and your heart
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.800]   and your mouth with praise.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.760]   That's very much like thanks, but not quite the same.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.200]   Decades ago, I read this quote from C.S. Lewis.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.040]   Tony knows it.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.480]   Lots of you probably who are listening have heard this.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.840]   Let me say it again just 'cause it's so healing.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.880]   Oh my goodness, when I first read this,
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.380]   it just washed over me like a cleansing flood
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.400]   for how not to be a cranky person.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.000]   Here's what Lewis said about praise.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   "The most obvious fact about praise strangely escaped me.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.960]   I thought of it in terms of compliment,
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.560]   approval, the giving of honor.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.400]   I had never noticed that all enjoyment
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.600]   spontaneously overflows in praise.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.120]   The world rings with praise.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.240]   Lovers praising their mistresses,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.160]   readers, their favorite poet,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.560]   walkers praising the countryside,
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.380]   players praising their favorite game,
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.440]   praise of weather, wines, dishes, actors,
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.760]   motors, horses, colleges, countries,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.720]   historical personages, children, flowers,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.060]   mountains, rare stamps, rare beetles,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.020]   even sometimes politicians and scholars.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.180]   I had not noticed how the humblest
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.100]   and at the same time most balanced
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.060]   and capacious minds praised most
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.060]   while the cranks and the misfits and malcontents
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.100]   and may I add hypercritical types,
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.360]   INTJ types praised least."
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.100]   So there it is.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.860]   The remedy to not be a cranky,
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.860]   hypercritical misfit is to be full of praise.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.780]   So fix your eyes on God and the wonders
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.780]   of his creation and redemption and be filled with praise.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.020]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.320]   Excellent question, Alan.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.220]   Thank you for that.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.520]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.040]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.420]   You can search our growing archive
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.820]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.420]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.260]   Well, God can prevent every trial from entering our lives.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.660]   He can and he doesn't.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.220]   Why not?
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.740]   That's the question every believer must eventually answer,
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.420]   especially if you believe that God is all-powerful.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.420]   If he is, why does he allow trials into our lives?
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.700]   That's on the table next time.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.900]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.100]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.100]   Thanks for listening.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.260]   (upbeat music)
