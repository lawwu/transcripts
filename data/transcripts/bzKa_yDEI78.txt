[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.000]   are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5 and verse 19.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.600]   The 19th verse in the 5th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.000]   Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.800]   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.200]   Or as we saw last Sunday, it should be read speaking or addressing one another
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.000]   in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.400]   And what is going to engage us particularly this morning,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.600]   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   Now we are still continuing our consideration of the description
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.000]   which the apostle gives us here of how Christian people express the joy of salvation
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.200]   which they have in the Holy Ghost as they meet together as companies and as communities.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.000]   He is contrasting the kind of drunken orgies that the pagans and unbelievers
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.400]   indulge in with this convivial happy meeting together of Christian people.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   And last Sunday morning we saw how the apostle indicates to them
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:46.000]   how they should thus express the joy of salvation of which they are conscious within themselves.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But now as I say we come on to the second part of this verse, this statement.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.400]   Singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.600]   This is undoubtedly descriptive it seems to me of the way in which the psalms and hymns
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   and spiritual songs should be sung and expressed.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.400]   I don't believe that this is an additional exhortation that before he was talking about speaking only,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.200]   but now he comes to singing.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   I believe that this is an indication or an explanation of the way in which
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.600]   we should sing the psalms and the hymns and the spiritual songs.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Now this addition is a very necessary one as I think we shall see and a most important one
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.400]   because in any expression of praise we must concentrate attention not only upon the words
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.800]   but also upon the tune or the way in which the words are given this particular expression.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Now our whole emphasis last Sunday morning was on this,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.000]   that we should be very careful not to quench the spirit.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   That in our fear of excesses we shouldn't go to the other extreme and put a limit upon the free,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.400]   spontaneous, inspired expression of the Christian soul and spirit
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.600]   under the leadership and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.200]   But having done that we must now follow the apostle as he seems to me to put his emphasis
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.000]   upon the complementary truth.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600]   There are certain truths which must always go together.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.200]   And now we are going to look at the second half of this particular combination.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:55.600]   On the one hand quench not the spirit, but this morning let everything be done decently
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.800]   and in order and in a fitting and in a worthy manner.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.600]   In other words, yes, we must sing in psalms and hymns also and spiritual songs.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.800]   There must be no quenching of the spirit, no limit put upon the freedom of the spirit in that sense.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.600]   But as is always the great characteristic of the work of the spirit,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.200]   as we saw when we were dealing with the previous verse where he says,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.600]   "Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the spirit."
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   The glorious thing about the leadership of the spirit is this,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.200]   that at one and the same time he provides stimulus and control.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.800]   Wine doesn't do that, nothing else does that.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.600]   This is the unique characteristic of the work of the spirit, the stimulus, the life, the power,
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.800]   but always the control and the discipline.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.200]   Now then, it is to that aspect that we are going to call attention this morning.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.400]   We see at once what a wise teacher this great apostle was,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:10.200]   how well he knew all of us and how well he knew our danger of always going from one extreme right over to the other.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.800]   What a tragedy it is that we cannot keep the balance which the New Testament always observes.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.400]   In our fear of one thing we all go correct, go too far on the other side,
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   and we do that on both sides, but in the Scripture there is this perfect balance.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.600]   The complementary truth is always added to the first truth.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   Very well, now let's see what the apostle has got to tell us.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   "Making melody, singing," he says, "and making melody in your heart to the Lord."
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   Let's look at his terms.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.800]   Making melody.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.000]   What does this mean?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.200]   Well, its original meaning is to strike the lyre or to strike up a tune.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.000]   There is the lyre.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Well, he would strike up a tune on the lyre,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.600]   and so the meaning has come to this, that it's the striking up of a tune.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   But he doesn't stop at that. That's merely the original meaning.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.200]   And by now, and indeed throughout the centuries,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   and even in the time of the apostle, this term "melody" had a wider connotation.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.800]   And as the apostle exhorts us to make melody in our hearts to the Lord in our singing,
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.200]   it is important that we should be clear as to the meaning of the term "melody."
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   Here are some definitions given in the Oxford Dictionary, for instance.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.800]   Sweet music. Listen to another.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.600]   Beautiful arrangement of musical sounds.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.000]   Beauty of musical sounds.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.600]   Tunefulness.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   The air.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.800]   Now, it is important that we should realize that because
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.600]   I am arguing that what the apostle is doing here is to give us a definition
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   of what is always and invariably the characteristic of Christian music.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.800]   And as he's dealing with this whole question, with how we conduct ourselves in the church,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.000]   and when we meet together to worship and to praise God,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   it is most important, as I think we shall see, that we should be clear about this.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.800]   He says, "Making melody in your hearts unto the Lord."
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:45.000]   Now then, here is to be the characteristic always of Christian music.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.400]   Now, there is such a thing as Christian music, as there is Christian poetry, as there is Christian art.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.000]   And I have a feeling that one of the great troubles in the church today
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.200]   is that we have forgotten the definition of these things
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.800]   and have tended foolishly to go in for art's sake.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.600]   "Melody," says the apostle. What does he mean?
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   Well, let me tell you what he doesn't mean.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.400]   He is saying that the way in which Christians express their praise
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:25.800]   or sing their psalms and hymns and spiritual songs is not by clever music.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.000]   Cleverness is never the characteristic of Christian music, indeed, or of anything Christian.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.800]   Cleverness belongs essentially to the world.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.600]   You see why I'm saying this?
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.800]   You are aware of the modern vogue, not only in music, but in art and in poetry.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   The idea today is that you mustn't be melodious.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.600]   You must be clever. Melody is out of fashion.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:06.200]   What is rarely admired today is a sort of series and collection of clashing discords.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.000]   Not, as we read in our definition, a beautiful arrangement of musical sounds,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.200]   but apparently a deliberate attempt to make it not beautiful, but then it's clever.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   People despise melody today. They don't like poetry, the poetry that people used to like.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.800]   They are not interested in rhymes and in balance and in lines.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.600]   It must be jerky, staccato.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   The beautiful element seems to be at a serious discount.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.800]   Tunefulness is despised. You can read all this.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.000]   You read the critics and you'll find that—you read the musical critics in the paper,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and you'll find that they tend to despise anything tuneful and melodious.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   It's this clever, clashing, cacophonous music that is popular at the present time.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.800]   Well, what I'm concerned to emphasize is this, that that is not Christian.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.600]   What is Christian is always beautiful.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   It is always melodious. It always leads to peace, to harmony, to rest, and to joy.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.800]   Obviously, because it is something that is produced by the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.400]   "Be filled," he says, "with the Spirit."
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.800]   Those other people with their bacchanalian songs and so on,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:40.000]   you can expect all kinds of noises and clashes and discords. It's horrible.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.200]   But it's not Christian. That's his whole point.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.800]   Christian is the exact opposite.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:51.400]   What is Christian is always tuneful, always melodious,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   always has this form and this beauty as its most essential characteristic.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.600]   And as I say, this is not only true of Christian music,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.800]   but it is true of Christian art in every form and in its every expression.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.600]   Now, I am arguing that it is very important that the Christian church should realize this,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.400]   and that she must stand in opposition to the ugliness
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.800]   that is so evident in the worldly conception of art today,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.400]   in all ranges and in every department.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.600]   The characteristic of the Christian is that it is a melody.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.400]   It isn't merely clever.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   It isn't merely an opportunity for people to show their cleverness in execution
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.800]   and to go out of their way, as it were, to avoid melody,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.600]   and not to put the note you'd expect, but deliberately the wrong one,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:58.200]   so as to keep it always in some state of flux and deliberately to avoid beauty of form.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.800]   Very well. It is to be melody and therefore not just merely clever.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:13.000]   That's the world with its barren intellectualism and its hardness and its coldness.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.600]   This is so evident in the modern world that it is our duty to go out of our way to counteract this
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   and to show the beauty, the harmony, and the peace and the joy that belong to Christian praise.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.000]   But let me suggest another negative.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.800]   I start with cleverness because it is the most obvious one in the world today,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.400]   but it isn't the only one.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.000]   That which is a true melody is never merely light or flippant,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.400]   or what is called jiggy, syncopated.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:58.000]   Now, the world likes that kind of thing, light and flippant music,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.800]   but that's never Christian.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.400]   Whatever is Christian cannot be light. It's impossible.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.000]   Whatever is Christian is always essentially simple,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.600]   but simplicity is not incompatible with depth.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.400]   Indeed, they generally go together.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:26.000]   So the apostle is telling us here that we must always sing these psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.600]   in this melodious manner, not in any light or flippant, not in the worldly way,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.200]   not just being carried along by something superficial.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.000]   There is no term that is being so abused today as this word "melody."
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.800]   Sometimes you hear it on the wireless when you're waiting for something better.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:55.000]   You hear these people crooning and droning and using the word "melody" of all words.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   What a foul perversion of a beautiful and a glorious term.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.200]   It's never light, I say, never flippant, never showy, never theatrical.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.000]   That's incompatible with melody, as it is incompatible with Christianity.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.800]   The apostle's concerned about all this.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.600]   These people have become Christians, yes, but they're not absolutely perfect yet,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.400]   and they tend to do certain things in the old way and manner.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.200]   His whole emphasis is, "You must stop doing it like that.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   You must do this in the Christian way."
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.400]   And this is the essence of the Christian way.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.600]   So my last negative is this.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.800]   It must never be done in a sentimental manner.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.600]   The term, rather, is the term "melody."
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.000]   Well, let me sum it up like this.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.800]   The apostle is really saying that as we thus sing praise to God,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.400]   we must do it in a manner that is worthy of, or suited to,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.000]   or to use an expression which he uses in writing to the Philippians.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   He says in Philippians 1, 27, "Only let your conversation be,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.400]   as it becometh the gospel of Christ."
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.200]   That's it. It must be becoming.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.600]   It must be suitable. It must fit in.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.400]   It must all be one of a piece and one of a pattern.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.800]   You can't have great and glorious words and a jiggy tune,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.600]   or a sentimental tune.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   "Now," says the apostle, "if you," he says, "are filled with the Spirit
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.400]   and are allowing the Spirit to lead you and to guide you and to direct you,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.200]   well, then there'll be no trouble about this at all.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.600]   Because He who gives the word will also give the music.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.800]   He will give you the air, the tune, everything you want,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.200]   and everything will be suited and fitting,
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   will be matched together in a manner that is perfect."
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.600]   Well, now there is the first part of our consideration
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.800]   of this additional statement of the apostle.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   We are to make melody, my friends.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.400]   We are not to be devotees of this modern craze for ugliness,
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.000]   for mere cleverness.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   The Christian man is never a merely clever man.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.800]   And if any preacher of the gospel, myself included,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.200]   gives an impression of cleverness, oh, it is bad preaching.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.600]   It is so unlike the New Testament.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:27.200]   It is so unlike that which is inspired and produced by the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.400]   No, no, there is a fitness here, there is a form, there is a suitability.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.600]   It must always correspond to that about which we are concerned.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.800]   But let's go on with his definition.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   "Making melody," he says, "in your hearts."
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   Now, this isn't just something thrown in, this isn't just an accidental word.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.000]   What does he mean?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.400]   Well, let's be clear about, again, what he doesn't mean.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.800]   He doesn't mean that you should do this privately, secretly, or inwardly.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.000]   Some people have thought he is saying that, but the whole context is against that.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.600]   He is dealing here with Christians in community.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   He is not concerned to tell them here what they do when they are alone.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.800]   He is emphasizing what they do as they gather together.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.400]   I say, the contrast is with the gatherings of these other people who met to drink wine
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.200]   and to have their sing sung, and to have what they thought was a happy and a jolly time together.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's the contrast, Christians in community.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.800]   So, it isn't a man in the innermost part of his being, in his heart, privately, secretly,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   making melody and singing prayers to God.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   But I think it is equally important that we should realize this, that he doesn't mean heartily.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   Now, many have got confused and have thought that he is saying that,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.400]   as if he were saying, as we hear so much these days,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.600]   "Now then, speak to yourselves, let's sing together our psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.000]   singing and making melody heartily."
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.200]   You are familiar with the exhortation.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.400]   Now, I'm going to try to show you that, indeed, he not only does not mean that,
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.000]   he almost means the exact opposite of that.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.200]   He says, "In your hearts," not heartily.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.400]   Heartily is something which is very different, as I shall show you.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   And so, once more, he doesn't mean sentimentally.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.600]   There are people who seem to think that that should be the characteristic, always, of Christian praise.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.200]   It should be something sentimental.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.800]   We are familiar with such words and with such tunes, but that's not Christianity.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   That doesn't conform with this idea of melody,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.000]   nor does it conform with singing and making melody in your hearts.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Well, what does he mean? Well, he means this.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.400]   He says, "You must be controlled in this respect by the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   In the very center of your being."
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.600]   The heart, here, as so often and generally, indeed, in the Bible,
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   includes not merely the seat of the immersions, it includes that, but it goes beyond that.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.800]   It includes the whole man.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   Singing and making melody in your heart.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.400]   What's his contrast? Well, the contrast is this.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.200]   That we must realize what we are doing.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.600]   We must be well aware of what we are singing.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.000]   Now, those people in their drunken meetings, they're not interested in anything.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   They don't think at all. They can't think.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And they just shout and sing.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.400]   And that's their idea of making themselves happy.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.800]   And the more they sing and the more they shout,
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.200]   the more they become intoxicated and the worse and worse it gets.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.800]   Now, the Christian is the exact opposite of that.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:59.400]   He sings and makes melody in his heart.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.000]   And the heart includes the understanding.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.600]   In other words, he says, this Christian praise is thoughtful.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.000]   You as Christians, he says, led by the Spirit,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.400]   you realize that you're in the presence of God
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.600]   and that you are singing praise unto God
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.600]   and that you are there to show forth God's glory
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.200]   and to glorify and magnify his great and his holy name.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.600]   That's what he means.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   Our Lord himself, of course, put it to the woman of Samaria.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.200]   He said, God is Spirit and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and in truth.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.000]   It isn't this mountain, it isn't Jerusalem, it isn't forms and ceremonies.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.800]   It's a matter of the Spirit.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.400]   That's precisely what the apostle is saying.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   You are filled with the Spirit and the Spirit enlightens your heart.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:58.000]   And that includes your mind, your understanding, your reason.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.200]   You don't merely sing, he says, you realize what you're doing
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.000]   and you're careful and you're thoughtful, you're meditative.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.600]   It's a very intelligent type of singing.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.000]   Well, you notice that in that psalm which I read to you at the beginning,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.600]   the psalmist put emphasis upon the same thing.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.800]   Listen to him in Psalm 47.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.600]   Sing praises to God, sing praises, sing praises unto our King, sing praises,
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.800]   for God is the King of all the earth.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.400]   Sing ye praises with understanding.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.000]   The understanding is involved always in every action of the Christian.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.400]   This, to me, is a very wonderful statement that we're looking at this morning.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   You see, what it's bringing out everywhere is this,
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.800]   that the Christian knows what he's doing always.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   The Christian is never thoughtless.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.400]   The Christian is never to be unintelligent.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.000]   Whatever the Christian does, this element of reason, understanding, thought,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.400]   is an essential part of it.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   Because he is a man who's been enlightened, he's no longer a fool,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   he's wise, he knows what he's doing.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.800]   And he's not to be guided by anybody else.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.200]   It doesn't matter how great a musician a man is, if he's not a Christian, I don't listen to him.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.800]   I'm not interested in his opinion.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.000]   He cannot give an opinion on Christian praise.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.200]   He may know all about the mechanics of music, but that isn't Christian praise.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.600]   This is something peculiar, and it is governed by this Christian understanding
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.200]   that is given to us as the result of being filled with the Spirit.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:41.400]   But, of course, it isn't confined only to the intellect and to the understanding.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   It also means that the man does it with feeling.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   It isn't to be done mechanically.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.200]   It isn't to be a dull mechanical repetition.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.000]   "Now," says the apostle, "if you are filled with the Spirit,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.600]   why, there will be love and joy within you,
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.800]   and you'll be anxious to express this, you'll be anxious to manifest this.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.000]   And so you will be singing with the whole of your being,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.'"
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.200]   Not the mind only, not the feelings only,
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.400]   because then it becomes modeling sentimentality.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.800]   But the glory of the Christian position is this,
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.400]   because the mind and the heart are engaged, well, then it is true melody.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.200]   It is singing praise unto the Lord in a worthy and in a fitting manner.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:44.600]   Well, now then, there, it seems to me, is the essential definition of what the apostle is saying.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.000]   But let us proceed to try to apply this in practice.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.200]   What is it, then, we have to do?
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.400]   The first deduction I would make is this,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.000]   that as we consider this whole question of Christian praise,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.800]   and we should, we are exalted to do it,
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.600]   we take part in it, therefore we must have understanding about this.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.200]   What must we be careful about? Well, here is the first thing.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.400]   We must ever remember that we are not to sing the tunes only.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:24.200]   The moment we do that, we've already departed from the apostle's instruction.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   The words come first, and the words are more important than the tune.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:36.400]   And what we have, of course, is this, the, we have the words and the tune coming together,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:43.800]   married and blended together in order to give expression to this praise.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.000]   But there is nothing that is quite so fatal as to be singing the tune only,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and paying no attention whatsoever to the words.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.400]   Now, let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:01.200]   There is nothing that so appalls me, I think I can say quite truthfully,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.800]   in preaching here and elsewhere,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.400]   than to hear what almost invariably happens when we sing that great hymn,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   "Jesus, Lover of my Soul."
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.800]   You come to that third verse, and the second half goes like this,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.000]   "Just and holy is thy name, I am all unrighteousness,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:35.200]   Vile and full of sin I am, Thou art full of truth and grace."
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:44.000]   It is almost an invariable rule that people shout the whole of that statement,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.800]   "I am all unrighteousness, vile and full of sin I am."
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   They shout it as if they're glaring at it,
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.400]   even more than when they come to the last line, "Thou art full of truth and grace."
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.000]   Why do we do that? Well, I'll tell you why we do it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.400]   It's because we are carried away by the tune.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.000]   We are not paying attention to the words. We don't think what we are singing.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.200]   Here's a tune that goes well, and we are carried away by the tune,
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.000]   and we shout out these words. Let me give you another illustration.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.600]   There is a well-known chorus with the beginning, "God is still on the throne."
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.400]   Do you recall the tune to which it's generally sung?
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.600]   I wouldn't hesitate to assert that it is blasphemous.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.000]   A light and a jiggy tune about God still on the throne.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.600]   And it's jigged along lightly, they trip it lightly.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   "God is still on the throne."
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.400]   No, no, that means, you see, that we have been carried away by the tune,
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.000]   and that we are not paying any attention whatsoever to the words that we are singing.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:04.200]   Now I want to put a problem to you for your consideration.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:11.000]   Is it ever right, you think, to divorce the singing of hymns,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.800]   or any expression of Christian praise and of worship, from the preaching of the Word?
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.600]   You know that as Protestants we have always fought that battle,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   as over against the Roman Catholics, Anglo-Catholics, and all other Catholics,
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.200]   that the sacraments should never be separated from the Word.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.400]   That is the characteristic always of Catholicism.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   The sacraments are divorced from the Word,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.000]   so you can go and take the sacrament in a service where the Word is not preached.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It's a service for sacrament only.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.500]   Now, Protestantism has always, rightly, undoubtedly, in the light of the Scripture,
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.700]   protested against it.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.200]   And I am asking you whether you don't agree
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.400]   that the same thing should apply to the singing of hymns, carols,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   anything that is designed to express Christian praise and worship.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.000]   I am more and more interested and concerned about this.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.400]   I was brought up in an atmosphere in which we had what were called singing festivals,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:24.200]   in which you spent a whole day in singing hymns, learning new ones, and so on.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:30.000]   I wonder whether that is really justifiable in the light of the Apostles' teaching.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Does it not become the case inevitably that the tunes become more important than the words?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.200]   "I know," they say, "but we open the service with a reading of Scripture and a prayer,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.600]   and a word is given now and again." But is that enough?
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.800]   Should you have a service which consists almost entirely of singing,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.000]   I am of the opinion that the Apostle Paul would say no to that.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.800]   I don't care whether you're singing carols or whatever else you're singing.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.000]   The singing must never be the main part of the meeting.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.800]   It is a part, but it isn't a whole. It must never have this prominence.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.400]   It must never be divorced from the word at any rate.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:12.000]   If you're going to do that, it must be made perfectly plain and clear each time exactly what you're singing.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And the men responsible for the meeting, in my opinion, should read the words and comment upon them,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.600]   and urge upon the people the realization of what they're going to sing.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   Now, of course, the end of all this is what we are all familiar with at any rate from the newspapers.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   You know how every year when they have the final match, I believe, of the football association,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:42.200]   it is now the tradition for that great concourse of people to sing "Abide With Me."
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.000]   Are they interested in the words, in the sentiments? No, no, they're interested in the tune.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.600]   "And there are men singing 'Abide With Me'; first falls the even tide, 'Hold thou thy cross,' etc."
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.800]   Who don't believe in the cross, not interested in the cross, and are not thinking about it,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.000]   even as they're uttering the words from their mouths.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Well, now, there is the extreme, of course, outside the church.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   What I'm suggesting is that inside the church, we are often guilty of the same excess, the same kind of error.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.400]   Let me put this to you in some words that were written by the great Saint Augustine.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   Saint Augustine felt that there was strength and inspiration in hymn singing, but he said this,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:36.000]   "I perceive that our minds are more devoutly and earnestly elevated into a flame of piety
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.400]   by the holy words themselves when they are sung than when they are not,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   and that all affections of our spirit, by their own diversity, have their appropriate measures
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:55.600]   in the voice and singing, wherewith, by I know not what relationship, they are stimulated."
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.400]   What he means is this, that he has discovered that singing does help
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   to kindle the flame of piety and of devotion within us, that when the words are sung,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.400]   they are more likely to have that effect upon us than when they are merely spoken or recited.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   And yet, you know, this must be added.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   Saint Augustine feared the subtle beguilement of sweet sounds and wished at times
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   that they could be banished both from his ears and from the church singing.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   And he put it like this, "When it happens to me to be more moved by the singing than by what is sung,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   I confess myself to have sinned criminally, and then I would rather not have heard the singing."
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   I think that's perfect.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   You see the balance.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   He says, "Yes, singing is a great help. It's a great stimulus.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   It helps to bring out the spirit of devotion and of worship and of praise.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   There is a great advantage in it."
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   And yet, he says, "We've got to be careful always of this subtle danger,
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   the danger of being more impressed by the tune than by the words,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   carried away by the tune and forgetting the words."
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   "You know, when that happens to me," says Augustine, "I feel that I've sinned criminally,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   and I wish that I'd never sung at all."
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.400]   He was afraid of this beguilement of a beautiful tune.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   And there is no question at all but that he there is giving a perfect expression
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   to the teaching of the apostle that we are considering together this morning.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:44.400]   Singing and making melody in your heart, the balance, the mind, the words, the understanding,
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   as well as the tune.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   "The moment," says Augustine, "I'm carried away by the tune and beguiled by it, I feel I've sinned."
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   Something has come in that is really not a part of the leading of the spirit.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   Well, let us go on to another deduction.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.400]   "It's all here, you see, be filled with the spirit,
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord."
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   Not the tune only, I say, but also this.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   Not a false and forced excitement of the nerves or of the emotion.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   That is why I said just now that he doesn't mean that we should sing heartily.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:41.400]   Now, this which the apostle is recommending is the exact opposite of excitement.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   An excitable and a forced and a generated nervous condition of the emotions.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   The apostle is saying the exact opposite of that.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   So that when he tells us to sing and make melody in our hearts to the Lord,
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   he is incidentally saying this, "Don't sing too much."
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   In other words, he is saying, "Above everything,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   don't try to work up the meeting by 40 minutes or so of preliminary singing."
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   He is saying that quite deliberately.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.400]   Now, that is the modern idea, isn't it?
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   We say we must work up the meeting.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   We must get the people into a good mood and into a good condition.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.400]   In other words, we are deliberately doing something to their nerves, to their emotions.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   We are making a direct attack upon the emotions,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   trying by means of our singing to work them up.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   Now, the apostle is saying the very exact opposite of that, as I'll show you.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   There mustn't then be too much singing, because you can become drunk on singing.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   You can go on singing and singing until, well, you are in such an emotional state
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.400]   that your mind is no longer operating.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   I've often seen that happen.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   I wonder whether what the apostle teaches is compatible with the modern popular song leader
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   who jumps into a pulpit or onto a rostrum and cracks a few jokes just to put people into a good mood.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   This is the exact opposite, my friends.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:15.400]   This is the leadership of the Holy Spirit making melody in your hearts.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.400]   But how often is this done?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   I remember an occasion just as an illustration.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   I went to a meeting when I was on holiday.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   It was held in a huge tent, and here came the man at the very beginning to conduct.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   He made his jokes and laughed, and then, I remember, he said, and it produced a great laughter,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   he said, "Now, let it rip!"
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   Then, I didn't mean the tent, of course, and that's good.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   "Yes, well, all right, you laugh at it, but you know we should weep at this.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   This is something to be wept at."
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   They were singing hymns, hymns of praise unto God, hymns of worship and of adoration.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   That's what happens in the drunken orgy, the joke and the laughter, and the joviality, so-called.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   But this is in the Spirit, making melody in your heart and to the Lord.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   Then there are others who believe in working up a meeting by means of hand-clapping.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   "Do you denounce that?" says someone.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   "Didn't that 47th Psalm, which you read at the beginning, start by making this very statement,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   'O clap your hands, all ye people!
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   Shout unto God with the voice of triumph!'"
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   Well, it seems to me the answer is this.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   You are so filled with the Spirit and so moved by the Spirit
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   that you find yourself involuntarily clapping your hands all is well.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   But that's the exact opposite of clapping your hands in order to work yourself up into a state of excitement
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   and get everybody else worked up.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   When you're exhorted in that way, mechanically, to clap your hands and stamp your feet
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   and beat on some tambourine or something in order to work up feelings and excitement,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   that's the exact opposite of what the Apostle is saying.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.400]   If I say you are so filled with joy, well, then it's all right, it's of the Spirit, but not otherwise.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:21.400]   And again, in the same way, we must be careful as to what musical instruments we use.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   There are musical instruments that are sensuous, that belong to the world.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   They have no place in Christian worship.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   Saxophones and things of that type, they don't belong to this realm.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   They are essentially of the world and primitive,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   not the thoughtfulness and the wisdom that characterizes the Christian.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   In other words, let me sum up this section in this way.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   The Apostle is not saying that we should sing until we make ourselves happy.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   He is saying this.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   Express the happiness that you already feel because of the work of the Spirit in you by singing.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   You see, we've reversed all this.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   We say, "Now these people have come to the meeting, they're jaded and they're tired.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   Now then, we've got to get them up, we've worked them up, we've got to get them into a good mood."
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   And so we sing and sing and sing, and we do it with all the accompaniments and all the modern trappings,
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   and then we get them into a good mood.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.400]   The Apostle says, "Look here, because you are filled with the Spirit,
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   and because He has shed this joy abroad in your hearts,
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.400]   give expression to it by psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   making melody in your heart unto the Lord."
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   And so I come to my last deduction, which is this.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   Indeed, it's an emphasis.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   You notice that the Apostle addresses these words to all, to all Christians, not to some Christians.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   "Here you are," he says, "you've gathered together, you Christian people.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:54.400]   Well now then, speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   Join together in singing and making melody in your hearts."
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   We are all in this. This is Christian praise.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   You see, it isn't a choir only,
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   with all the congregation just sitting and listening to the beautiful singing of the choir.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   You know, that's almost the exact opposite of what the Apostle is saying.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   That's what we've come to.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   The choir only sings, and still worse, of course, when it's a paid choir.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:28.400]   And still worse, when the members of the paid choir, of the special quartet in it,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   are not even Christians, but are brought in because they've got good voices.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   And sometimes in certain countries, only arrive at the service just in time when they've got to sing,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   and leave immediately afterwards.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   That happens in the Christian church today, very commonly.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   Not so common in this country as in some countries, but it happens very commonly in this country.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   That is, I say, the opposite of what the Apostle is saying.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   Here are God's people met together, filled with the Spirit.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   And they all take part, because they all are sharers of the same Spirit and participators in Him.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   So far, you see, we've departed from the New Testament pattern.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   With your great, dignified, cathedral service,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:22.400]   only the choir singing, nobody else venturing or daring to do so.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   How can we forget the New Testament to such an extent?
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   We're all in this, my friends.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   And if you don't sing, there's something the matter with you.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   Why don't you sing? Don't you want to? Don't you want to praise God?
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:41.400]   All of you, says the Apostle, mingle your voices, join together.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   But I would also emphasize this, that we must all do it together.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   You see, it is because of excesses that people have gone to the extreme of choirs only.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   But that's not the answer. The extreme is never the answer.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   There is a right way for a congregation to sing. And what is that?
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   Well, sing together, says Paul, making melody.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   This is where the harmony comes in. This is where the balance and the control comes in.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   How do we do it? Well, this is the way.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   You don't behave in congregational singing as a soloist.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   A soloist is meant to sing alone, but not when you're in a congregation.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.400]   The whole ideal and glory of a congregation singing is that there is this balance, this wholeness.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   They're all one. There are no voices standing out above the others.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:39.400]   That's destroying this element of harmony, which is to accompany this beautiful melody.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.400]   And for people to display their personal voices when a congregation is singing
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   is a complete denial of the Apostle's instruction.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   But that sort of thing is done, isn't it?
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   It's a great temptation to have a good voice.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   You can show it by starting the line before everybody else,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.400]   or you can do it by holding out at the end when everybody else has finished,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   and your voice is heard in all its beauty and its glory.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:15.400]   Yes, but you see, that destroys the whole spirit of the thing that the Apostle is saying.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   He says, "Look here, you all do this together, not to show your voice, not to display yourself,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   and thereby cause irritation to everybody else who's round and about you."
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   If you've got a great and powerful voice, well, moderate it when you're with others.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   Otherwise you will be upsetting people and disturbing the harmony.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   He says, "Look here, you are to be guided and led by the Spirit."
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   And what is the Spirit? What are the fruits of the Spirit?
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   Well, love, joy, peace, peacefulness.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   Nothing that jars or irritates anybody else.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   No self-display, no standing out.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   You become merged in the body, you do it all together.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   Long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   which is the opposite, you see, of showing your voice and being proud of it.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   Meekness.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   And finally, temperance, which means self-control.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   A man says, "I've got such a great and powerful voice."
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.400]   Control the voice.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   "I've got wonderful breath control, I can go on."
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   Well, don't do it if others don't.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   Temperance, self-control.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.400]   We are all one here.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   Isn't it a wonderful thing I say that the Apostle should have written all this?
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   Do you know it's tremendously important, my friends?
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.400]   Are you sensitive to these things? I confess that I am.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   And very often when I'm in this pulpit,
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   people who fail to realize the Apostle's teaching in this way
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   are a hindrance to my preaching.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   They are a hindrance to my spirit.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   You're aware of these departings from the presiding glory of the Holy Spirit
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   and the meekness and the temperance and the peace
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   and all these other glorious things that he always produces.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   In other words, everything we do in these gatherings in God's house is important.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   We are met together to praise God and to worship him and to adore him.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   What a terrible thing if we should go away having done nothing but give reign
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   to our mere emotions and animal part of our being.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   What if we should but have displayed ourselves, our cleverness, our ability, our voice, or anything else?
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   No, no, it's the exact opposite of all that.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   Don't be like those drunken people.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.400]   They keep on interrupting one another.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.400]   Each one wants to show that he is better than everybody else,
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   displaying himself, boasting himself.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   "You are not like that," says Paul.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   "You are not filled with wine, wherein is excess.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   You are filled with the Spirit."
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   And therefore what characterizes your meetings is this peace,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   this melody, this harmony,
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   this meekness, this self-control,
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   this balance, this concern about the whole body,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.400]   this concern about the glory of God,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   giving thanks always for all things and of God and the Father
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.400]   Well, there it is.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   This is the kind of sermon that a man would never have decided to preach or have chosen to preach.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   If you've learned nothing else this morning,
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   I trust that you've learned this,
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   the wisdom of working systematically through a book of the Bible,
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   not picking out text here and there.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   Have you ever heard a sermon on this before?
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   You probably haven't.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   These are the things that we ignore, you see.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   And so in practice the Christian church is often denying her own belief
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.400]   and has departed from the New Testament pattern to such an extent
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   that you rarely can scarcely recognize it as being the same church.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   Oh, I would repeat, quench not the Spirit in your fear of the excesses of hymn singing and so on.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   Don't quench the Spirit.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   But on the other hand, let us be careful that everything in the realm of the freedom of the Spirit
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   be done decently, in order, with temperance, with self-control.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:43.400]   For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   and of a sound mind of discipline.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   May God enable us, therefore, in all we do, whatever gift you've got,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   whether of song or of speech or of poetry or of art, oh, let it be Christian.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   Let the element of beauty, of harmony, of peace, the line,
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   this glorious perfection of the Spirit, let it be manifest in all that we do,
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   that it may ever be to the praise of the glory of His grace.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   Amen.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
