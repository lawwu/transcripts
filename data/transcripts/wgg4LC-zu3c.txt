[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.360]   We recorded these episodes early
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.960]   because by airtime, Pastor John,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.620]   you will not be in your office in Minnesota,
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.880]   but you will be, Lord willing,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.860]   ministering somewhere in Hong Kong,
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.400]   and you'll be there between May 20th and 26th,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.960]   and then from there, you go on to Korea,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.040]   and you minister there between May 26th and June 1st.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.400]   These are some amazing opportunities ahead,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.080]   so we would love to ask for everyone
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.120]   to join in praying for this trip.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.320]   These international trips are priceless opportunities
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440]   for us to get the message of Christian hedonism
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.040]   to new audiences, of course,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.480]   who have never heard before the truth
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.200]   that God is most glorified in us
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.280]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000]   And if you financially support DesiringGod.org,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   you make trips like this one possible.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.560]   So we're grateful to God for you,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.760]   for your sacrifices,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.800]   and for your ongoing prayers of support
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.040]   on behalf of Pastor John.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440]   Well, today's question's fairly common,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680]   and this time it comes to us from an anonymous listener
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.040]   who simply asks this, Pastor John,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.960]   have you ever thought about releasing a commentary
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.040]   on the whole Bible?
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.320]   I know a few pastors have done it,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.580]   and I'm not saying that every pastor should do it,
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.320]   but since you release a good amount of content
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.480]   like books, articles, sermons, and podcasts,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.460]   I've wondered if you plan on releasing a commentary
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.920]   on the Bible or on certain books.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.280]   You seem capable.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.560]   And what would make a great Bible commentary
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.860]   in your opinion?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   - The closest things I have done to a commentary
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.520]   is to preach through books of the Bible,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.480]   and then post those manuscripts along with the audio
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.320]   or the video online at Desiring God.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.080]   So for example, there's 250 sermons on Romans
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.760]   and a few other books that I did over the years.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   That's the closest thing.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.680]   I mean, if you read every one of those sermons,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.360]   that would be my commentary on Romans.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.080]   Recently, I did, I finished about 100
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.360]   Look at the Book podcasts on 1 Peter,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.040]   taking it a verse or two at a time,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.800]   and talking my way through the meaning of the text,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.040]   mainly with a visual teaching aid
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860]   called Look at the Book online,
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.860]   to try to help people see how I get meaning out of texts.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.120]   Now, this may sound strange coming from a preacher
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.480]   who spent over three decades of his life
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.580]   heralding the meaning of text,
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.280]   but there is a strong bent in me
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.240]   that wants to help people be able to find the meaning
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.720]   of text for themselves,
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.400]   rather than me just telling them what it is.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.980]   I know preachers do tell meanings,
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.620]   but I've got this bent that I want people to see
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.740]   how to get it for themselves,
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.460]   even in the way I preached.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.900]   And I was trying to do that.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.140]   I was trying to show meaning in a way
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.900]   that people would see, how did he get that?
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300]   Where did that come from?
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.460]   Show me the very words and the logic.
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.340]   And if I didn't help them see that,
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.720]   I felt the sermon was weak,
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.040]   that they were gonna then take my word for it
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.000]   instead of seeing it in the very words of scripture.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.240]   So even in the way I preached,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.600]   I had this bent that I wanted mainly,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.380]   I don't know if the word mainly is right here,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.380]   but strongly to see how to get meaning for themselves.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.080]   So that bent of mind has led me
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.520]   to do Look at the Book podcast,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.360]   which strives to help people see how to get meaning
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.280]   from text rather than just be spoon-fed the meaning of text.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.800]   And I suppose there is a kind of commentary
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.760]   that would put the emphasis
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.520]   on helping people find the meaning themselves.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.180]   That's the kind I would want to write
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.080]   if I wrote a commentary,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.520]   because there's a deep conviction behind this,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.320]   namely that over the long haul,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.080]   strong Christians are created
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.460]   not by sermons and by books alone,
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.640]   but by a personal encounter with the word of God,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.760]   the Bible itself.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.280]   So I want to encourage people to linger long enough
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.800]   over the scriptures themselves and ask enough questions
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.840]   and look at things from enough angles
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   and spend enough brain power and pour out enough prayers
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.360]   that they make amazing and true discoveries
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.340]   for themselves from the text.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.060]   This is what makes spindly,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.060]   cattail Christians into oaks of righteousness.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.100]   It sends our roots down into the granite foundations
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.820]   of biblical truth so that we stop being flip-floppy,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.860]   blown around in the winds kind of Christians
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.700]   who are always learning
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.900]   and never coming to knowledge of the truth.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.980]   Turns them into oaks of righteousness
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.460]   'cause they can see,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.180]   they can see for themselves what's really there
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.020]   in the precious, inspired word of God.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.840]   So I don't know.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   I don't know whether I will write a commentary,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.580]   but if I wrote a commentary,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.580]   I would like to write one that forces questions of reality.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.860]   This is kind of a second point
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.540]   besides helping people see for themselves,
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.580]   but a way of understanding,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.180]   forces questions of reality.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.620]   Sometimes these questions are called application,
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.260]   like, "Oh, we need some application in the commentary."
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.620]   I think that's misleading, given what I'm after,
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.580]   because it assumes that we've got the meaning down
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.340]   and we understand the reality spoken of,
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.660]   and what we need is just connect it
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.740]   with something in our lives.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.020]   Well, I think very often we are using,
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.020]   even commentators are using biblical words and phrases
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.620]   as if we know what we're talking about
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.660]   when we haven't really paused to ponder very deeply,
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.780]   "What's the reality?
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.780]   "The reality, reality of the words and phrases?
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.420]   "What are we referring to?"
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.860]   Give you an example.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.420]   1 Peter 2, verse one goes like this.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.100]   "Put away all malice and all deceit
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.380]   "and hypocrisy and envy and all slander."
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.380]   Now, the average commentary moves fairly quickly
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.380]   over these five realities,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.380]   malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander,
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.300]   but in my way of looking at the scriptures,
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   each one of those requires hours, hours,
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.580]   H-O-U-R-S, of reflection about the very nature
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.100]   of the experience in the human heart.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.980]   What is malice?
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.060]   Why is it something that's malicious?
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.620]   That is, why is something malice?
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.820]   How is it different from the others in the list?
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.180]   How does it relate to God?
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.340]   How does it relate to the devil?
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.060]   How does it relate to my personality?
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.060]   Is it present in people who are genetically nice?
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.260]   Is it a serious problem if people never act on it?
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.580]   How does it fit in the list?
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.220]   Why is it listed first and on and on and on?
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.540]   This takes 10, 15 pages.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.500]   No commentary does that,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.420]   and I don't think I'm gonna write it,
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.660]   but I'm just pleading with people to ask reality questions
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.300]   and to take a pen in hand or get on the computer
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.660]   and start mauling and pondering and asking
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.980]   and thinking to go down into reality.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.540]   Most commentaries simply don't have the time
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.220]   or perhaps the inclination to ask
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.900]   these kinds of reality questions,
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.900]   and yet, in my experience, this is the kind of rumination,
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.220]   like a cow chewing the cud for hours,
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.380]   swallowing it, spitting it back up from another stomach
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.820]   and chewing it again, swallowing it,
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.180]   spitting it up, chewing it again,
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.580]   however that works with cows.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.180]   It's good, good analogy.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.460]   Rumination is the most life-changing
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.620]   for us and for preachers.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.420]   Oh, preachers, this is what your people need you to do.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.780]   Not just fly over that list.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.140]   Take a week on malice.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.660]   Take a week on deceit.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.500]   Take a week on hypocrisy and think your way
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.180]   into the depths of evil that are named there.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.380]   So I suppose there would be two things
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.420]   that would characterize the commentary I would write.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.340]   In summary, one, it would try to inculcate
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.220]   a pattern of asking and answering questions
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.580]   that enable people to see things for themselves,
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.500]   and secondly, it would try to inculcate
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.780]   the habit of probing for reality,
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.860]   not just verbal relations.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.700]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John, much appreciated.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.260]   They are not commentaries per se, but close,
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.100]   and I'm talking to the over 2,000 sermons
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.900]   from John Piper on our site right now
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.020]   at desiringgod.org/messages.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.500]   You can find the popular Roman series there as well.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.700]   It's in that collection.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.780]   And this is my chance to let you know
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.340]   you can subscribe to our audio feeds
