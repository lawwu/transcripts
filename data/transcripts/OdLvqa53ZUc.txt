[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Hello. I'm here with Ravi. Ravi, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.040]   Yes. I am Pastor Ravi, a missionary from India. And I came to Shepherds Conference first time.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.960]   And I'm working among the slums in the villages and in the slums in Vijayawada.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.040]   Oh, great. And Ravi, you've been reading the Legacy Standard Bible. What do you think?
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.280]   Yeah. I got this from my friend, and I was studying. I had so many versions. Like, you
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.960]   know, I have NLT, NIV. I have, you know, New King James Version. But I guarantee, I say
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.200]   that this is the best version that I ever read in my life. And I really appreciate the
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.440]   teamwork, what they have done. And this is very much a useful tool, like our pastors
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.000]   in India, so that we can preach accurately the Word of God and to equip many saints to
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.700]   the kingdom of God. Robbie, thanks for joining us today.
