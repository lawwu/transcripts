[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   I would like to call your attention this evening to the fourteenth verse in the seventh chapter
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.200]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans. The epistle to the Romans, chapter seven, verse fourteen.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:27.240]   "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin." We come now
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.240]   to this most interesting verse and to the beginning of this most interesting section
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.080]   in this seventh chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. Indeed, we come to what is
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:48.480]   beyond any doubt the most famous and well-known section in the entire epistle. It is perhaps
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.440]   in many ways one of the most well-known and famous sections of scripture in the entire
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.920]   Bible. There is no section of scripture, certainly, which has so frequently led to debate and
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.800]   disputation. Unfortunately, one must add even wrangling and display of spirit far removed
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.880]   from that which is taught in the New Testament and offered in the New Testament message.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.600]   Therefore, this is a subject, obviously, which we approach, I trust, with a good deal of
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.880]   caution and certainly with a maximum amount of humility. Now, the dispute, of course,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.800]   has always been with regard to this question. Who is this man whom the apostle is describing
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.720]   in this section? You may recall that we have divided up the chapter into three main sections.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.000]   The first ran from verse one to verse six. There wasn't much difficulty about that.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Then there was a second one which went from verse seven to twelve. You remember I put
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.400]   before you the possibilities with regard to verse thirteen. Well, there was comparative
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.920]   difficulty, but nothing like the difficulty that there is with regard to this third and
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.480]   last section, which starts at this fourteenth verse and goes on to the end of the chapter.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.960]   Now the difficulty arises, as you know, over the identity of the man described by the apostle
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:41.120]   in these verses. And there have been three main views with regard to this man. There
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.600]   have been those who have said that the apostle is here describing an unregenerate man, a
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.480]   man who has not been born again, a man who is in the state of nature, who has not yet
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   been quickened and regenerated. They think it's the description of an unregenerate man.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.080]   The second view is that it is a description of the regenerate man. And not only a description
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.800]   of the regenerate man, but a description of a regenerate man always at his best even,
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.600]   that the apostle Paul was describing himself and his own experience at that time when he
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.720]   penned these particular words. That's the second view. That is, this is an account of
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.600]   the Christian man and his experience in life in this world, even at his best.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.960]   Then there is a third view which says, no, it is not an account of the regenerate man
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:55.120]   at his best. It is an account of the regenerate man in the early stages, at the beginning,
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.280]   before he has received a kind of second blessing, a second experience, which takes him out of
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.160]   this and puts him into the kind of experience described in the eighth chapter. So they would
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.720]   say, those who belong to the third view, and adhere to this third view, that this is only
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.880]   a preliminary and a temporary stage in the experience of the regenerate man.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:31.000]   Now those are the three main views, the three common views which have been held with regard
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   to this particular section. The history of the differing views is interesting. I'm
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.740]   not going to keep you with it, but I think it is well that we should know just something
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.800]   about it, because whatever else it may do, I trust that it will produce in us the desired
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.760]   humility to which I referred at the beginning. Anybody who approaches this section without
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.840]   doing so, in fear and trembling, and without humility, is in a very bad state and is really
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.520]   not fit to expound Scripture at all. So I will remind you of something, a tenorate of
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:16.920]   the history of the interpretation. It is generally agreed that the fathers of the Church during
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.360]   the first three centuries, most of them, the majority of them, regarded this as being a
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:32.040]   description of the unregenerate men. That's just a fact of history. There were some exceptions,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.640]   but speaking of them as a whole, it is true to say that for the first three centuries,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.320]   the great doctors of the Church, the great fathers, the patristic fathers, so-called,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:51.720]   and others, they took this view that this was an account of the unregenerate men.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.920]   Then we add this immediately. You come to the great figure, the great person of the
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.480]   men whom we describe as Saint Augustine, the great Augustine of Hippo, one of the great
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.960]   luminaries in the whole story of the Christian Church, that great bishop in the Church in
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:20.360]   North Africa, who lived round about the year 400 A.D. Now, his story with regard to this
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.720]   section is particularly interesting, because he began by regarding it, as those who had
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.920]   gone before him had done in general, as a description of the unregenerate men. But Augustine
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.160]   was a very great man, and he gave proof of that by changing his mind on this. Now, I'm
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.000]   not saying that he proved he was a great man by adopting the second opinion. I say the
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.680]   mark of greatness was that he was big enough to change his mind. It's a very little and
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.120]   narrow mind that's afraid to change, that must hold on to what it's always said. It's
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.840]   a sign of greatness, that it is prepared to admit that you're wrong at times, and that
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.760]   therefore you've got to change your position. Well, Augustine did that, and from teaching
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.960]   that it was the unregenerate men, he then championed the exposition that it was clearly
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   the regenerate men, and the regenerate men even at his best. So Augustine, you see, moved
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:32.240]   from number one to number two. Then, the next point I make is this, that the Protestant
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:40.800]   reformers and the Puritans, and all who have followed them, have almost without exception
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.000]   followed the second exposition of Augustine. In other words, they have taught that this
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.600]   is a description of the regenerate men. And of course, we've got two well-known examples
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:00.560]   in Dr. Charles Hodge and in Robert Halden, both of whose commentaries I have so frequently
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.600]   recommended and praised. They both take the view that this is a description of the regenerate
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:14.080]   men. The reformed tradition of exposition has generally done that. On the other hand,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:20.880]   those who have followed a different theological system, commonly called Arminian, they have
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.200]   generally said that this is a description of the unregenerate men, the view that was
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.520]   taken by the patristic fathers. But then there have been others who have, while belonging
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.880]   to the reformed tradition, in the main tenor and exposition of the scripture and their
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:51.720]   teaching, have taken the view concerning this that it is not a description of the full-fledged
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   regenerate men, of the regenerate men at his best and as long as he lives in this world.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   Well now then, there you are. There is a very, very brief summary of the history of the interpretation.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.440]   And I've taken the trouble to say all that as I say in order to show that we must indeed
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:19.360]   approach it with care and especially with great humility. Nothing I always feel is quite
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:27.600]   so bad and reprehensible as a party spirit. I don't care which party you belong to nor
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:35.240]   what views you hold. A party spirit is always wrong, always. We should be concerned about
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:42.880]   the truth and not a party that represents a particular view of truth. In other words,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.080]   let me put it like this. Though we all of necessity must hold a particular point of
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:57.360]   view, though we must adhere to some system of doctrine, we can't evade that, we can't
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.200]   avoid that. People who say that they don't belong to any particular system, well, they're
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.320]   just telling us exactly what their system is. And I could put a name to it, but I'm
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.960]   not going to do so. But what I am saying is this, that though we may find ourselves in
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:22.200]   general following, because we are convinced it's right, a particular line of exposition,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:31.440]   a particular school of thought and of teaching, a particular view of dogmatic theology, that,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:40.480]   I say, must never blind us. We must never allow that to turn into a party spirit. We
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.120]   must never say, "Now the one thing that I must do is that I must arrive at an exposition
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.880]   that fits in with that." Now that is what is so fatal. Though this is true of us, we
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.240]   must come to every particular statement of the Scripture with an open mind. We must try
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.920]   to discover what the Scripture is saying, because no system is perfect. And at particular
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.240]   points, even the best system may have certain defects. Indeed, that is undoubtedly the case.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.440]   No system worked out by men ever has been perfect or ever will be. Therefore, I say,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.560]   though we are governed in general by certain views, that doesn't mean that we've got
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:28.480]   to slavishly follow what has generally been taught by that particular school of thought.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.120]   We must always be honest with ourselves. We must believe that we have the unction of the
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.360]   Holy Spirit. We must believe that no teachers in the Church have had a monopoly of truth,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:48.440]   a complete monopoly. We must realize that at certain points, the best systems can be,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:55.280]   and indeed are, somewhat defective. Now then, very well. So we approach this, I say, at
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   one and the same time with great humility, with great carefulness and concern. And yet,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.200]   I say, we mustn't approach it with a prejudiced mind. We must never be prejudiced. We must
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   keep our minds open, and we must approach it thus with minds enlightened by the Holy
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.920]   Spirit, having asked the Spirit to do so, and believing with the first epistle of John
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.760]   chapter 2, that we have an unction and an anointing of that Holy One, that that was
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:34.320]   not confined to any particular person. All right. You see, we are approaching a very
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.600]   difficult section of Scripture. Now then, how are we going to do? What are we going
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:46.240]   to do? Well, of course, we were confronted by two possible ways of doing this. One way
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:53.680]   would have been for me to tell you now immediately what view I hold of this section, and then,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.640]   as we come to the particular statement, proceed to prove that this view is right. That was
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.600]   a possible way of approach, but I have rejected it as a way of approach, because I believe
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.920]   that there is another method which is not only better, I think it's more scriptural,
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.080]   and I think it is one that we have always tried to follow, which is this. First of all,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.760]   let us, as it were, go to the statements, as if we held no view with respect to the
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.800]   whole section. Let's examine the statements. Let's try to discover what each one says,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.880]   and then, having arrived at what seems to us to be the meaning of the statements in
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.680]   front of us, let's gather that all together and try to arrive at a conclusion. Now, that
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:50.240]   is undoubtedly the better method. It's a right method in almost any realm and department
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.480]   of life. It's always well to listen to the evidence before you give a verdict. It's
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.320]   a very poor judge who starts with his verdict and then is just waiting to turn down things
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.680]   that are said to him instead of listening to them and giving them their full value.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:14.600]   An ordinary judicial, fair-minded man, I suggest, would follow this particular procedure. And
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:21.080]   as we know, and should know as Christians, the terrible danger of prejudice, which often
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:28.480]   has led to rancour and wrangling and bitter party spirit and personalities and so on.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   Well, it behoves us more than anybody, I think, to adopt this second method. So we will proceed
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.920]   to take it in the way that we have generally approached any other passage of Scripture.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.080]   I'm not going to give you a view and then prove I'm right. No, no, we'll adopt the
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.280]   inductive method and we'll work up to a conclusion. Very well. So I would start then
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:56.120]   with a general analysis of the section. I realize that I'm making a great call upon
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.200]   the patience of many in this congregation. You may have to hold yourselves in for a few
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:10.000]   weeks before you know exactly what I'm going to say. Now that's very good for your sanctification.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.840]   You see, we are all so imbued with this other idea, so that if I had no other reason for
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.000]   not starting with what I believe about this section, that would be sufficient to guide
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.240]   me. Now let's take a general analysis. I suggest to you it can be divided like this.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:36.480]   Verse 14. Here the apostle makes a general statement about the position and the condition
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:45.200]   of the man described, whoever he was. He is giving a general description of this man.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.440]   We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. There is a general
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:56.240]   statement with regard to the position and the condition of this man he's describing.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:07.040]   Verse 15. That position and condition shown in practice and in daily life. For that which
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   I do I allow not; for what I would that do I not; but what I hate that I do. That's how
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:22.720]   this man described in verse 14 behaves. Verses 16 and 17. Two inferences or deductions he
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:30.040]   therefore draws about this man. The first, "If then, if then, I do that which I would
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.000]   not, I consent unto the law that it is good." A perfectly fair inference or deduction. But
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.680]   he's got a second, "Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:50.160]   That's his second deduction about this man. Very well. Verses 18 to 20 are, as I understand
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:59.520]   them, a fuller exposition and explanation of what he has said about this man in verse
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.560]   17. Here is his statement. "Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.240]   in me." And here is his exposition. "For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.440]   no good thing; for to will is present with me, but out of a form that which is good I
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.720]   find not; for the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:26.200]   I do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.560]   in me." In other words, he's back again at what he said in verse 17. Now that's typical
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.640]   of the Apostle's method. And as I've often pointed out, it is so typical of the method
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   of some of the great musical composers, especially a man like Beethoven. Theme stated, split
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.560]   up into different parts, he seems to go away, comes back to it. So I suggest that verses
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:54.680]   18 and 20 are an exposition of the statement made in verse 17. Verse 21, back again to
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:03.240]   another general statement, but at a somewhat deeper level. In verse 21, he is in effect
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.440]   almost taking up again the statement of verse 14, but in the light of what he's just been
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:16.960]   saying he adds to it. Here is the statement then, "I find then a law that when I would
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:25.400]   do good, evil is present with me." Here is another general statement about this man.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:32.800]   Then in verses 22 and 23, he expounds that which he's just said in verse 21, "For I delight
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.040]   in the law of God after the inward men, but I see another law in my members, warring against
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:45.760]   the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.200]   That's the evil that is present in me. So those two verses are an exposition of verse
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:59.680]   21. Then verse 24, the cry of despair, and at the same time the cry for deliverance that
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:06.480]   results from realizing that he is in this terrible position that he's been describing.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:17.720]   Verse 25, this I put like this, "the ejaculation of relief." I deliberately call it the ejaculation
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:24.680]   of relief, and then the summing up of the whole statement that he has been making about
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:31.360]   this man in the entire section. Very well. There then, I would put it to you, is a kind
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:38.000]   of general analysis of the whole section. Now then, let's take a closer view, a little
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:49.240]   bit of it. What is it about? What is the main thrust of the section? What is he really concerned
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:56.880]   to do here? Well, we start with the first word, which is the word "for." Never has this
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.240]   word "for" been more important than it is at this point, because it tells us this. He
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:11.280]   is not starting an entirely new section here. He is not starting a new subject here. He
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.320]   is continuing the previous one. "For," he says, he's going on with it. There isn't
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:24.000]   an abrupt pause here, undertaking up of something quite new, de novo. No, no. He's continuing.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.760]   "For," it's going on. Clearly, then, I say, a continuation of the previous subject,
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:40.960]   and something which is meant to be an elaboration, and a further and a deeper exposition of what
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:48.000]   he has already been saying. Well, but you didn't take my opinion for that, because
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.120]   the other term, the next term, I call attention to settles it once and forever. "For,"
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:00.920]   he says, we know. What do we know? Well, that the law is spiritual. In other words, he's
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:07.960]   still talking about the law, as he has been from the first verse of this chapter. That
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.720]   is the theme. He hasn't finished with the law. He hasn't finished with his dealing with
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:18.240]   the law, and his various exposition with regard to the law. So, I am suggesting that from
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:25.800]   this verse 14 to the end of the chapter, he is still dealing with the same major theme
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:34.360]   that has occupied him from verse 1 of the chapter. What is that? Well, he is answering
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:42.960]   the charge that is brought against him with respect to his teaching concerning the law.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:50.880]   And we have seen that he says that there are two main charges which are brought against
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.520]   his teaching. Two subsidiary ones. The general charge was, of course, that he was dismissing
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.800]   the law altogether, and that he said the law was of no use at all. That he answers in the
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   first six verses. But, in answering that in the first six verses, he has made two statements
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:18.400]   about the law. And, these are two statements to which people object. The first was the
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:24.440]   one which he raised in verse 7. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Wait a minute,
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.080]   says somebody, in verse 5, didn't you say that the law was sin? For when we were in
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.880]   the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law, energized by the law, did work in
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   our members to bring forth fruit unto death. Didn't you say in that fifth verse, says
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:46.560]   somebody, that the law is sin? And we have seen that from verse 7 to verse 12, Paul has
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.320]   been dealing with it, and proving that he hasn't said anything of the sort. It isn't
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:57.360]   the law that's sin. It is sin itself that has so abused and twisted and misused the
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.000]   law that it has produced that result. But, says somebody else, a second objector, wait
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.360]   a minute, I noticed you said something else in verse 5. In verse 5 you say, "For when
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:17.720]   we were in the flesh, the motions of sins which were by the law, did work in our members
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:26.960]   to bring forth fruit, that's to say sin, unto death." Very well, says the second objector
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   in verse 13. "Was then that which is good made death unto me?" And he has said, "God
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   forbid but sin that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good, that sin
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.320]   by the commandment might become exceeding sinful." In other words, you see what he's
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:51.640]   doing. Having made his fundamental general statement in the first six verses, he now
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:57.760]   takes up two particular objections. One, that he's saying that the law is sin. He's dealt
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:06.040]   with that in verses 7 to 12. In verse 13, the second objection, that he is saying that
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:13.600]   the law is death, and that the law produces death. That's how he puts it. "Was then
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:20.440]   that which is good made death unto me?" And at once he refutes it, saying, "God forbid,"
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:25.640]   and explains in general what really does take place, the thing we considered last Friday
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.280]   night. But he wasn't satisfied with it. You see, this is always his method. What, in verse
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:37.920]   7, what then shall we say? "Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I have not known sin but
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.320]   by the law." Then he proceeds to expound it in the following verses. He does the same
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:49.120]   thing here. "Was then that which is good made death unto me?" The second thing he seems
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.880]   to be saying in verse 5. He answers it immediately in the remainder of verse 13, but he doesn't
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   stop at that. He goes on then to expound that. That is what we have in verses 14 to the end
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:06.840]   of the chapter. So, at any rate, it seems to me to be the way to understand this entire
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:19.000]   section. Or, if you like me to put it positively, he is concerned here to show us his real view
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.040]   of the law. What the law is in and of itself. What it was meant to do, and especially what
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.320]   it was not meant to do. Now, we've already touched upon that because he's already given
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.440]   us hints of it. The law is God's law. It is holy and just and good. It was meant to do
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.800]   certain things. Yes, but it was not meant to do certain other things. And it cannot
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.880]   do them. That is why we have to become dead to it before those things can happen. Now
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.120]   then, he's still concerned, I suggest, to do exactly this thing. That is his fundamental
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:02.480]   object. In particular, to show what the law could not do. In other words, the apostle
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.000]   in this section is not primarily concerned to give his experience. He isn't setting
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.760]   out just to tell us something about himself. He is telling us about what he thinks about
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.800]   the law, the nature of the law, what the law is meant to do, what the law is not meant
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:23.760]   to do, the limits to the law, what the law, in other words, cannot do. In other words,
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:32.160]   I am suggesting this to you. That in this section, 14 to the end, he is in particular
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:40.800]   refuting the charge that he had taught in verse 5 that the law is death, or produces
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:49.920]   death. He is refuting that. But he is at the same time showing how the law, because of
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.120]   sin in man, becomes a minister of death. He had already shown it, you see, with respect
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.920]   to the charge that the law is sin. He says, no, the law is not sin. But because of the
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:07.160]   character of sin in man, the law aggravates sin, produces it, in a sense makes a man sin,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:13.080]   brings out this exceeding sinfulness on sin. Now, there is my suggestion as to what he
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   is saying. Let me give you a little proof of this at this moment, before we go any further.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:25.720]   Have a look at what he says in chapter 8, in verses 2 and 3. He says in verse 2, "For
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:37.440]   the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.920]   death." The two things again, you see. That law, because of sin in man, has become a law
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:51.640]   of sin, a law that aggravates sin. But it has also become a law that produces death,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:59.920]   or aggravates death, again because of sin. So he now calls it the law of sin and death.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.720]   That is the same law that he has been talking about at the beginning of chapter 7, where
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.800]   he says that we are now dead to it, that we are finished with it. He has proved that in
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.920]   terms of the relationship between a husband and wife. "Wherefore, my brethren, you also
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:19.360]   have become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that you should be married to another."
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.600]   Now, having said all he said about it in chapter 7, he here in chapter 8 too refers to it as
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:34.680]   the law of sin and death. And then to make it doubly sure, he says, "For what the law
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:41.440]   could not do," that's what he's concerned about, "what the law could not do, because
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.880]   it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.240]   and for sin, condemns sin in the flesh, that in order that the righteousness of the law
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:59.280]   might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit." In other
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:06.560]   words, I suggest to you that in chapter 8 in verses 2 and 3, he is, as is custom so
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.960]   commonly is, summing up for us all he's been saying in chapter 7. He says, "Well, now
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.440]   that I've proved it to you, that's what I've been saying, that now the law of the
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:22.520]   Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set us free altogether from that law which had become
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:34.040]   to us a law of sin and death." The two things, sin, verses 7 to 12, death, verses 13 to 25.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   And then above all, I say, this original intention to prove that the law was never given either
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.440]   to justify or to sanctify us, that indeed it has become an actual hindrance to that,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:52.600]   and we've got to be set free and delivered from it before we can be sanctified. Very
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.320]   well. I am suggesting then that that is what this section is about. The section is about
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:05.760]   the law, what it does do, what it doesn't do, what it can't do. That is the theme,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:13.600]   not experience, but the theme is still the law and the truth about the law of God.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.880]   Very well. There's another general point as we proceed to the exposition. There is
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.960]   one other general point that I must take up, and that is, of course, the point that is
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:32.000]   so constantly made, that here the apostle changes the tense in which he speaks. Hitherto
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.520]   he's been talking about the past. He has said, "I was alive without the law once,
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:46.080]   but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. And the commandment which was
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:52.480]   ordained to life I found to be unto death. Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.760]   me and by it slew me." He's talking about the past, and we agreed last time that he
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:04.440]   was talking about the past. But now then, says somebody, here he suddenly
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:11.160]   changes his tense. He says, "We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal."
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.760]   Not "I was carnal," "I am carnal, sold under sin." And he goes on in the present,
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:24.320]   "For that which I do," not "what I did," "that which I do I allow not," and so on.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.920]   "That which I would," "that do I not," "but what I hate," "that do I." It's
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:36.680]   all, they say, and rightly say, in the present tense. What about this? Well, there are those,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.200]   you see, who say that this settles the whole matter, and that when he says "I am,"
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.120]   he means "I am," and when he says "I do," "I do," and that it can mean nothing
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.240]   but that, that he's describing his position, his condition at the present time. But of
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.520]   course that doesn't follow for a moment. That doesn't prove anything whatsoever.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.480]   If that were sufficient as a proof, there would never have been the great discussion
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.200]   that I've described to you, and men like Augustine would never have changed from one
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.720]   to the other. That does not settle the question. It's not as simple as that, for this good
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.240]   reason. That a form that is very often adopted in
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:23.320]   demonstrating a case, or in establishing a point, a form that is very often employed
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.720]   in order to do that is to employ this kind of dramatic present. One does it very often
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:35.880]   in preaching. I often use this method myself. I say to a man, if he puts up a position,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.760]   well, I say, "Well, now, then, if that is so, well, the position in which you leave
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:45.720]   me is this." And then I say, "Well, if that is so, well, then, if I say this, and
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.640]   I'm putting it all, you see, in the present, I do this, I say that, I'm dramatizing the
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.360]   thing, I am saying, well, now, then, this is the position in which you leave me." And
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.960]   then I proceed to put it in terms of that position. This is how I find myself if what
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.920]   he was saying is right. It's a very, very common form of establishing a point. It's
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.520]   something that often happens, indeed, almost invariably, in an illustration. So that we
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:22.520]   are equally entitled to say that the apostle here is putting this whole position in this
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:29.920]   personal way in order to make it objective, to put it in terms of a person, and how that
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:36.400]   person finds himself and what he finds in himself in the light of this position. In
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.120]   other words, all I'm saying at the moment is this, that we must not run away with the
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:53.000]   notion that the mere change in the tense establishes the only possible interpretation of this particular
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.600]   section. And let us say this, the great men who have taken the different points of view
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:04.000]   are, on the whole, quite ready to grant that what I've just been saying is, of course,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.720]   the simple and the well-known truth, that this personalizing, this dramatic representation,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.800]   is a form of interpretation and exposition in the Scripture that is frequently used.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.960]   Very well. So the change in tense need not make us feel that the matter is beyond any
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.160]   dispute. Now then, I've finished, I think, with the general points, and we can begin
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   to look at the statement of verse 14. What does he say? Well, he says, "We know that
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:45.080]   the law is spiritual." There's no need to go over that again. We're all agreed as if
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:52.440]   to say about that. He's already said that it is holy and just and good. He's repeated
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   that it's good. This is something that can be taken for granted now, then. "We know
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:08.080]   that the law is spiritual." At any rate, those to whom, to use his own phrase, the
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:15.400]   law has come when the commandment came. The moment it has come in that way, a man knows
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   that the law is spiritual. There's no need to argue about that. That's common ground.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:26.040]   But what does he mean by saying that it's spiritual? Well, he's again not really saying
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.080]   anything new. He's just reminding us of what he's already said. It is a law that has come
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:38.160]   from God, and because of that it is holy, it is just, it is good. God is spirit, his
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:48.280]   law is spiritual. But I think he means a second thing. He means that the law is not merely
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:56.520]   a matter of the letter. Now, you will find a wonderful exposition of that in 2 Corinthians
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:03.200]   chapter 3, where he has that interesting contrast, you remember, between the letter and the spirit.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:10.040]   He says here, verse 5, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.220]   as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God, who also hath made us able ministers
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.960]   of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter killeth, but
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:27.000]   the spirit giveth life." The law is spiritual. The mistake the Jews had made was to regard
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.800]   the letter only. They took a carnal view of it. "That was the veil that was still over
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.560]   their faces," he says there. Now, but that's not the Christian. The Christian view is that
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.520]   it is spiritual. Not the letter, but the spirit. Spirit is in contrast to letter. Well, he's
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:48.960]   already told us that. The non-spiritual view of the law regarded it as a matter which was
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:56.320]   concerned only about external actions. Ah, yes, but the spiritual view of the law knows
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.280]   that it is concerned about motives, desires, imaginations, thoughts, feelings, as it is
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:09.840]   about actions. "Thou shalt not covet." The moment a man realizes that the law says that,
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:15.040]   he's got a spiritual view of the law, and he realizes that the law is spiritual. Not
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:22.280]   a matter of the letter. It is a matter of the spirit. In other words, the law is spiritual
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:29.400]   in its intent. In other words, its concern is to lead to life, as he put it in verse
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:36.720]   10, "And the commandment which was ordained to life, if only men had kept it, it would
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:43.640]   have led to life. Do this and thou shalt live." That's spiritual. It leads, if carried out,
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:52.080]   to the life of God. So, he reminds us. And you see, he again likes to do this. He says,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.560]   "Now then, we'll all agree about this great fundamental proposition. The law itself is
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:07.400]   all right, it's of God, it's holy and just and good. It is spiritual. But alas, we know
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:20.520]   something else also." And he's been telling us this. "I am carnal, sold under sin."
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:29.000]   Now, here is, in many ways, the key statement of the whole of this section. And as is his
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.920]   custom, he puts it right at the beginning, so that we'll understand right through what
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:43.720]   he's talking about. Here is the first fundamental statement, the first general statement. Carnal.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:53.440]   What does it mean? Well, now, the word itself actually means "fleshy," pertaining to the
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:39:04.720]   flesh. Fleshly. You can use either of the words "fleshy" or "fleshly," L-Y. We've
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.200]   already met this term several times, we needn't delay. We have always interpreted it like
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:20.440]   this. It is a description of man as he is, in contrast with the life of the Spirit. The
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:27.920]   contrast is always flesh and Spirit. It's the contrast in this epistle, in Galatians,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.400]   it is the contrast that he has everywhere. It means man's life as organized and lived
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:41.280]   apart from God and the power of the Holy Spirit in the life. You've really got it in verse
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.400]   5, "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins which were by the law did work in
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:53.520]   our members to bring forth fruit unto death." Then you've got it again, you see, in verse
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.960]   6, "But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:06.840]   we should serve in newness of spirit, not in the oldness of the letter." Which we interpreted
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.920]   as saying this, that the oldness of the letter is characteristic of being under the law,
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.560]   which is the same thing as being in the flesh. A man who is in the flesh is under the law.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.800]   A man who is under the law is a man who is in the flesh.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:26.840]   Now then, what he says here is, "I am carnal." He doesn't say that the flesh that remained
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.600]   in him was carnal. He doesn't say that there was something that was still within him that
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:40.240]   was carnal. He says that he himself is carnal. "I am carnal."
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.600]   Now then, let's be clear about this term, the use of this term in the Scripture. How
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:53.200]   does the Scripture use the term carnal? Well, it uses it in two main ways. The first way
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.160]   which it uses is the one I've already been expounding, and which you find again, for
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:05.040]   instance, in chapter 8, the next chapter, verses 5 to 9. He says, "They that are after
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:10.640]   the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit"—here's
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.200]   your contrast—"the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.560]   be spiritually minded is life and peace, because the carnal mind is enmity against God, is
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:28.120]   not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then, they that are in the flesh"—these
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:34.560]   carnal and carnally minded people—"cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh,
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.000]   but in the spirit. You are not carnal, you are in the spirit. If so be that the spirit
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.520]   of God dwell in you. Now if any man of not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:52.800]   Now that's the common use. But it is not the only use. There is a second use of the
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.160]   term "carnal," and we found it in our reading at the beginning, in the first epistle to
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:04.960]   the Corinthians, chapter 3, at the beginning, of which I want to remind you again. Now notice
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:16.200]   how the apostle puts it, "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:25.760]   but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk and not with
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.200]   meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able, for ye are
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:37.240]   yet carnal. For whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye not
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:44.440]   carnal and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:53.000]   are ye not carnal?" Now here, you see, is another use, a different use. Here he describes
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:04.680]   the carnal person as one who is a babe in Christ. He is an immature Christian. He is
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:11.640]   a Christian who lacks fuller understanding. He says, "I can't give you the fuller truth
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:20.040]   that I'd like to give you, because you are still carnal." What he means is this, obviously,
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.200]   that then they were born again and had become Christians. They are babes in Christ. So much
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:32.760]   of their thinking is still that old type of thinking. And therefore he says, "You are
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:38.880]   behaving as if you were still carnal." What else can he possibly mean then? They are born
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:46.040]   again. They are therefore in the Spirit. And yet he says they are carnal. And he says they
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.920]   are carnal because they go on thinking in that old way in which they used to think.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:44:00.520]   So the second use of the term carnal is, obviously, that of an immature Christian, or one who
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:07.400]   is a babe in Christ. Now those are the only two uses of this word
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:15.520]   carnal that we find in the Scripture. Yet here is a statement made, "We know that the
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:28.800]   law is spiritual, but I am carnal." Are we not already in a position to draw a deduction,
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:41.040]   an inference? This statement cannot possibly be about the mature Apostle Paul. He cannot
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.920]   say of himself, "I am carnal," as the great Apostle that wrote this epistle to the Romans.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:55.080]   If by carnal you mean what he says it means in chapter 8 of this epistle, in verses 5
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:02.200]   to 9. But it cannot possibly have the second meaning, which is that the Apostle is only
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:09.560]   a babe in Christ. Because in writing there to the Corinthians, he not only talks to them
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.720]   and says that they are babes, and that he cannot give them the spiritual teaching which
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:22.800]   he has as a spiritual man, because they are babes, but he says that there are other Christians
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:31.680]   who are spiritual, who have the mind of Christ. "He that is spiritual judgeth all things."
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.200]   Here's a type of Christian who can follow this exalted teaching. They can't because
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.680]   they're carnal, because they're babes. He's got the teaching for them. Well then I say
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:50.000]   he cannot possibly say of himself, "I am carnal," in that sense. So whatever is being
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:00.600]   said here, we can say this. This is not a statement about a man who is just unregenerate.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.200]   Neither is it a statement about a man who is as fully developed as a Christian as a
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:12.560]   man can possibly be in this life and in this world. Very well, my time is gone, and I'm
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.920]   afraid we've got to leave it at that this evening. But it's not a bad point to stop
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:27.120]   at. We know that the law is spiritual, all right, but I, who is this? Well, all I know
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:34.680]   about it is this. He is somebody who is carnal. Look through your Bible, it's just for the
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:41.280]   meaning of the word carnal. Try and find something over and above what I've put before you,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:49.560]   and then face that question. Is that a description of the apostle Paul when he wrote this epistle?
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.880]   Is it a description of a Christian man who has matured as much as it is possible for
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:00.760]   a Christian to mature and to develop while he is alive in this world? All right, don't
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:06.960]   go further than that. But you see, it's a preliminary and a key statement. We mustn't
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:13.560]   rush past it. I am carnal. It isn't the only thing that is true about this "I."
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:19.680]   There's another thing which we'll go on to consider next week, God willing. Soul under
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.600]   sin. All right. Our great lesson, I trust, this
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:33.120]   evening is this, that we see at any rate the importance of approaching the Scripture in
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:45.360]   a particular manner, in a particular spirit. Now then, let flesh be done. Its heats expire.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:50.640]   Let us look at these words, these terms. Let us compare Scripture with Scripture. Let's
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.520]   follow these terms and words through the Scriptures wherever we find them, so that we shall eventually
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:08.760]   be able to try to arrive at some kind of a conclusion. I am carnal. Let us pray.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:16.280]   We come to thee again, our heavenly Father, and we come to acknowledge and to recognize
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:25.400]   the marvel and the mystery of thy ways, the greatness of thy truth. O Lord, we feel that
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.840]   left to ourselves we are indeed utterly hopeless. We thank thee more than ever for the gift
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:36.840]   of thy Spirit and for everything thou hast ever given us, which helps to bring us to
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:43.800]   an understanding of thy truth. We thank thee of the men thou hast raised in ages past,
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:49.720]   the men whom thou hast made great and noble and mighty. We thank thee for all the faculties
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:55.560]   and the gifts with which thou didst endure them and endow them. We thank thee above all
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:03.160]   for their pattern and example of godliness and holiness and righteous living. O Lord,
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.840]   keep us, we pray thee, ever with a single eye to thy glory, a concern to know thee and
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   the Lord Jesus Christ by the Spirit, and to arrive at a knowledge, an increasing knowledge,
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:24.160]   of thy precious truth. Will thou therefore look upon us and bless us as we continue privately
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:31.840]   and separately to read and to study thy word? O Lord, look upon us. Keep us, we pray thee,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:38.720]   ever mindful of its greatness and our smallness and the need of thy Spirit. Take us then,
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:46.320]   O Lord, and bless us upon our several ways and use us all in the extension of thy kingdom
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:54.040]   and in bringing glory to thy great and holy and wonderful name. And now may the grace
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:59.600]   of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:08.480]   Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore. Amen.
