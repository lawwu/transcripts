[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   So one of the pillars of strength training is eccentric strength, which is breaks.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.420]   So you know, you're going to hurt yourself 10 times more likely, I'm making that number
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680]   up by the way, I don't know if it's 10 times, but experientially it seems to be, you are
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.160]   10 times more likely to hurt yourself stepping off something than stepping onto something,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160]   right?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.280]   Stepping down versus stepping up.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.760]   Because when you step up onto something, you are concentrically controlling the muscle.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.680]   When you step down, you have to apply the brakes and that's where most people falter.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.800]   Much harder to walk downhill than uphill.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.000]   Uphill is taxing your cardiovascular system, but if you slow down enough, you're fine.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500]   But a lot of people don't have the ability to slow themselves down when they're walking
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500]   downhill.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.200]   And so when an older person steps off a curb and can't fully stop themselves, and that
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.920]   results in a fall.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160]   So you know, I like doing things like a broad jump.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.480]   Broad jumps are a fun little test set I like to do every once in a while.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.640]   I always want to make sure I can broad jump six feet, that's kind of my arbitrary number
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.120]   that I've chosen.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.080]   And the reason is, on the takeoff, that's a very explosive movement, but the landing
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.080]   is just as important.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.800]   If I can't stick that landing, it means I don't have the brakes.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.640]   So those are kind of some of the tests I want to be able to do to make sure that I'm utilizing
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640]   that system.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.160]   Because I do think, you know, look, I've watched my mom.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.440]   My mom fell, gosh, probably been about four months ago, just fell in a typical way that
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.440]   people fall.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.000]   By the way, it could have happened to anybody.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.320]   It's not like, you know, my mom walks around and moves around just fine.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.440]   But on this particular day, she just tripped on a uneven stone and fell and landed and
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   broke her hand.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.360]   And she's really lucky she didn't break her hip.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.560]   And I told her that because my mom was, you know, probably in her mid-70s.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.840]   And I said, look, you know, if that was your femur, I'd give you a 30% chance of dying
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   in the next year.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.240]   I mean, it's just an... those are such difficult to recover from injuries.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.920]   Because first of all, you're dealing with the immobility of, you know, the hospitalization
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.600]   and immobility that follows that.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.120]   And the amount of muscle loss that occurs could easily be, you know, four or five pounds
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.440]   of lean tissue lost, that for most people that age becomes almost impossible to get
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   back.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.360]   And that says nothing about sort of the acute causes of death, like a fat embolism that
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.240]   results from a broken femur, a blood clot from laying in bed.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.400]   Those things are also catastrophic.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.720]   But what happens is a lot of these patients just never get back to the same level of mobility.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.100]   And you know, now I think in many ways, we're kind of pivoting from what kills you to what
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.560]   ruins your quality of life.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.600]   And we've spent so much time talking about what kills you, but I think you might as well
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.240]   be dead in some ways if you can't do the things you want to do.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.520]   And if playing with your grandkids, or gardening, or playing golf, or going for a walk with
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.760]   your spouse, or think of any of the things that we all do today and take for granted,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.840]   if you can't do those things, I don't know, you sort of lose the reason to be around.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.640]   And oftentimes, the inability to do those things is associated with pain, which is psychologically
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.360]   and obviously physiologically so distressing.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.960]   You mentioned the four pillars of health.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   Maybe just list those off for people.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   Of lifting?
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.800]   Well, the four pillars of longevity through physical.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.320]   Oh, yeah, sort of the exercise pieces of them.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.760]   Health, health, health, stability, aerobic efficiency, and aerobic peak output.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.320]   So aerobic peak would be like VO2 max.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.120]   And zone two.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.320]   In my analogy, your zone two is how wide the base of your pyramid is.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   And your VO2 max is how tall the peak of the pyramid is.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   So the best pyramid has a wide base and a high peak.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.380]   So you could have a reasonably wide base and a shallow peak.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.560]   If you just did zone two training, you're going to get a reasonable peak, but it's not
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   going to be that high.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.160]   You have to do some of that specific training.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   If you just focus on high intensity, you might drive up that VO2 max, but you're actually
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.880]   going to have a relatively wide, narrow aerobic base.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.140]   So you think about just maximizing the area of that triangle, widest, tallest.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.140]   Stability and strength.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.560]   Stability of course encompasses everything we're talking about in terms of reactivity.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.580]   You know, I dedicate a chapter in the book to this concept because it is so foreign to
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.860]   most people and for understandable reasons.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.820]   It's just, it's not sexy.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.380]   It's not, it's the hardest one to train.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.180]   It's the hardest one to understand, but it's so important because it's the thing that I
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.060]   think differentiates people who age well and people who don't age well.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.900]   And I should perhaps throw in there, please correct me if I'm wrong, but also most of
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.900]   the machines that are in typical commercial gyms that allow people who are not very experienced
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.020]   to start doing some resistance training don't really tap into the stability factor terribly
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.020]   much.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.880]   So while there's value to leg extensions and leg curls and, you know, chest presses and
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.620]   shoulder presses done with machines, certainly for a number of reasons and can often be safer
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.060]   than free weights, especially for people who are approaching it at a later time or new
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.100]   to the whole thing, they don't really lend themselves to real life stability.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.340]   Walking down, as you mentioned, walking downstairs in the absence of a handrail or movements
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.900]   in kind of odd planes, you know, having to step aside to avoid a bicycle at an angle
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.260]   as opposed to just moving, you know, linearly.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.060]   And by the way, a lot of things that don't involve machines still don't give you that,
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.060]   right?
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.500]   If you're doing a deadlift, you have to be stable to lift a heavy weight like you would
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.420]   a deadlift without hurting yourself.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.260]   That requires an unbelievable capacity to harness intra-abdominal pressure and to be
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.260]   connected.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.600]   You know, if you're going to lift 500 pounds off the ground, you're stable.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.820]   But that still doesn't prepare you for what you just described.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.060]   So stability is multifaceted and it involves doing a lot of things.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.940]   You know, today, for example, I finished my...
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.100]   Yesterday was a cardio zone two day, so I did my cardio zone two and, you know, had
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.280]   an extra 10 minutes before I needed to kind of get moving.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.740]   And so all I did was step ups for 10 minutes.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:35.020]   I just did single leg, very slow step up and insanely slow step downs off a box in a gym.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.380]   So two second up, four second down, two second up, four second down with, you know, and I
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.920]   would do them with ipsilateral loads, contralateral loads, all sorts of different things.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.340]   And, you know, basically that's just a stability game for me.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:55.200]   It's like I'm building that concentric strength in a movement where it's easy to cheat.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.360]   But can I do it without cheating?
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   It's terrific.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   And it's terrific that you covered all of that in the book.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:09.020]   Thank you.
