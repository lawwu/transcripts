[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - You did mention that you thought that understanding
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   of the way ant colonies are able to perform
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.160]   incredibly organized tasks might well be the key
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.520]   to understanding human cognition.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.080]   So these fundamentally distributed systems.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.720]   So what do you think is the difference
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.920]   between the way Don Knuth would sort a list
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.840]   and an ant colony would sort a list
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.880]   or perform an algorithm?
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.920]   - Sorting a list isn't the same as cognition though,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.380]   but I know what you're getting at.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.080]   Well, the advantage of ant colony,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.600]   at least we can see what they're doing.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.640]   We know which ant has talked to which other ant
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   and it's much harder with the brains
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.680]   to know to what extent neurons are passing signal.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.760]   So I'm just saying that ant colony might be,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.040]   if they have the secret of cognition,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.920]   think of an ant colony as a cognitive single being
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.400]   rather than as a colony of lots of different ants.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.320]   I mean, just like the cells of our brain
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320]   and the microbiome and all that is interacting entities,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.960]   but somehow I consider myself to be a single person.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.640]   Well, an ant colony, you can say might be cognitive
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.560]   somehow and--
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.040]   - It sounds strange.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   - Yeah, I mean, okay, I smash a certain ant
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.120]   and the organism's saying, "Hmm, that stung.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.920]   "What was that?"
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.680]   But if we're going to crack the secret of cognition,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   it might be that we could do so by psyching out
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.720]   how ants do it because we have a better chance to measure
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.320]   the communicating by pheromones
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   and by touching each other and sight,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680]   but not by much more subtle phenomenon
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.320]   like electric currents going through.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.880]   - But even a simpler version of that,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.400]   what are your thoughts of maybe Conway's Game of Life?
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.040]   - Okay, so Conway's Game of Life is able to simulate
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.040]   any computable process and any deterministic process
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.720]   is--
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.080]   - I like how you went there.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   I mean, that's not its most powerful thing, I would say.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.480]   I mean, it can simulate it, but the magic is that
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   the individual units are distributed and extremely simple.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.960]   - Yes, we understand exactly what the primitives are.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.800]   - The primitives, just like with the ant colony,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.640]   even simpler though.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.620]   - But still, it doesn't say that I understand,
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.560]   I understand life.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.720]   I mean, I understand.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   It gives me a better insight into what does it mean
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.000]   to have a deterministic universe?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   What does it mean to have free choice, for example?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.960]   - Do you think God plays dice?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.640]   - Yes, I don't see any reason why God should be forbidden
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   from using the most efficient ways to,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.980]   I mean, we know that dice are extremely important
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.800]   in efficient algorithms.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.100]   There are things that couldn't be done well
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.340]   without randomness, and so I don't see any reason
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.180]   why God should be prohibited from--
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.540]   - When the algorithm requires it,
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.140]   you don't see why the physics should constrain it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.840]   - Yeah.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   (audience cheering)
