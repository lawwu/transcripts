[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   And this is something that William MacAskill talks about.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.900]   From what I've read of his, he takes seriously enough the question that we
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.700]   don't know what those future people will want, you know, there's no question that
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.600]   what we want today would have seemed abhorrent to people, you know, most
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.640]   people, 1800, you know, in, in 1800.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.840]   So the idea that we can have any other idea other than they probably want to be
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.820]   alive, it seems much more questionable.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.940]   And so there's two ways to look at it.
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.580]   One is the, the wizards say, let's, you know, we have an idea.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.140]   They're going to want to live in this, you know, a certain kind of utopia and
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.620]   live their longest lives and, and, and, have the maximum possible physical
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.860]   comfort, but the prophets might say, well, we should be more epistemologically,
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.040]   you know, humble say, we don't know what they want to let's preserve as many
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   options as possible for them.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.440]   Cause that's the same argument about burying nuclear waste, which I also
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.980]   think it's very powerful that we should probably not bury it in some system
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.420]   where it can't be gotten rid of for 10,000 years, we should just make sure
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.580]   that we can track it for a couple hundred years and, and there'll be more
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.180]   options for people 200 years from now than there are today.
