[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Well, we are making our final approach to the 500th anniversary of the Reformation that
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.800]   will be celebrated on Tuesday the 31st.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.000]   And this weekend is a big one for you, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.600]   You're right now in Phoenix, Arizona, speaking several times, including Friday and Saturday
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.400]   at Grand Canyon University, and then scheduled to preach Sunday, Reformation Sunday, at Harvest
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   Bible Church.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.120]   Please be praying for Pastor John and his busy weekend in Phoenix.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.440]   We would appreciate it.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440]   Today's question comes from a listener named Barb.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.800]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920]   I've been blessed to be in the same local church for 12 years.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.400]   It's a very good church.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.640]   Nevertheless, over those years, I have seen most of the congregation come and go.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.920]   People who walked with me through difficult life circumstances have left, and I've started
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.920]   over.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.880]   I feel more and more lonely as the time passes by, mostly because I feel myself becoming
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   more cynical, cautious, and superficial with new people.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.160]   It's hard work getting to know them, and I know that they will likely move on before
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.560]   long.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.200]   What would you say to a Christian who is growing relationally jaded by membership turnover?"
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:27.000]   I would love to help Barb overcome the drift, because it is a sinful drift, even if an understandable
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.680]   one, the drift toward cynicism or anger or low-grade bitterness.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.400]   If for no other reason, then it won't solve her problem, and it will only make her own
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.880]   life more sad and miserable.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.840]   Then her sense of abandonment will become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because nobody
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.600]   wants to be around a bitter person.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.240]   So several things come to my mind that might help.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.880]   Let me just offer them to Barb and see if they might be of service.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:16.440]   Keep a clear biblical view of this life, this earthly life, this church life, this
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.400]   family life, this earthly life as a season of partly joyful, partly painful waiting for
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.720]   the fulfillment of all God's promises, a mindset of waiting in an imperfect situation.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.440]   Much of our frustration, I speak for myself at least, comes from having wrong expectations
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.040]   about what this world and even this age of church life will be.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.640]   We expect a better church, a better marriage, better kids, better government, better health,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720]   better friends, and the reality falls short.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   And the more it falls short, these expectations make us cynical and bitter.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:15.440]   I know that God is willing to do great things for us, but most of the time we are dealing
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   with people, including the one in the mirror, who falls short of what we hope for.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:33.360]   And therefore, we need to get a mindset about this age that is sober and marked by the long
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.400]   view of patient waiting, like James 5, 7 says, "Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   coming of the Lord."
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   Now that's a long patience.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.980]   It might be to the end of your life.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.980]   See how the farmer waits for precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it until
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.960]   it receives the early and late rain.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.900]   You also must be patient.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.500]   Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.940]   Do not grumble against one another.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.800]   So in circumstances and people around us in the world, in the church, in the family, let
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.380]   us down, James is calling us to hold fast to our hope and pursue the blessedness that
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.220]   comes precisely through patient waiting.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.980]   Because he says in chapter 5, "Behold, we consider those blessed who remain steadfast."
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.580]   You have heard of the steadfastness of Job and you have seen the purpose of the Lord,
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.020]   how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.340]   So that's the first thing, a mindset of realistic waiting in an imperfect world.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.700]   Here's number two.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:58.460]   Barb, keep in mind that Jesus himself tasted a kind of holy frustration with what happened
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.060]   with the people around him, even to his own disciples.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.540]   He said, "Oh, faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you?
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.580]   How long am I to bear with you?
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.580]   Bring him here to me."
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820]   And then he heals the boy.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:23.780]   It helps, helps me anyway, to know that there is a kind of godly frustration with the imperfections
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.140]   of this age, including the imperfections of God's people, including the imperfections
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.780]   of the whole system that keeps people moving around, coming in, moving out of God's church.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.500]   You're not alone in your disappointments.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.140]   Jesus himself felt some of what you are feeling.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.540]   That's number two.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:54.380]   Number three, never forget that both forgiving when you're sinned against and forbearing
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.740]   when you're simply frustrated by other people's circumstances or weakness beyond their control,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:11.060]   both these, forgiving and forbearing, grow in the soil of amazement at God's grace in
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:18.260]   giving us such a privileged place in Christ, such a privileged identity.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.980]   So here's the passage that came to my mind.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:31.220]   This is Colossians 3.12, "Put on then as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, compassionate
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.940]   hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, patience, bearing with one another if one has a complaint
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.980]   against another, forgiving one another as the Lord has forgiven you, so you must forgive."
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.460]   In other words, bearing with or forbearing, that is just sucking it up and dealing with
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.900]   the pain and the frustration and the sorrows as well as forgiving those who genuinely sin
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900]   against you.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:06.140]   He says all of that is preceded by these three glorious realities.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.340]   You are chosen by God.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.440]   You are set apart for holy purposes by God.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.940]   You are loved by God.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.020]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.900]   That's the way he argues.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:23.900]   He begins the verse, "As chosen, as holy, as loved, forbear."
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:32.540]   This kind of joyful confidence in God's grace and who we are in him will make us like a
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:40.940]   fountain or a spring so that we can keep on giving ourselves in friendship.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.880]   This is where the rubber meets the road for Barb, I think.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.320]   Keep on giving ourselves in friendship when it feels like people only drink and leave.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.000]   They just drink and leave.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.320]   They drink from me and then they leave.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.040]   Jesus says, "The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.400]   up to eternal life."
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   Or that's John 4.14.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Here's John 7.38.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.720]   "Whoever believes in me, as the scripture said, out of his heart will flow rivers of
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.280]   living water."
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.300]   Now that's our calling and God is sufficient.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.040]   So be a spring.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   Be a spring.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.600]   Be a river.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.840]   And don't stop flowing when people drink and leave.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:35.040]   A never-ceasing spring is a beautiful witness to the all-sufficiency of Christ.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.080]   Here's one last thing.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   Maybe two.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.520]   I'll squish them into number four here about friendship.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:49.560]   Maybe just a few of those friends that have left, maybe you can keep them.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.440]   Maybe you can stay in touch for decades and cultivate a lifelong friendship over miles.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:02.800]   There are one or two people in my life that I count as precious friends.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.480]   We have been through some horrific things with each other who live far away from me
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.760]   now and I used to work with them decades ago and they're still precious.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.640]   And remember, I guess this would be the other of two things in my fourth one.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:26.320]   There is a friend, there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother, closer than a sister,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:33.560]   closer than a spouse, and he has promised never to leave you, Hebrews 13.5, and will
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.120]   always be with you to the end of the age, Matthew 28.20.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   Amen.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.560]   Thank you for this encompassing view of life that puts our loneliness and our friendships
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.460]   and our broken friendships all into perspective, Pastor John.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.160]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your week.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   Three times a week we publish and you can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.840]   past episodes in our archive and even reach us by email with a question of your own, even
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.800]   questions as it relate to relationship issues faced within your local church.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.720]   Though please keep it at the principal level.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.120]   We cannot address specific issues within a local church, obviously.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.200]   So keep it at the principal level like this very wisely worded question from Barb.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.160]   Barb, you did this really well.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   Thank you.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   Do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.440]   So with Christ's love for the church providing the typological pattern or the archetype as
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.840]   we say for a man's love of his wife, it's no surprise that we get a lot of emails from
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.240]   husbands who don't know if they're on the right track here.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.440]   What does this look like in our everyday lives to love a wife like Christ loved the church?
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.720]   That's on the docket on Monday on the other side of the weekend.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.320]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.480]   Thanks for listening and we'll see you then.
