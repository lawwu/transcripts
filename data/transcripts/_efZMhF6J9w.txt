[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.060]   On Monday, we looked at humor.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.260]   In what ways is a humorous personality a liability?
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.200]   That was APJ 1813.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.540]   The answer there was that humor can be stewarded well.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.460]   The key is developing sober-mindedness,
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.140]   an awareness that doesn't abolish humor,
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.740]   but puts humor in its place and protects things
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.500]   that are greater and more glorious.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.340]   To be sober-minded, as we saw, is to cultivate a demeanor
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.700]   that corresponds to the weight of the great things of life,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.780]   which means we must avoid being obsessed with humor
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.500]   to the point that we become incapable of serious moments
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.940]   and just allergic to them to the point
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.800]   that we become quick to break serious moments
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.140]   with injected humor.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.940]   In other words, we must learn to tremble before God.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060]   This word is especially relevant
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.020]   to the tone of our Sunday gatherings together,
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.020]   and that brings us to today.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860]   In the presence of God, everything trembles.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.980]   Everything trembles.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.540]   The earth trembles, according to Psalm 114.7.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.460]   Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.980]   at the presence of the God of Jacob.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.720]   The psalmist trembles in Psalm 119.120.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.020]   My flesh trembles for fear of you,
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.600]   and I am afraid of your judgments.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.780]   Indeed, the one who trembles at God's word,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.140]   that person, that person catches God's attention,
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.380]   according to what he tells us in Isaiah 66.2.
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.780]   But this is the one to whom I will look,
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.820]   he who is humble and contrite in spirit
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.620]   and who trembles at my word.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.680]   And in the New Testament, Paul calls us
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.860]   in Philippians 2.12, Christians,
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.860]   to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.700]   So why do Christians tremble?
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   Here's Pastor John to explain from a 2005 sermon.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.420]   - Here's Revelation 19.15.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.060]   From his mouth comes a sharp sword.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.220]   Now this is describing Jesus at his second coming.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.460]   From his mouth comes a sharp sword
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.060]   with which to strike down the nations,
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.340]   and he will rule them with a rod of iron.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.260]   He will tread the winepress of the fury
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680]   of the wrath of God the Almighty.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.620]   Now that last sentence is exceedingly terrible.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.900]   He will tread the winepress of the fury
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.420]   of the wrath of God the Almighty.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.180]   Just make four observations.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.060]   Number one, God is Almighty.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.260]   We are not dealing here with a mere president
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.780]   of the United States, the mere premier of China.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.340]   We're dealing here with the person
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.340]   whose power includes all the power of the political realm
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.940]   and all the power of the electromagnetic realm
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.820]   and all the power of the atomic realm
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.540]   and all the power of the gravitational pull
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.420]   of the biggest stars in the universe
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.900]   and all the power that upholds the universe
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.660]   by the word of his might.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.540]   We are dealing here with what's called
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.900]   Almighty, omnipotence, absolute sovereignty,
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.180]   and he is angry.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.900]   Second observation is that this Almighty God
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.440]   is about to pour out his wrath.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.340]   So he is a God of love, the Bible is clear about that,
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.860]   and he is also a God of justice and holiness and wrath.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.700]   The Bible is very clear about that.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.060]   We need to know God as he is, not as we make him up to be.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.900]   And the third observation is that
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.300]   this wrath is full of fury,
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.540]   the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.220]   It's not a cool opposition.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.500]   It's not emotionally indifferent.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.820]   It is a furiously angry wrath.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.740]   And the fourth observation, and it's the most terrible,
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.300]   is that it is like Christ treading a winepress
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.380]   in which the unbelieving are under his feet
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.300]   and their blood flows like wine from the winepress.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.300]   That's the image of the beloved apostle John, among others.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.260]   And my point today is this should produce
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.260]   a certain appropriate emotional response in us.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.340]   Psalm 114, verse seven,
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.380]   "Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.900]   at the presence of the God of Jacob."
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.420]   Psalm 119, verse 120,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.700]   "My flesh trembles for fear of you,
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.940]   and I am afraid of your judgments."
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.740]   That's a very godly man talking.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.740]   Isaiah 66, two, "This is the one to whom I will look,
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.740]   he who is humble," this is God talking,
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.180]   "This is the one to whom I will look,
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.500]   he who is humble and contrite in spirit
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.700]   and trembles at my word."
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.700]   God's countenance shines with favorable grace
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.100]   upon trembling people.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.820]   Or here's the New Testament testimony
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.660]   that we should all heed.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.940]   Philippians chapter two, verse 12,
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.940]   "Therefore, my beloved, as you have all ways obeyed,
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.500]   so now, not only in my presence,
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.660]   but much more in my absence,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.980]   work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.420]   To all believers, the Bible says,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.900]   get on the road that leads to life,
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.980]   and if necessary, cut off your hands to stay there,
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.180]   gouge out your eyes to stay there.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.100]   This is war all the way to heaven,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.100]   and as you go, let there be fear and trembling
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.540]   upon this road.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.220]   This is not something you grow out of
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.300]   as you get more mature as a Christian.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.940]   Oh, maybe you start afraid,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.420]   and then later on, there's no fear and trembling.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.780]   This is something that immature Christians
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.500]   must necessarily grow into,
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.100]   not something you grow out of.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.860]   To which you should perhaps respond,
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.260]   "But doesn't the Bible teach fear not?
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.980]   Dozens of places, doesn't it say,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.100]   'Fear not, for I am with you.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.620]   Be not dismayed, I am your God.'"
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.620]   So, what are you saying about the fear not passages
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.900]   if you're calling us to experience normal Christianity
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.540]   as fear and trembling?
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.700]   What's fear not mean?
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.340]   It means two things.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.140]   Number one, it means fear God, not man,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.660]   and number two, it means don't fear God as your enemy,
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.860]   fear Him as one who was your enemy,
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.340]   and who is very great.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.220]   Let me give you a text for each of those.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.060]   Fear God, not man, Matthew 10, 28.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.660]   "Do not fear those who kill the body,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.580]   but cannot kill the soul.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.580]   Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.820]   Here's the way I would put it.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.940]   Fear distrusting God.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.420]   Don't fear displeasing man.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.900]   Let it be a terrifying prospect to you
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.540]   to distrust your God.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.580]   But don't let it be at all a terrifying prospect to you
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.580]   to displease your enemy who might cut off your head.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.060]   That's all they can do is cut off your head.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.660]   But God, after the head has been cut off,
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.540]   can cast the soul into hell.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.540]   Yes, I tell you, fear distrusting God.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.580]   Fear turning away from God.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.300]   Isaiah 8, 12 put it this way.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.420]   This is a paradoxical verse.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.160]   "Do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread of them.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.980]   But the Lord of hosts, let Him be your fear.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.980]   Let Him be your dread, and He will become a sanctuary."
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.740]   It's like when Karsten visited Dick Teagan at age six,
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.740]   my son, and there was this big German shepherd
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.420]   who met him eye to eye in the doorway at age six.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.980]   And he was very much afraid.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.480]   And Dick said, "Don't be afraid, she's very friendly."
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.780]   We sent Karsten to the car to get something we'd forgotten.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.820]   And he went trotting out to the car,
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.500]   and this dog comes loping up behind him
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.420]   with a deep rumble in his voice.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.540]   It did not look like this dog was safe.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.820]   And Dick hollered out to Karsten,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.980]   "Oh, Karsten, better not run away from her.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.620]   She doesn't like people to run away from her."
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.720]   And I took mental note, "That's going into a sermon."
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.700]   Because that's exactly the way God is.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.860]   He's a very friendly God.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.420]   He just doesn't like people to run away from Him.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:57.260]   And He will lope after you with a deep rumble in His voice.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.540]   And if you don't heed that rumble and turn and hug His neck,
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.580]   you're gonna be history forever.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.100]   - Powerful illustration.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.180]   Piper goes on to apply holy trembling to corporate worship,
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.120]   and then to parenting, and then to evangelism.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.580]   He does all this in the sermon,
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.140]   "The Present Effects of Trembling at the Wrath of God,"
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.860]   preached on March 6, 2005.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.560]   It's available online at desiringgod.org in its entirety.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.580]   Well, if you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.580]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.580]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.980]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.500]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.940]   It's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.460]   Well, we're back on Friday with another Bible question,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.700]   I believe, I think it's this one, I might be wrong.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.420]   But we know that God tests us.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.180]   That's clear in James 1, 3 to 4,
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.140]   and in 1 Peter 1, 7.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.600]   But does God tempt us?
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.720]   James 1, 13 says no, God never tempts us.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.060]   But what's the difference between being tested by God
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.540]   and being tempted by God?
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.700]   A great question.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reike,
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.540]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.580]   when we return on Friday.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.500]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:31.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
