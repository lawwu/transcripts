[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, we have talked on this podcast about Satan.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Not a lot. We don't fixate on him.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   But we do talk about him and his designs, usually to look at what Satan
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   cannot do to us. There's a lot he can't do
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   to us as Christians because Christ has disarmed him in two
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   very important ways. We looked at this back in February in
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   B.J. 1750. Pastor John, today we're going to flip the question
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   and ask, "What can Satan do to Christians?"
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Peter warns believers that Satan seeks to devour
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   us, us believers, which raises two questions. One
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   from Russ in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He writes this, "Hello Pastor John, my question for
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   you is about 1 Peter 5, verses 8 and 9. Is Peter
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   saying that the devil seeks to devour us in and
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   through our suffering, or is he saying the constant
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   attacks of Satan are our suffering?"
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And Steve in Rochester, New York is asking about
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   this same text. Pastor John, "Hello, 1 Peter 5, 8 says that Satan is our enemy,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and I believe it. But enemies are opposed to us
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   in very specific ways, and I'm not clear about
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   this with Satan. My question is, how? How is
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Satan our enemy? Thank you." First,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   here's what the text says in 1 Peter 5,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   8 and 9. It says, "Be sober-minded, be
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   roaring lion seeking someone to devour. Resist him
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   suffering are being experienced by your
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   brotherhood throughout the whole world." So, Russ asks,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "Does the word 'sufferings' refer to
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   whatever Satan does to us, or does it refer
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   to actual Christian pain or suffering
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   which Satan is behind?" I think virtually all
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   interpreters agree that the second
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   is the right answer. Peter is referring to real sufferings of
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   various kinds that Christians are experiencing
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   throughout the world, and Satan is behind them, making
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   every effort to use those sufferings to destroy the faith of
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Christians. That's what "seeking to devour" means.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   He would succeed in devouring a Christian
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   if he could use those sufferings to cause us
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   to throw away our faith in the goodness and the wisdom
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and the care of God and
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   turn us against God. I think that's a
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   right interpretation about what "sufferings" refers to
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   first, because the other kinds of temptations that Satan
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   throws at us, like temptations to lust or covetousness
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   or pride, these kinds of temptations can
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   indeed devour people, and he's about them. But they're
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   not called "sufferings." So, not all
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   of Satan's attacks on us are called
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "sufferings." In fact, Satan is very good at attacking
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   us with pleasures as often as with sufferings.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   More people's faith, I would venture, is
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   devoured by being lured into sinful pleasure
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   as is devoured by sufferings.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Another reason that I think that interpretation is right,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   namely that Satan's particular strategy referred to here in
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   verse 9 is Christian suffering, is that Peter
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   had already referred to this in chapter 1, verses
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   6 and 7. He says, "Now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   you have been grieved through various trials
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   so that the tested genuineness of your faith, more precious
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   of Jesus Christ." So, he has already prepared
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   us at the very beginning of his letter that our
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   faith will be tested as with fire through these
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   various trials, that is, sufferings.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So, in answering Russ's question, I think
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   we're already in the middle of answering Steve's question, because
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Steve is asking, "Well, what are the specific ways
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   that this satanic lion
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   opposes us? How is he our enemy in
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   this text?" Now, the main answer we've seen is
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   by causing Christian suffering, which he
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   hopesâ€”I mean, his aim in causing that suffering is to deceive
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   us into believing that God is against us and not for
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   us, that God is helpless, perhaps,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   can't stop the suffering, poor God. In other words, by this
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   suffering, Satan aims to undermine our faith
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   in God's goodness or God's power or God's wisdom
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   or God's kindness. And if Satan can do
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   that, we will be devoured, destroyed
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   as Christians. We will make shipwreck of our faith
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and he will have won a tactical
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   victory. But we can be more specific
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   now in how Satan does this, because that's
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   what Steve is asking. I'll give
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   four examples of how Satan opposes
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Christians through suffering. First,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Satan is behind much, though not all,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   sickness. For example, after
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Jesus heals the woman bent over for 18 years, he
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   defends his action to the rulers by saying, "Ought not this
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   bound for 18 years,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?"
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   In other words, Satan is behind this disease, this
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   bent condition that this woman is in for 18 years.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We see an example of this in the lives of Christians
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   in 2 Corinthians 12, verse 7, where Paul had
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   been given those amazing visions, remember? And Paul explains
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   how God designed, planned
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to keep him from getting conceited by these visions.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Here's verse 7 of 2 Corinthians 12.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   "So to keep me from becoming conceited
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   a thorn was given to me in the flesh,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   a messenger of Satan to harass
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   me, to keep me from being conceited."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   This is especially important because here we
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   have both the activity of God and
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   the activity of Satan. We know that Satan did not
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   aim at preventing Paul's pride. He wants
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Paul to be conceited. He wants to destroy his faith with pride.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Saving Paul from conceit was God's purpose.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   God aimed to keep Paul humble and holy.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And yet, the instrument of God's
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   sanctifying work is called a messenger
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   of Satan. That's amazing. So what we learn
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   is that even when Satan is bringing about
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   some kind of thorn or suffering
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   in the life of a Christian, he's not sovereign.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   He's not ultimate. He's under God's supervision. And while
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Satan's design is the destruction of Paul's faith,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   God's design is the strengthening of Paul's faith and the preservation
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   of his holiness and his humility. But there's another
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   way that Satan brings about the suffering of Christians.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   He sometimes throws them into prison.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Revelation 2.10, "Do not fear what you are about
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   some of you into prison, that you may be tested,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And we ask, "Well, how might
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Satan do that? How does Satan do that? How does
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   he throw Christians into prison?"
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And one answer is, the same way he threw Jesus
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   under arrest in the garden. The same way
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   he threw Jesus on the cross.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   How did that happen? Here's John 13.2,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   "During supper, the devil had
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Simon's son, to betray him."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Then verse 27, "After Judas had taken the morsel,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Satan entered into him.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And Jesus said to him, 'What you are going to do,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   do quickly.' And he went out and betrayed Jesus."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   As it were, threw him in prison. Worse.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   We can assume that sort of thing happens regularly
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   to cause Christians much suffering.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Satan puts it in the heart of people to betray
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Christians or to lie about Christians
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and so bring them into suffering, whether prison or some other consequence.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So I conclude that
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   in 1 Peter 5, 8, and 9, the lion's
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   roar, this roaring lion going about trying to devour people,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   the lion's roar is the roar
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   of Satan's effort to strike fear into Christians
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   by the suffering he brings into their lives. He aims for that fear
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   to destroy their faith. We know from 2 Corinthians 12
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   and from the story of Job 1 and from the fact that
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Jesus commands demons and they obey him that Satan is not
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   sovereign. God is.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Wherever Satan is acting, he's acting
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   by permission, not because he has ultimate control.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Nevertheless, he's real. Oh, he is
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   real. He is strong. He's evil. He's on a
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   long leash. Under God's providence, he does
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   terrible damage. Therefore,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Peter does not say, "Ho-hum.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   God is sovereign." He says,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   "Be sober. Be watchful. Resist.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Resist. Firm in your faith.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Fight. That is, take up the sword of the Spirit,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   the Word of God, and stick Satan in face
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   with it. Believe God's promise
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and stand your ground. Do not
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   be sucked into Satan's temptation that God is evil or
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   that God is weak. Let the fires of suffering
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   purify and strengthen your faith,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   not destroy it." Stick Satan
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   in the face with the Word. So good. Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   joining us today. We're going to break for the weekend now, and when the weekend is over,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   we will get back to work. And back to work, thinking
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   about work and how we can be most fruitful by leaning on
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   good administrative structures. We've never talked about this angle of leadership
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   in the podcast. We should. It should be interesting. How do we build
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   the structures in place that we need so that we can maximize our
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   fruitfulness to our calling in the world? That
