[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980]   It's one of those things in life where everyone kind of feels like they want to buy a home
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.640]   because we've all been told our entire lives that it's the American Dream.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.980]   If something has been marketed to you your entire life, it probably feels like a very
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.280]   genuine desire, but like, what is it about ownership that is so appealing to you?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.040]   Because your name is going to be on the deed and not the lease.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   When I was in my early 20s, I was like, "Oh my God, I'm throwing money away on rent."
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.080]   It was beginning to start that process that actually kind of opened my eyes to be like,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080]   "Wait a second.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.680]   The property taxes, the HOA fees, like insurance.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.160]   No one ever told me about that stuff.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160]   Like what?"
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.940]   I had so internalized the narrative that renting was throwing money away that it was impossible
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.960]   to conceive that like continuing to just rent was actually more cost effective and going
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.560]   to allow me to save and invest more money and grow more wealth than buying this condo.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.900]   We just looked and in all but like a couple cities in America, it is cheaper to rent than
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900]   to buy.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.360]   Part of that is high prices, but a big part of that is interest rates.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.160]   The fact that interest rates are so high right now has forced the conversation to be like,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.120]   "Maybe it's actually not a good deal."
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.680]   Whenever I hear people talk about the correlation between net worth and homeownership, the causality
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.840]   is presumed that it's, "Oh, well, owning makes you richer."
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.920]   But I think it's the opposite that just richer people tend to buy their homes.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.080]   Katie, thanks for being here in person.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080]   Oh my goodness.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.480]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.340]   We've had all these phone calls and now we're finally meeting in person.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.080]   We're having this little day in Napa Valley.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.720]   I attribute this to a guy named Chris Powers who has a podcast called The Fort and he lives
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   in Dallas.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.800]   He was like, "Well, when I have guests on, I'm going to have them come to Dallas and
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.640]   I'm going to like make a day out of it."
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.680]   So you drove down here, went out.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   You've never been to Napa.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.600]   We went out for lunch.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920]   We're currently staying at our Picasso up in Napa.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.720]   So we're here for the week, halfway in between.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   I don't know.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   We had a good little time.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   I'm having a great time.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.880]   I don't even feel like I'm on a podcast right now.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.720]   I feel like I'm just continuing to hang out with you.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.820]   Well, it's funny because this topic of renting versus buying, which we'll get right to, like
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.640]   we started talking about it casually at lunch.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.140]   I was like, "Oh, we're going to record this conversation.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.740]   Let's just do it."
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.140]   So I'm curious because when I was doing research, I was like, "I want to do an episode on rent
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.140]   versus buy.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.360]   I wonder if there's anyone I know who's as passionate about this topic."
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.580]   And I was like, "Wow, Katie's done like four episodes on this topic over the years.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.940]   What is it about this that just gets you fired up?"
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.400]   There is something about it that gets me fired up, and I think it's because it's one of those
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.060]   things in personal finance where there's nothing quite so emotional that strikes that chord
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.080]   with people where the misconception of expectation and reality are so divergent.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.980]   So by that, I basically mean the narrative around homeownership as a wealth building
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.560]   mechanism is so darn strong, and we can talk about why that is.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.860]   But the reality of what it usually looks like in your most average case for someone who
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.260]   buys a home instead of rents it doesn't really live up to the hype in most cases.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:19.060]   And so I just find it to be one of those frustrating topics financially where you can lay out the
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.060]   math for someone.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.500]   You can show them in a spreadsheet, "This is what will happen if you do this.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.280]   This is what will happen if you do that."
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.180]   And for whatever reason, it's like if someone has made up their mind that owning is better,
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.660]   there is no amount of math.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.800]   There are no projections that will talk that person out of that decision.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.900]   It's just so interesting because there's really nothing else in personal finance that I think
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.220]   people cling to so strongly.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.140]   Yeah, maybe the magnitude of the cost makes it even more emotional.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.620]   The fact that it's also something that I think our parents give us advice on more than maybe
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.060]   any other financial topic, I think real estate.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.700]   The thing that drives me nuts about this decision of rent versus buy is that it seems so based
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.020]   in other people's opinions about what happened to them and not based on the comparison.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.940]   So it's like, "Oh, I bought a home and I made a lot of money."
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.980]   And it's like, "Well, you made the money over 30 years.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.360]   Maybe you had to renovate your house.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.820]   Maybe if you had just invested it in the stock market, it would have done just as better
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.100]   or even better."
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.020]   And so it seems like people's advice on the topic, broadly speaking, is just based on...
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.020]   It's anecdotal.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.020]   And so it's not...
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.980]   They didn't run a model to say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.220]   Had we just invested all this money and rented all along, we would have done just as well.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.660]   It's just we did well."
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.660]   Exactly.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.460]   Because you are assuming that that was the best path, you're really not thinking about
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.220]   the counterfactual wherein something else would have happened.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.500]   And in some cases, it would be impossible to run that type of counterfactual because
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.620]   you probably weren't tracking rent prices that entire time.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.940]   Data-wise, it's perfect.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.860]   Even if I could say, "Okay, we're talking about this specific zip code.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.380]   We can go back in time and actually look up what the average rent was for the type of
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.700]   home that you lived in for those 30 years, and we can run the numbers and whatever."
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.340]   But in that case, I find that people be like, "Yeah, but then I would have had to move a
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.340]   lot."
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.900]   And it almost just doesn't matter.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:29.300]   So I guess it's my selfish and hard-headed one woman's journey to try to get people to
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.140]   think about it differently because I used to be the person that felt like, "Oh, if I'm
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.680]   25 years old and I'm still a renter," now that's laughable, but when I was in my early
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.220]   20s, I was like, "Oh my God, I'm throwing money away on rent."
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.960]   And it was beginning to go down that road and beginning to start that process and looking
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.500]   at condos in Dallas, Texas, and starting the pre-approval process and what have you, that
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.020]   actually kind of opened my eyes to be like, "Wait a second.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.060]   There is so much more to this that no one ever tells you."
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.860]   For example, the property taxes in Dallas, Texas are 2% per year.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.120]   So here I am going on my merry way thinking, "Oh, I'll put 10% down on this condo.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   This is great.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.960]   I'll have someone else live in it, pay me rent.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   What could be easier?
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.680]   I've got life figured out."
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.800]   And then come to find out, I'm already in the pre-approval process looking at a specific
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.280]   condo and the real estate agent's like, "Okay, so the property taxes, the HOA fees, insurance,"
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.920]   she starts going through all the other things, and I was like, "No one ever told me about
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   that stuff.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   I've never heard of it."
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.180]   And I find that that is kind of a common experience.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.520]   But for me, it was like my, it like radicalized me.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.600]   I was like, "Wait a second."
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Changed on a dime.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   Changed on a dime.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   Oh, absolutely not.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.960]   I couldn't afford it in the first place.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.520]   That was why the entire thing was kind of so comical in retrospect.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.920]   I was like, "What money did I think that I had to even be doing that in the first place?"
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.300]   I had so internalized the narrative that renting was throwing money away, that it was impossible
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.680]   to conceive that continuing to just rent for $700 a month, whatever I was doing at the
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.160]   time, was actually more cost-effective and going to allow me to save and invest more
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.840]   money and grow more wealth than buying this condo and having the unrecoverable costs probably
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.120]   exceed the rent that I was paying at the time.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.320]   It's funny because the throwing money away on rent, we've heard it a bajillion times,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.160]   and I'm thinking, "Oh, well today, guess what?
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.060]   We threw away money when we bought lunch."
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.460]   To go back to your point about property tax, I throw away a lot of money.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.660]   We own and we throw away money on proper tax.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.700]   We throw away money on insurance.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.340]   We throw away money on mortgage interest.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.260]   Sure, some of that mortgage interest is a tax deduction, but we throw money away on
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.580]   maintenance, on repairs, on renovations.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.780]   All of those things are throwing money away.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.500]   When you actually compare it and say, "Let's strip out all the money you throw away on
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.260]   a home and then look at the delta between how much you spent and if you rented," and
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.500]   here I think is the big reason why a lot of people made money in real estate is, yes,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.740]   renting might have been cheaper, but the assumption that they will be on par is that you also
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.460]   invest the difference.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.660]   When you have a mortgage, if you don't want to get kicked out of your house, you have
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.500]   to make your mortgage payment.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.180]   Part of that mortgage payment with a traditional loan is that you're paying the principal down.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.660]   The sad truth is that in the first, I don't know the exact numbers, but it's like in the
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   first-
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.660]   Basically the first 10 years.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.620]   You're paying down almost none.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.820]   I mean, you're paying a little bit down, but the vast majority of all the money you pay
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.980]   each month goes to your interest.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.900]   But in the long run, over 30 years, you pay the house down.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.100]   When you rent, in the long run, unless you also invest money, you will be left with nothing.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.100]   Of course.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:09:00.820]   I think that that forced savings device argument for ownership is a compelling one, I think.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.480]   If you are a person that does not really have a strong track record of being able to force
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.060]   yourself to save and invest, that wasn't really my problem.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:18.020]   I'm a pretty good saver and investor, and so I didn't feel like, "Oh, if I don't buy
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:25.220]   a house, it doesn't matter that only," we'll call it, "20% of my outgoing funds that I'm
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:33.060]   spending are actually staying in my pocket, and the other 80% are going to the local municipality,
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.260]   the insurance company, the bank."
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.180]   At that point, I'll just save the 100% myself, or whatever percentage is the delta between
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.900]   the rent and the ownership cost, and keep the down payment invested.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:55.620]   The funny thing is that that dilemma, for me, was actually playing out at a time where
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.340]   the interest rates were such that it was pretty easy to make the numbers work for owning,
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.380]   because the interest rates were less than 4%.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:09.220]   Now, it's so funny to see, now that rates are above 6% and 7%, it's like people are
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.300]   discovering amortization calculators for the first time, like, "You'll never believe how
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.140]   much this house is actually going to cost you."
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.540]   I'm like, "Has no one looked this up before?"
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.740]   This has always been true.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:24.900]   It's just that money used to basically be free, but now you really just can't ignore
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.380]   it.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.980]   It's no longer a little bit at the margin.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.820]   It's like, "Oh, no.
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:36.820]   The mortgage payment is $2,500, of which $2,000 is interest.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:44.100]   Okay, well, now this choice doesn't look so obvious anymore."
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.540]   Do you listen to Ben and Cameron on Rational Reminder?
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.740]   They have really great rent versus buy content, particularly because if you know anything
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.980]   about Canada's real estate market, it's kind of like the US, but worse, where they also
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.740]   are experiencing really hot real estate numbers, but they didn't have the equivalent of a
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.220]   2008-style correction.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.420]   So, theirs was going up then and has been going up the entire time and didn't have that
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:20.260]   huge five-year dip that then they had to climb back out of, so it's even worse in Canada.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.540]   And one point that they made that I thought was so fascinating was that paradoxically,
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.900]   the time that it is most expensive for you to be a homeowner is when you own your home
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.500]   outright, because that's when the opportunity cost is highest.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.100]   You would think it's most expensive in the beginning, in this period that we're talking
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.420]   about, where you are paying, you are outlaying so much cash, and such a small fraction of
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.780]   it is building equity.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.100]   The rest is no different than rent in that sense.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:54.420]   But they made the point that because over time, you're probably not going to see property
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.180]   appreciation in excess of like four or five percent.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.500]   It's just keeping pace with inflation.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.820]   For the most part, it's not really going to be all that impressive.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.700]   It's most expensive to you as the homeowner when so much of your net worth is in this
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:15.220]   thing that is just keeping up with inflation, maybe a little bit in excess of it.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.980]   And I thought that was so interesting.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:22.340]   So I'm like, yeah, I mean, the other people's money aspect or the fact that you're levered
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:30.260]   when you buy is in some ways the most expensive part of it, but also the part that can make
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.300]   it work.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:38.660]   Because in that first, I don't know, when not so much of your money is tied up in it
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:45.620]   and you've made this levered bet on the fact that it's going to go up, your net worth is
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.660]   increasing at a disproportionate rate because of that, if the property is, in fact, rising
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.380]   in value.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.660]   Yeah, when I see people defend buying, obviously, if you're there for a really long time and
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.180]   you pick right or you get lucky, those are great cases.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.380]   But some of the defenses are, okay, mortgage interest is tax deductible.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.500]   Okay, but if you own your house outright, there's no mortgage interest, that doesn't
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.060]   apply.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.820]   Only matters to you, are you paying in excess of, you know, you're a married couple, are
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.980]   you spending more than $29,000 a year on mortgage interest and property taxes?
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.580]   Because if you're not, you're just better off taking the standard deduction anyway.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.340]   Is that the payment doesn't change and that you have a fixed payment, whereas rent, you
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.420]   can assume is going to go up over time.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.420]   Though can go down, like people were negotiating their rent down during the pandemic and other
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.060]   times.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.180]   Some people I know have said, look, I think I'm going to live here two years, I'll negotiate
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.100]   my rent down if I commit for two years.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.220]   Maybe one other case was what you said about leverage, right?
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.700]   If we can make the claim, and I think data shows it, that your property is probably not
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.220]   going to appreciate at the same historical rate as the stock market.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.140]   That's just like hasn't ever happened.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.180]   Maybe in one or two years it will happen, but over the long run it hasn't.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.700]   So if you can't lever up your investment, then it doesn't make sense.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.460]   And so to your point about owning the entire house being the most expensive time, that
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:05.860]   makes sense.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.620]   There's no leverage, there's no tax deduction.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.700]   And in the last case, I guess if you sell your house, you do get, as a married couple,
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.860]   up to $500,000 of tax-free gains.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.460]   That's nice.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.620]   That's pretty, I would say that's one of the more compelling reasons.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.580]   And also, I mean, to be fair, you can't live inside an index fund.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.940]   So I see the point that people will make, which is like, well, I have to live somewhere.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:40.340]   And if one path is going to all things considered equal, all things the same, if one path is
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.380]   eventually going to lead to me having this asset that I can sell for a profit that is
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.460]   functionally operating the same way as a piggy bank, where some of the money that I'm paying
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:57.940]   for it is going to stay inside it and I can turn around later and benefit from that, then
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.580]   great.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.100]   I agree that that's maybe the optimal path.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:08.180]   The problem right now, as far as I can see it, is that the rental market and the buyer's
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.260]   market are so distorted.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.220]   They are so out of whack with one another.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.100]   To a degree that I don't, I don't want to say historically that we've never seen, because
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.820]   that's not true.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.100]   I think this has happened at least one other time in the 21st century where the gap was
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   so dramatic, but it's almost laughable how much cheaper it is in most places to rent
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.300]   and invest the difference than to become an owner.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.420]   And I think with any asset, most investors probably realize that the price you pay for
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.300]   the asset is going to in some way determine the return that you get.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:54.420]   So if I buy Amazon at $10 a share or $200 a share, obviously my return is going to be
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.580]   greater if I'm getting in at $10 a share.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:02.260]   So unlike an index fund, you cannot dollar cost average into a house.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.500]   You lock in the price when you buy it.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.780]   So right now with things being so inflated and with the buyer's market being so much
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:15.460]   more expensive than the rental market, it's not in all things considered the same, all
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.700]   things considered equal equation right now.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.060]   Things are not equal at all.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.060]   Renting is so much cheaper.
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.140]   I'm going to push back really briefly and just say, right now things are expensive.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.300]   And I think we just looked and in all but like a couple cities in America, it is cheaper
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.740]   to rent than to buy.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.900]   In almost every major city and in the area where right now in the Bay Area, it's probably
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.500]   the most ludicrously more expensive place to buy than rent.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:44.340]   Part of that is high prices, but a big part of that is interest rates.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.580]   And dollar cost average, maybe not the right term, but you can refinance your mortgage
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.260]   at a future date if interest rates drop.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.900]   Fair point.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.860]   So I think that if you were to buy a house today, let's use an extreme example that I
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.580]   think is very unlikely, and interest rates drop to 2% tomorrow and you refinance tomorrow
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.900]   on your house, you might be in a situation where over the next 10 years, it actually
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.100]   was cheaper to buy.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:13.860]   I think a lot of these rent versus buy comparisons right now are looking at 7% interest rates
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.100]   and at that rate, it's really crazy.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.260]   So if you had some crystal ball that said interest rates are going to drop to zero tomorrow,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.580]   you might be better off buying and refinancing.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.660]   However, that doesn't look likely.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:31.460]   If you look at the predictions for Fed Funds rates, yes, they're predicting a rate cut
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.460]   this year, but like not a big rate cut.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.100]   And I don't know, you know, it's not that the Fed Funds rate is the mortgage rate, but
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.820]   Have you ever refinanced?
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.380]   They're trending.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.260]   Yes.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.820]   Okay.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.100]   So what was the closing cost situation like when you did that?
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.580]   It was not that high.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.860]   So we didn't even mention closing costs.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.940]   By the way, other things you throw money away when you buy a home, you throw, you know,
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.860]   anywhere from 1% to 3% on your closing costs.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:59.940]   But the biggest one is you're paying probably depending where you live, 5% to 6% in broker's
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.980]   fees when you sell.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.460]   Right.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.700]   Now, when you buy, you're effectively paying that fee.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:09.140]   Also, you're just not the one who outlays it, but it's factored into the price, which
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.900]   is why this, you know, class action lawsuit, this kind of scrappy lawyer out of Missouri
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.380]   who challenged the National Association of Realtors, 6% commission.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.780]   And that to me, this, the fact that now this commission is getting struck down and there
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.780]   are all these copycat, this copycat litigation in different states that are trying to say
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:34.820]   the same thing is fascinating because it just is a perfect example of like the externalities
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:40.020]   that are going to impact what happens to housing prices over time that going into this year,
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.900]   you probably never thought of.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.900]   There are some variables that we're all aware of.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.980]   Like what is the fed funds right?
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.580]   Can it do our interest rates going to go down?
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.060]   I don't know.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:53.780]   Maybe we think we know what's going to impact the rent versus by equation, but this lawsuit
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:19:00.740]   kind of came out of nowhere and if all of a sudden a fixed price, a fixed fee of 6%
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:06.420]   that used to be to your point, baked into the price of every home sale is now gone.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.220]   Of course, that's going to impact prices.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:14.420]   And they're thinking that it could, you could see kind of a universal softening across the
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:20.020]   board because now you don't have to pay this 6% commission as the seller to your agent
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.460]   and to your, your, um, buyer's agent.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.420]   So I don't know, it's just an interesting, to me, I just kind of shows that we, we, you
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.540]   never know what is going to change nationally, but also like in the town that you're trying
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:39.540]   to buy in and how that could radically shift this assessment for you and what makes more
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.020]   sense.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.460]   But I was asking about closing costs specifically because I always hear people talk about refinancing
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:50.820]   as like, well, yeah, you date the rate, you marry the house, you marry the price, you
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.460]   date the rate.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.780]   And like the implication of course, is that you can just get a lower rate later, but I,
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:00.020]   I rarely hear people acknowledge the fact that you have to pay closing costs again,
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.180]   this isn't like a free transaction.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.340]   And so I'm curious what that experience was like for you.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.740]   So I'm looking at our refinance right now.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:15.220]   And there were $50 credit report, $13 flood certification.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:23.620]   Unfortunately, these don't get summed up $135 tax service, $735 appraisal fee, $25 title
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:30.820]   insurance and other almost $1,700 title fees, $400 recording fee.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.180]   So that's not bad at all for the value of the property.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.620]   Add all that up, maybe it's a few thousand dollars.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.100]   Someone listening probably has a, has the kind of memory.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.300]   It's like, I know exactly that number.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.940]   I was, but I was under the impression that it was a set percent, the same way that closing
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.420]   costs when you initially buy a home can be.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.860]   So it really depends.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.620]   The first mortgage we ever had, we had bought a house in San Francisco is classified as
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.500]   what's called a TIC.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.620]   It was a tenancy in common.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.820]   So we actually, we bought a two bedroom condo, but it was not a condo.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.020]   It was a TIC, very different with another couple.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.500]   So we all owned the two units together and we had a legal agreement between us about
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.020]   how we would share them.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.620]   Basically, we would only inhabit ours.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.500]   They would inhabit theirs.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.060]   But technically, if they stopped paying their monthly fees, we're on the hook because there
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.020]   were four of us on the title.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.260]   It was very financially intimate because we were like, we're going to buy a house with
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:24.340]   you.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.620]   So we need to see your balance sheet.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.540]   We need to see everything because, and we all put in three months of mortgage payments
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.500]   in advance.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.140]   And every time the mortgage was paid, we had to put another month in.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.700]   So you would kind of get a three month headstart as if someone was going to miss.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:44.180]   But when we refinance that, the loan we had had a 1% early termination fee effectively.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.340]   So when we went to refinance, we had to pay 1%.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:52.340]   So if you were to have a loan with these kind of 1%, I don't remember what the exact name
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.140]   of that fee was.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:59.620]   Yeah, you would have had to pay 1%, but I did not have to, but I did not have to.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.500]   And I've actually heard, I think it's called recasting.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.140]   And this is where I think there is also a recasting that could somehow have lower fees.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.580]   There are some financial institutions that I think have very, very low fee refinances.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:18.980]   And so I imagine when interest rates drop, there will be a massive fight for banks to
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.620]   refinance.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.020]   There will be plenty of people who want to refinance.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.500]   And I imagine that there will be some competition.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.780]   So I could see those costs going down.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.420]   Interesting.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:28.660]   Okay.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.700]   I could see that too.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.460]   You know, we did an interesting, um, well, two things.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:33.860]   Okay.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:42.580]   So one thing that this is bringing up for me is I'm thinking about generations past and
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:48.820]   kind of this claim that real estate is, or rather, let me be more specific because I
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.460]   think sometimes you hear real estate, you, it brings to mind people who are investing
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.420]   in real estate.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.340]   As in I buy this house, I'm renting it out to someone else.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.460]   It's going to cashflow.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.980]   I'm having my costs covered.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.100]   Someone else is paying down the mortgage and maybe I'm skimming off a little bit of the
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.500]   top every month, or, you know, I have some like net income on that transaction.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.580]   That is very different than I am buying a primary residence that I am going to live
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.380]   in and pay for.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:21.460]   And so when I think about the generations of the past and how they were able to build
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.660]   wealth and what they had available to them, as it compares to what young people today
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.860]   have available to them.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:34.660]   I think the big difference is that your average young professional in the eighties and nineties
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:40.900]   had a much steeper road to other public investments.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:47.140]   They did not have a supercomputer in their pocket that they could place a $0, $0 commission,
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.100]   $0 fee trade and buy the S&P 500 in five minutes.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.780]   That wasn't really a thing.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:59.940]   And so I think about homeownership for that demographic or for that that group of people
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.380]   in history as like, well, yeah, it probably was your best option at that time.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:10.660]   It was probably one of the only realistic ways that you could really build wealth easily.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.100]   And I think that as the options for wealth building and the ability to decouple our need
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.620]   from shelter, from our interest in building wealth, as that becomes more and more available
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.940]   to anyone who has a smartphone and some like extra money on the side that that housing
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:33.380]   looks less and less attractive as like the primary means by which you build wealth.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.300]   But all that to say, it doesn't surprise me when I hear people in my parents' generation
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.900]   say, oh, you should always buy a house.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.940]   It's going to make you wealthy.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.180]   It's like, well, yeah, because for them, it probably did.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:42.680]   But like.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:49.860]   That has not been the experience of, I'll say, my generation or our generation, we did
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:57.220]   a really interesting study with our audience or we surveyed like almost a thousand people
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.940]   and basically asked them about their housing costs and their incomes and their net worths.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:08.820]   And while more of our audience in this respondent pool owns rather than rents,
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:15.780]   the monthly median cost for the owners was twenty six hundred dollars per month
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.020]   compared to two thousand dollars a month for the renters, which obviously we're not
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.980]   we're not controlling for size of dwelling or what have you.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.180]   But I did think that that was interesting that they're spending more.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.140]   The median age of the owners was about four years older.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.340]   They were thirty four compared to the median age of the renters, which was thirty.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.300]   But this was what was really, really blew my mind, just that the median
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.620]   like household income was so much higher for the owners compared to the renters.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.740]   So when we look at their net worths, yes, the owners were richer,
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.460]   but they they were spending more on housing.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.660]   They just had more money.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.180]   They had more income.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.060]   And so whenever I hear people talk about the correlation between net worth and homeownership,
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:00.500]   the causality is presumed that it's, oh, well, owning makes you richer.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.380]   But I think it's the opposite, that just richer people tend to buy their homes.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:11.860]   And based on the incomes and costs that we saw in our survey data set, like, yeah,
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.060]   I mean, it kind of tracks like intuitively, it makes sense.
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.500]   But I would say that it was also supported in what we saw from our
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.580]   survey filler outers, our hand raisers.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:28.660]   It's funny, because when you first started saying that, I was thinking that there was a reason why
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:35.140]   the owners would buy a bigger place or spend more than the renters, not just comparison of costs.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.340]   But I've always found that there's this rule of thumb.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.220]   It's like, don't buy a home unless you're going to live there for ten years.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.140]   And I'd say the primary reason behind that is this broker's fee, right?
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.140]   You're going to have a 5% loss.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   And if you buy a home and try to sell it next year, and you've got to take a 5%, 6% loss,
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.900]   and the closing costs up front, it doesn't make sense.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.980]   Now, if we can get rid of that, that actually could change that rule of thumb.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.340]   I have a friend who was selling a place in Miami.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.900]   And I actually told him, I said, hey, you know what?
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.020]   Why don't you propose something crazy to your realtor?
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.220]   Because why not?
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.500]   And I've always wanted to try this.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:16.020]   And he said, I'm going to say, I'll give you X percent if you sell it at list,
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.820]   but I'll ratchet it up if you sell it above.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.180]   So it went all the way up to 9%.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.740]   And it went down to 3% if they sold below the price that they thought they could.
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.380]   And it turns out they got an offer and they took it.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.980]   And they didn't get to actually test this.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.060]   But I was really excited to see, because a model that would make a lot more sense to me
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.060]   isn't give you 6% for selling the house.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.420]   It's like, give you a performance fee if you do a really great job
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.860]   and are able to get a better price.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.940]   And you get less fee if you don't.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.180]   But that's a little bit of a tangent.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.540]   Where I was going with this was because of that rule of thumb,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.580]   I see people that are young, they're looking at buying a home.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.740]   And they're like, well, we have to live here 10 years to make buying a home a good deal.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.340]   We want to live in a pretty nice house.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.620]   Yeah, we need a place that when we have kids, we can fill it out.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.300]   And so this was our thinking when we first bought a house, we had no children.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.460]   And we were like, well, if we're going to live here long enough
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.340]   for this to be a financially good deal, we need a house that we can have kids in.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.060]   So we need at least, let's call it three bedrooms.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.140]   Well, we didn't need three bedrooms for like five years.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.460]   So had we bought a place with three bedrooms versus rented,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.660]   for renting, we would have just had a one bedroom for the next five years.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.700]   And then we might have upgraded.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.220]   But for buying, because we knew we had to be there for so long,
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.700]   we were like pre-buying space we didn't need.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.660]   And so that would have been a very...
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.780]   So I think this problem of pre-buying space is something,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.380]   oh, I want to buy my forever home.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.540]   So I have to buy the home that I wouldn't necessarily rent a comparable home for.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.220]   And then I do the math and I say, oh, well, I'm spending three grand a month now.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.740]   Like you can't compare apples to apples unless you look at the same kind of house.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.620]   But also I actually want to push back.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.060]   Sometimes people say, well, do the rent versus buy with comparable properties.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.660]   And I say, well, if you're only going to rent a one bedroom for three years,
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.500]   and then you're going to switch to a two bedroom for three years,
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.060]   and then maybe a three bedroom in three more years,
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.740]   we'll compare that kind of whole picture
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.580]   because you wouldn't actually have to rent the comparable three bedroom for a while.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.220]   And what we ended up doing was we found a place, it was random.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.420]   We were just going around.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.460]   We saw this house and it had a separate entrance on the master bedroom,
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.060]   and it was on a separate floor.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.580]   And we were like, what if we lock off that floor and we rent it out?
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.540]   So we basically bought a three bedroom,
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.820]   but for five or six years, it was just a two bedroom.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.220]   So we only lived and we rented out the other room.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.420]   So we were able to commit to, we're going to live in this place for 10 years.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.860]   It ended up being about eight or nine years,
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.420]   but we were committed to live to it for a really long time.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.180]   But we were able to not pay the price for the space we thought we would need in the future.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.940]   Then we ended up decorating.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.780]   We had a nursery, we had a kid, and then we moved out,
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.420]   like right after having our first child.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.260]   The thing about buying your primary residence that I think
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.740]   is maybe the sticking point for me is that
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.380]   I think there is a really smart way to do it.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.980]   One of those ways is what you just described,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:12.180]   which is using it in some capacity to create more income for you.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.060]   So like we rent a very nice home in California,
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.380]   but there is something in our lease agreement that says like,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.780]   you can't Airbnb out this house, but we travel a fair bit.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.620]   It would be pretty nice if we could, right?
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.780]   But like, that's not our decision to make.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.220]   So if you're someone who is willing to get creative
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.020]   and you're like, "Ah, I'll just, you know, lock off this part of the house,"
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.620]   or "Oh, I'm just going to rent a bedroom out."
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.100]   I mean, those are great ways to shift this equation very quickly.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.780]   The other thing that I would say is I think
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:48.900]   the problem or what I always try to dissuade particularly young people from doing
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:54.020]   is kind of going into this transaction with blinders on
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:59.300]   as though like this is just what I am supposed to do at this phase in my life.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.540]   And like the moment that I feel like I could eke out a down payment
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.780]   and like spend 45% of my take-home pay on that mortgage payment,
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.620]   I'm going to go for it and pull the trigger because this is my ticket to wealth.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:17.540]   I have just heard from so many listeners of the podcast, readers of the blog,
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.820]   people in our community who basically say,
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.540]   "Hey, I bought this house. I used all my savings for the down payment.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.260]   Like I have nothing left in my emergency fund or I have very little left in my emergency fund.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.100]   I'm spending almost half of my net income on it every month.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.380]   I feel really spread thin. I feel really stretched.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.060]   Like I can't really, I have no discretionary income anymore.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.580]   I live in stress that something is going to break and I can't afford it."
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.980]   I'm like, "Who wants to be in that position?"
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:53.460]   Like that situation is not going to pay off for that person for a very long time.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.420]   And that's an if.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.980]   Like if the property continues to appreciate,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.180]   they better hope they didn't buy in an area that's like on a downswing
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:05.060]   because in that case, they're kind of struggling and scrimping for nothing.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.020]   And so I think if you want to buy and you can comfortably afford it,
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:15.300]   like you are in a financial position where you are operating from a position of strength
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.780]   and to your point about renting out the room, like kind of creativity
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:25.220]   or we'll say just like general savviness, I think it can make a great deal of sense.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:33.060]   It's just problematic for me when the situation or the decision is approached
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.540]   as kind of like a black and white.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.020]   I almost look at it in some ways as like the decision to go to college today.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.180]   Like, yeah, a college degree is probably going to help you.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.140]   Like if you just look at the data and like, you know,
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.620]   incomes associated with level of schooling, is it smart to go to college?
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.500]   Yes.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:33:00.900]   And also, should you spend $50,000 a year out of state to go to a state school
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.300]   and study something where your starting salary is going to be
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.740]   $45,000 and also take out a ton of debt?
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.740]   Like the circumstances around the choice matter.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.180]   What you spend on it matters.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.660]   The sacrifice you have to make to make it happen.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:14.900]   Right.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.580]   What you want to do with it matters.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:22.420]   And so I think that it's just that kind of like binary, buying is always good.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   Going to college is always the right choice.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:30.580]   It's like, no, there are many ways to turn both of those things into financial nightmares
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:35.060]   if you're not approaching it in a strategic and thoughtful way.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.420]   And it can be really stressful because I know the peer pressure.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.780]   I have two anecdotes.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:46.100]   One was we had a friend and it was another couple and they were hoping to buy a home.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.860]   We had bought our first home.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.140]   And I'm not even kidding.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.740]   And that was the real estate arms race.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.140]   They're like.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:56.420]   Well, one of the couple was like, I don't think that it makes sense for us to hang out anymore
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.620]   because like, we just don't like being around.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.340]   Like you knew we wanted to buy a home and then you went and bought a home.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.340]   And now it was like this weird.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.500]   It became a thing in this relationship with this other couple where they were like,
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.860]   we just like now is not the right time for us to keep hanging out because we're kind
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.300]   of frustrated that you were able to do this.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:13.860]   And we weren't.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.180]   Imagine the pressure you would feel that you have to own such that it would hurt your relationships
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.780]   with people that are able to do this thing.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:24.980]   And then there's one other anecdote that was so strange was a friend of mine said, gosh,
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.220]   it's getting so expensive in the Bay Area to buy a home.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.180]   I think we're going to buy a home somewhere else.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.300]   And I was like, are you moving?
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:36.020]   They're like, no, but like they had so much pressure that they felt like to be successful,
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.100]   they needed to own a home that they bought a home in a city they didn't even live in,
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.260]   not because they wanted to become rental property landlord like they didn't.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.460]   That wasn't why they just felt like they needed to own a home to be successful.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.820]   And like that was the path they were going on.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.540]   Another friend of ours in the Bay Area was like, well, we can't afford a home.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.380]   So we're going to buy a vacation home in Tahoe.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:01.060]   And I was like, if you can't afford to buy a primary home,
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.140]   I don't know if vacation home is the best option.
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.980]   I'm not saying it's a terrible like we're not going to go down that conversation.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.260]   That could be a whole nother episode.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:13.300]   But it was just there have been multiple touch points in my life where I've watched other people
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.420]   make decisions because they felt this immense pressure.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:21.780]   And in a way, the fact that interest rates are so high right now
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:27.220]   has forced the conversation to be like, maybe it's actually not a good deal.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.260]   And I just hope that we don't have this thing happen,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.700]   which I think it could go one of two ways.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.780]   One, interest rates drop and people are like, I don't even need to do the math anymore.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.140]   It must be such a good deal.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:42.660]   But the other is, oh, wow, I remember that I did the math a year ago and it didn't,
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.860]   you know, it didn't check out.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.940]   Maybe I should do it again and see if it checks out now.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.780]   Who knows?
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:53.460]   I think right now the homes are, in my opinion, homes are so expensive,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.500]   not just because the real estate market is doing great.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.580]   But I just think no one wants to sell because most people that own a home, if they sell.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.580]   What is it, like 70% of people have a sub 3% or something insane?
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.780]   Yeah, it's a massive number of people have very cheap mortgages.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.740]   And so if I wanted to move right now, I would have to go get a 7% mortgage.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.740]   And I'm like, or start renting.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.180]   And one thing that I think they do in other countries,
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:23.380]   I'd have to fact check this, but I'm pretty sure in like Germany, for example,
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.900]   you can actually take a mortgage with you.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:33.940]   So you could say, you know, I already have this loan for $400,000 that I've been paying down.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.260]   Right.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.740]   And it's at a 3% interest rate.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:42.580]   I'm going to sell this house and apply this loan to the new house that I'm going to buy.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.140]   I think that would actually clear up quite a bit of the gridlock that we have right now
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.420]   in the market where to your point, no one wants to move.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.620]   And rightfully so people feel trapped.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:58.420]   They feel like, well, I can't move because not only is it like an emotional
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.500]   thing or even not even emotional, not even is it a rational thing of,
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.540]   well, I have a 3% rate right now and I don't want a 7% rate.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.940]   It's like, no, if I had to buy a different house,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.820]   I actually would spend more money to get less.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.140]   I wouldn't even be able to afford a house as nice as the one I live in now.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.980]   If I sold it and then.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.300]   Our house would cost like 75% more if we refinanced at today's rate.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:21.780]   Right.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.740]   So what are you going to do?
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.900]   Sell that house and then go try to buy something that's 75% less nice.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.580]   Like it just doesn't make sense.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.740]   But I think if you give people the ability to.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:36.980]   Take that those loan terms with them and just shift it around,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.660]   then you might see more fluidity and like things will start to kind of like,
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.700]   you know, shift.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.500]   I don't see a way out of this beyond either more supply or like.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.420]   Some crazy unexpected externality like the.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.940]   The commission thing like another similar, you know.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:02.420]   Piece of legislation or or something that's going to shift things system wide.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.860]   So my worry is that.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.500]   I don't see the incentive.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.140]   For financial institutions to make that happen.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.140]   Now I could see it when interest rates drop.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:19.220]   You get offered a do you want a 4% interest or do you want a four and a half percent interest
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.340]   loan that you can take with you?
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.700]   My guess is they might charge a premium for something like that.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.820]   And right now I don't think you can get away with a premium because
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.700]   everyone's mind right now is I'm going to refinance in the future.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.700]   So whatever mortgage I get now, I don't care about.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.780]   But if we get to a point where people have this recent kind of past of wow,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   they used to be it was 7% three years ago.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.300]   Do I want four?
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.380]   Do I want four and a half that's portable?
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.660]   Maybe that could be a cool product.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.620]   I'm trying to pull up the exact numbers here, but.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.300]   Right now we're in our Picasso, which is like a fractional home.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.700]   We only own one eighth of this house.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.660]   And I was talking to a friend who was going through the process of
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.140]   buying an eighth of a house in Southern California.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.740]   And the owners when you're selling a home.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.660]   Right now it's typical that the only thing you really negotiate is the price.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.220]   And but people's mindsets are just different on different factors.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.380]   And one of the best pieces of advice I think my might have been my brother-in-law gave me
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.540]   figure out what matters to the seller.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:15.940]   Yep.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.980]   And some people really want to get the deal done fast.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.020]   And so if you can promise a short close, you can get something done.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.860]   Some people want a great family to live in the house that they raise their kids in.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   And that letter is going to move the needle.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.260]   I can tell you the letter is probably not going to move the needle for me.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.340]   But like for some people, the letter matters.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.260]   For some people, it's the best price.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:43.060]   But Picasso gave owners who were selling the ability to buy down the interest rate for the
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.940]   buyers.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   So I can't remember exactly how it worked, but it was like for an amount of money that
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:53.780]   wasn't as much as you'd think, you could give the potential buyer of this property like
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.180]   a 2% mortgage for the next 10 years.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.780]   It was a fixed 10-year interest-only mortgage.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:05.300]   But the seller could basically spend like, I don't know, $10,000 to buy the interest
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.500]   rate down to 1.99%.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.220]   I'm not going to quote every dollar amount I just said could be wrong.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:16.420]   But there is an amount that when I heard the number didn't seem that high that you could
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:22.020]   pay to basically be able to market your house as this house has a 2% interest rate for the
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.820]   next 10 years.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:28.740]   So let's say this house was $750,000, what's more compelling?
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:37.540]   Like a $750,000 house with a 7% interest or like a $760,000 house with a 2% interest?
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.820]   Like people are irrational.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.060]   And the answer is it was exactly the same.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.820]   Like if you did the math and you said, "Oh, what if I take $10,000 and I just put it in
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.940]   a high-interest savings account and I use it to make the extra payment?"
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.700]   The math was even.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   But some people just loved the idea of locking in 2% for 10 years, right?
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.820]   Like it just sounded so good.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:04.100]   So I wonder if kind of in the way that points were a thing, I wonder if instead of me, the
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:09.940]   buyer having to do that, I wonder if the seller might want to market that property in a way
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.620]   that it could change the dynamics.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.020]   I don't know.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.820]   It was just the most interesting thing that I've seen happen in interest rates where the
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.820]   seller could choose to buy down the interest rate.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:24.740]   Well, there's a piece of this that I'm also now thinking about, which is you said, "Think
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.820]   about what matters to the seller."
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.460]   And this won't be the case for everybody, but I did have this woman named Catherine
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.660]   Valentine on my show a couple of months ago.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:41.860]   She's a negotiation expert and she told this story about buying her current home.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:48.020]   And what they found was that she basically is looking through this house that she's in
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.660]   love with, right?
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:56.580]   And as is common, she goes, "Well, this is kind of like the tippy, tippy, tippy top of
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.780]   our affordability range.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.220]   Like technically we would need this to be like 10 to 20% less for it to be like comfortably
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.220]   affordable, as is the experience with most people nowadays.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.500]   Like you're probably stretching yourself to get into that house."
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.060]   But she said that she noticed something when she was kind of examining the home.
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.140]   She's like, "This place is immaculate.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.660]   It's pristine."
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.940]   The wife of this couple that lived in this house thought of everything when they were
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.660]   renovating it.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.780]   You know, they have under cabinet, you know, inside the cabinet, what is it called?
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:35.140]   Outlets, like every, like down to the inch of every tiny little detail has been accounted
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:35.380]   for.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:41.540]   And she was like, "Something tells me based on this couple and what I am noticing about
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.460]   this home, that money is not the most important thing to these people.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.780]   Like making the most money possible on this sale is not what they care about."
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:57.780]   And so when they went in to make their offer, she structured multiple, I think the strategy
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:02.580]   is called multiple equivalent simultaneous offers, such that you are pulling different
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.940]   levers in each one so that to you, it's kind of all the same.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.140]   You'd be happy with anything, but you're basically giving this person options.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.780]   And so in one of these offers, they basically said, you know, "We'll close as fast as
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.500]   you want.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.340]   We'll waive the inspection," which she said would typically never do that, but it was
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.380]   a calculated risk based on how pristinely this home had been maintained that like pretty
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.140]   sure we're not going to find any issues here.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:31.460]   And you know, basically like anything you don't want, just leave it behind.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.460]   That chandelier you hate, don't worry about it.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:33.860]   Leave it.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.660]   That room of stuff that you would have to figure out something to do, don't worry, just
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:36.900]   leave it.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.180]   We'll figure it out.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.980]   And they ended up giving them quite a good discount on the home and chose that offer
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.420]   because they wanted to move fast.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.780]   They didn't want to have to worry about hiring people to come in and clean out the crap.
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:53.860]   So she said, in much the same way you just explained, like, "I just want to echo paying
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.540]   attention to what the seller really cares about and where you might be able to structure
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:05.380]   a deal or, you know, negotiate in a way that if you, if you're aware of their core interests,
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.460]   a lot of people's core interest actually isn't money.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.740]   Some people have a ton of money and more money than they know what to do with.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.780]   And like, they're actually more concerned with timing, ease, convenience, these things
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:20.500]   that as the buyer, you might actually be more able to give them those things than all the
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.620]   money they could ever want.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.940]   It's not going to work every time, but in certain transactions, it's kind of an interesting
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.060]   way to approach it.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.100]   It's funny, as you're saying that, I have two reactions.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.860]   One is I've never actually considered doing the multiple offer thing, right?
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.460]   Like some people might want the certainty that you're not going to flake out.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.900]   So you could have a really high deposit.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.700]   Say we're going to give you 5% and if we back out, you can keep the house or you can
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.100]   keep the 5%.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.300]   Like another one is like, we'll close faster.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.900]   But on the other side of the equation, if someone came to me and said, "I have one
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.660]   offer at one price where I'm willing to give you 5% and I have one offer at another
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.260]   price where I'm willing to close fast.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.140]   And then I have this other one where I'm going to keep all my contingencies and keep
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.820]   everything, but I'll pay a little bit more."
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.180]   My immediate reaction would be, "Well, I know you can afford the high price and I
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.420]   know you can afford the 5% deposit."
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:13.220]   So I would counter with like the combination of like the most value, the best offer for
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:13.940]   all of them.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.260]   And you'd have to be able to stand your ground because you've just shown your cards that
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.940]   you can afford the high price.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.380]   I don't know, to be fair.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.500]   I don't know that any of her offers included the full price.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:31.060]   I think she was just betting on the fact that like, "I'm making some assumptions about
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.940]   these people I'm buying this house from, that like they actually don't care as much
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.540]   about getting top dollar."
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.060]   Oh, another indication.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.620]   It was also that they had already bought their next home.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:46.020]   They hadn't sold the current home yet, had already purchased the next one.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:51.300]   So she's like, "Oh, so they don't even need this money to like buy the next house
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.340]   they're going to live in.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:52.820]   All right.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.820]   I've got wiggle room here.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:58.980]   I don't have to throw all the money I possibly can at these people because that's probably
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.060]   not actually going to move the needle as much."
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.540]   So I would say one thing here is try to figure out as much as you can about the seller before
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.100]   you buy.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.900]   Put those internet stalking skills to work.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:14.740]   I mean, property records are usually something you can search up online by address.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.940]   Um, you know, we, one of our partners has always delete me.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.980]   Most people haven't gone and removed their personal information from the web.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   So to the extent they don't listen to this show, their information is probably out there.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.540]   Uh, do your research and try to figure out who these people are.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.020]   But I like the idea of even saying, "Hey, I'm going to submit an offer.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.700]   Here are three types of offers.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.220]   Which one do you want?"
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.380]   And then just asking that question or even asking their agent, be like, "Would you rather
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.700]   have the high, the high deposit?
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.300]   Would you rather have the faster close?
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.820]   What kind of offer do you want?"
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.940]   Um, that's interesting.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.980]   Now, now we're going down this path of how to, how to make sure you buy a house after
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.940]   we just spent all this time talking about how it's not the best deal.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:56.980]   I mean, most people probably are eventually going to do it, but I think it's the life
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.340]   cycle of it is funny too.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:03.620]   Because like in my, in our age group, you know, the circles that I'm having this conversation
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.500]   and it's kind of like my forever home, but then I go and visit my grandma who just sold
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.580]   her house and is now moving back into a place that she has to rent because she can't take
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.260]   care of a house anymore.
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.620]   And it also just kind of makes me think about the cyclicality of all of this.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:23.380]   That like, yeah, just also keep in mind that like that forever home isn't actually in most
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.580]   cases forever.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:28.180]   Like most people will eventually become renters again.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:34.420]   So it's the function of like, do you along the way want to be a property owner?
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.060]   Do you want, is it the expectation or assumption that like being the property owner is going
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.700]   to give you more money later when you go to potentially move into like some sort of assisted
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:50.980]   living or not that that's everyone's path, but like generally speaking, there is a, you
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.900]   end up coming kind of full circle again, in many cases, if you live long enough, that
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.220]   is.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:48:00.740]   It would have been even cheaper to get a 10 year, a 10 year fixed rate and that adjusted
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.540]   after, right?
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.500]   Like an interest, an adjustable rate for 10 years.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.420]   So I thought, hmm, should we do this?
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.740]   And I asked around, if you look online, the average person stays in their home 12 or 13
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:10.980]   years.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:17.300]   And when you look at a 10 year adjustable rate mortgage, the breakeven point is somewhere,
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.060]   depending on the rate and the cost somewhere around like 13 or 14 years.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:26.660]   Meaning if the 10% adjustable rate is less of an interest rate, which it almost always
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:31.140]   would be than a 30 year fixed year 11, you're paying more than you would for the 30 year.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.540]   But like you saved so much for 10 years that it kind of breaks even around 13 years.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.260]   And I was like, gosh, if the average person leaves in the window of time that the adjustable
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.540]   rate is actually a better deal, what do I want to do?
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.380]   And it's even though I was like, well, on average, I would guess I'm probably the kind
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.700]   of person that would move more than the average person.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.860]   Yet somehow I couldn't bring myself to do it.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.580]   So like we...
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:57.620]   Why do you think that it's just the certainty of feeling like on the off chance we want
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.180]   to stay longer, I'm going to be kicking myself?
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.340]   Or I mean, it could have been too that you looked at just historical interest rates and
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.620]   said, we're at an all time low.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.260]   I mean, how much...
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.040]   I think it's...
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.780]   I'll say probably the latter is what I said.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.860]   But you said one of the greatest reasons of buying is that you like lock in this price.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.060]   It was kind of like, I don't like uncertainty.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:24.180]   And so I'm willing to pay a premium for uncertainty going away.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.740]   And there's just no stress about it.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:26.980]   Right?
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.660]   I know that if I had this 10 year mortgage, I have friends that did this.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.940]   They have right now an adjustable rate mortgage and they still have a few years.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.700]   But right now they're like, gosh, in a few years, like, what are we going to have to
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:39.860]   pay?
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.420]   What are we going to...
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.460]   Oh, how is this going to work?
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.500]   What are we going to do?
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.660]   And I just don't need that in my life.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.860]   Like, I don't have to think about it if that happens.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:54.820]   I'm also seeing a lot of articles right now about how I assume it's because property tax
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:50:01.220]   assessed values are going up, that this is happening, but that people's property tax
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.140]   bills and insurance rates are going through the roof right now.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:10.100]   And so I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, like over the weekend, where there are all
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:16.820]   these instances of people getting new quotes and they're like, oh my God, I'm on a fixed
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.300]   income.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.260]   Like I'm 67 years old living on social security.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:25.140]   I can't afford $400 more a month for my insurance and taxes.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.220]   Like, this isn't what I signed up for.
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.940]   I think the examples given were in like Boulder, Colorado.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:33.700]   They probably weren't in California because with Prop 13, your property tax only goes
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.620]   up by like a small percentage each year.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.500]   That's good.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.900]   And it's kind of inflation adjusted even.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.820]   But in a lot of other states, your property tax changes every year.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.700]   And so...
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:48.020]   But one thing that I've talked about before, but if anyone wasn't listening, you can appeal
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:48.900]   your property tax.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:54.420]   Even in California, because we bought only in the last few years, in the middle of the
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:59.300]   pandemic, you could make a strong case that our home has gone down in value since we bought
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.020]   it, at least based on comps.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.220]   I think you could make that case.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.620]   And so we appealed our property tax.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.540]   And unfortunately, the process takes like nine months.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.420]   Do you have to go in actually and present your case?
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.460]   That's what would happen.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:18.740]   However, once there's a date, then the assessor reaches out and says, hey, can we work out
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.100]   a deal? It's almost like a settlement where they're like, hey, can we come up with something?
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:22.980]   A little plea deal.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.540]   I sent off all my data, my spreadsheets.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.500]   I said, here's why I think the property's gone down by 15%.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.860]   Oh God, they didn't see you coming.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.940]   And then they're going to come back and say, what if we go down 10%?
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.700]   What if we go down 13%?
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.980]   And I don't know how it'll work.
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.020]   I can't wait to share more.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.620]   But once we do it, we lock it in for forever.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.300]   But if you live in Texas, you might have to do it every single year.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.340]   But there are some advantages.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.980]   I believe it is Texas where there isn't all this public data.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:58.340]   So you actually have a lot more control over how much your house is worth because there
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.340]   just aren't public records of all the sales.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.460]   I believe this is Texas.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.260]   I could be wrong.
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.980]   Whereas in California, you can go look up any property and be like, how much did it
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.780]   sell for?
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.580]   What were the prices?
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.700]   What are the comps?
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.620]   And in some states, that stuff isn't all just open public data.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.420]   And so you can kind of say, my house is worth this much.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.460]   And it's on the state to be able to prove that you're wrong.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.820]   Oh, like the burden of proof is on them.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.580]   I believe that's the case in California.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.020]   I was talking with the founder of this company, OwnWell, that will do this for you.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.780]   So if you're not a nerd like me that wants to go spend millions of hours building a model
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:32.580]   to save like $500, which most people probably aren't, you can hire them.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.180]   And they'll go negotiate on your behalf.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.100]   They'll file all the paperwork on your behalf to the state or the county.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:44.020]   And then they'll take 25% of whatever they save you in the first year.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.380]   So in California, it's a great deal, right?
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.780]   If they save you $1,000 a year for life, you pay them $250.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.460]   It used to be a very old school business model.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:55.300]   We got a letter in the mail from some company that was like, hey, we're going to negotiate
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.100]   this for you.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.900]   And then I was like, this company seems like an old school.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.420]   There's got to be a better version of this.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.980]   And I looked online and I was like, oh, there's like the startup version that's gone through
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.620]   and crunched all the data to do it more efficiently.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.140]   And they don't charge as high a fee.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.980]   And it seems like they do a better job.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.100]   So in hindsight, I should have just used them.
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.420]   But I love going down the rabbit hole of seeing how it all works.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.380]   I actually reached out to them and they were like, why don't we just show you how it works?
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.420]   You can file it yourself.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.300]   And they kind of peeled back the curtain and showed me all the models they would build.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:29.540]   And then they put a deal on the deals page on all the hacks.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.340]   They gave everyone a deal.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.220]   So there is that.
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.460]   If you're an owner, you can negotiate that.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:36.100]   But if you're a renter, you don't have to deal with any of this.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.220]   None of these extra fees.
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.140]   So and funny enough, we were talking about a handful of people we know, mutual friends
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:45.540]   of ours who have more money than both of us combined, I think almost all of them.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.740]   And they're all renters.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.780]   Like we have a ton of friends with money who are all renting.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:53.860]   And so this is not, you know, you said, oh, correlates, right?
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.860]   People with more money are more likely to be owners.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:00.980]   But people that we know who are really savvy with money, who have lots of money,
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.980]   still appreciate the flexibility.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.500]   I want to move.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.620]   I want to do whatever I want.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:10.500]   I, my wife and I are always talking about, oh, wouldn't it be fun to go like move to
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.300]   Japan for a year?
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.700]   Wouldn't it be fun to go live in Spain for a year?
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:14.980]   I'm like, oh, we have this house.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:19.380]   I mean, this low interest rate, like it almost doesn't even seem possible.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.580]   Like you could lease it out.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.780]   Totally.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.060]   But I'm just, it almost like feels like it's an obstacle.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:29.060]   It's like something in the way that otherwise you could just be like, whatever, screw it.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:29.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.580]   And maybe the grass is always greener, but there's some world where it's like, gosh.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:38.020]   It would kind of be nice if we were renting and someone was like, hey, at the end of the
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.380]   year, we're going to need our house back.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.340]   And we were like, sweet.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.420]   We were just forced to have to decide what we want to do and where we want to go and
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.220]   where we want to live.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.460]   And like, all those things are on the table.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:53.540]   Whereas right now, the amount of work it would take to even consider moving is so drastically
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:53.860]   high.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.580]   Now, obviously I'm a hundred percent sure that if someone is listening to this and they're
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.140]   like, my landlord is telling me that at the end of the year, I have to move.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.540]   They're not like stoked about that decision.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:08.340]   And I sympathize with that person greatly because that's a horrible situation to be
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:08.660]   in.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:13.220]   No one wants to not know where they're going to go, but I think I don't have the freedom
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.500]   that someone who rents does.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.060]   Yeah, totally.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:21.380]   And I'm not sure I would trade for it right now, but I definitely am jealous of it a bit.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:30.260]   I also think that when you're young and you're not quite, I'll say, established yet in your
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:37.220]   career, renting has a lot of upside because you want that type of flexibility.
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:44.260]   Like if your job has an opportunity a couple States away and you're up for it, you want
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:51.140]   to be able to like jump on that and take it and, and, you know, grow with a completely
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.500]   unencumbered by like, oh, but I have this house that I have to sell.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.140]   And that's a whole nother element that I have to consider.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:02.500]   And it's like, I've always heard people kind of talk about how, when you're young, even
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.580]   if you can afford it, or you could technically afford it, that sometimes there's a benefit
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:11.060]   to continuing to rent because it just means that you have more flexibility, not just in
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:17.540]   what you want to do and like discretionary moves, but that if your career were to kind
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.540]   of, you know, go in a different direction that you could quickly jump on that and be
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.020]   nimble in the choices that you're making.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:24.820]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:31.300]   I don't know what made me think of this, but another hidden cost of owning that I believe
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:36.900]   Ramit Sethi brought up in a podcast I heard him on was when you buy a home, you spend
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:37.940]   way more on furniture.
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:43.780]   When you rent a home, you have this budget, not think of not furnishings and renovations,
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.100]   not as like major things that have problems.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:49.380]   Like obviously when you rent and the toilet breaks, that's on the landlord.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.220]   When you own, it's not on the landlord.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.140]   It's on you like paying a plumber or learning how to become a plumber overnight.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:59.220]   And, and, and I was thinking, gosh, when you buy, you're like, oh, I'm going to be here
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:56:59.780]   forever.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   We deserve like a really nice bed.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:02.340]   Look at the kitchen.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.020]   Like we should redo the kitchen.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.660]   Like you never, you don't think about that when you're renting because why would we redo
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.140]   the kitchen?
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.180]   Like it's not our kitchen.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.820]   But we didn't need to redo that.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.420]   You know, we redid our laundry room.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.820]   We didn't need to redo the laundry room.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.940]   I feel a lot better.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.780]   I love the new laundry room we have.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.540]   It looks like it was the only room in our house that hadn't been renovated was one bathroom
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.340]   and one laundry room.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.580]   So we had this house where even though it's about a hundred years old, every room had
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:28.580]   been updated in the last a hundred years.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:34.020]   And then the bathroom, it had been updated maybe 30, 40 years ago, but it just looks
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:38.740]   so weirdly out of place with these like Italian tiles that are like, I can't even describe
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.780]   it, but it was the one room missing.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.500]   The Tuscan mom kitchen that everyone knows about.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.780]   We had the Tuscan mom bathroom.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.980]   Yeah, the Tuscan mom bathroom.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.220]   There's like the olive oil on the, on the counter with the little peppers inside it
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.740]   or whatever the hell that weird decor was back in the like mid aughts.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.060]   Yeah, so we renovated that, but we wouldn't have done it if we were renting.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:57.560]   Totally.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.580]   And but your point about furniture is well taken.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.620]   I mean, like you definitely, I always say that too.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.060]   Weirdly enough, like I'm aware of this.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:08.820]   I always go, eh, you know, we'll get nice furniture when we buy.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.980]   I'm not going to pay a bunch of money to on like nice furniture to furnish a house.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:16.020]   I'm like, I don't know if this is the layout that we're always going to have or if we're
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.100]   always like, why would I buy this sectional when I don't know if our like family room
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.340]   in the house we're going to buy is going to be this shape.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.460]   Like it might not fit.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.180]   It might not work.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.940]   So you kind of yeah, you like defer those types of upgrades.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.300]   But as anyone who has ever spent a lot of money on furniture knows.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.220]   You really don't.
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.540]   It doesn't really change your life like at all.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:39.700]   We've we've spent a little bit of money on like one or two nice pieces.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:44.260]   And beyond the first week or two, I didn't think about it again.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.460]   Yeah, maybe a mattress.
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:46.500]   I've not heard anyone.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.940]   Oh, I do have a nice mattress.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.060]   Like that seems to be one, but that seems to be one that's like a functional choice.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.820]   That's not like an aesthetic decision.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:56.340]   No, it's like and it's very easy because you're going to have a mattress in your next house.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.060]   It's probably going to fit.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.620]   This is what determines the quality of my sleep.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:05.620]   Like that is a different decision than like, oh, is this a, you know, a $400 couch I bought
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.700]   off a friend, which is what our current couch is?
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:12.580]   Or are we spending $5,000 on this sectional because it's in our forever home?
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.020]   And it just I think, yeah, the stakes of the decisions feel much higher.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:20.660]   So that framing that as a hidden cost is interesting because it's it's not that you
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:24.900]   would have to do that if you buy, but just psychologically, you're more oriented in that
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.380]   direction as an owner, which I think is interesting.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.380]   Yeah, we really struggle because we look at these furniture stores like room and board
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.180]   design within reach.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.700]   You know, this is within reach.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.580]   Yeah, really.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:38.420]   And we're like, I just can't I don't need a $2,000 coffee table.
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:42.260]   So we don't have a lot of really nice furniture.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:49.300]   But we keep telling ourselves one day we'll one day we'll graduate and buy really nice
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.340]   furniture for now.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.060]   Like, I think, you know, there's some great stuff on Wayfair.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:59.860]   But yeah, OK, I feel like we probably belabor this topic a lot.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:06.900]   My takeaway is just do the math like and and we didn't talk much about the emotional side
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.780]   of it, which is like a really big, important part.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.540]   Some arguably the biggest part.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.300]   Yeah, some people like this one.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.660]   Some people want to buy a home because they just feel like they want to own a home.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.180]   And that's fine.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:24.580]   My only thing with that, though, I would just encourage you to interrogate that desire and
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.940]   where that is coming from.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.700]   I think in some cases it can be very genuinely held.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:35.220]   And then in other cases, if something has been marketed to you your entire life, it
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.860]   probably feels like a very genuine desire.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.540]   But like, what is it about ownership that is so appealing to you?
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.740]   Like, because your name is going to be on the deed and not the lease.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.380]   Like, what's really what's the difference?
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.340]   Why? Why is that?
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:53.140]   And you might have an amazing answer and you might be in a place that you can afford it.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.180]   Fantastic.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:00.340]   But I do think that, like, it's one of those things in life where everyone kind of feels
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.860]   like they want to buy a home because we've all been told our entire lives that it's the
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.220]   American dream.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.340]   And like, there is so much money that gets spent every year on like marketing the dream
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:14.660]   of homeownership to Americans is like how you'll know you've made it and like what it
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.020]   means to be an adult.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.100]   So, yeah, if that's the water you're swimming in, you probably are going to feel pretty
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.860]   emotionally driven toward the choice.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.500]   But I do think it's worth kind of taking a second look like, well, what is it really
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.300]   about this that I'm I'm so drawn to?
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.580]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.660]   It just kind of feels like that's when I know I've made.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:36.900]   OK, well, it's probably just like you've really internalized the marketing that's been, you
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:42.660]   know, crammed down your throat your entire life, as opposed to like, oh, well, I need
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.180]   the land and I like to garden and I like little projects and I have these dogs and I want
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:46.740]   my kids to.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.540]   It's like those reasons to me.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.420]   I'm like, sure.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.500]   Like, yeah, you're into projects.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.580]   You like to work on stuff like door with your hands.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.380]   You want a yard.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.860]   You want to live with animals, kids.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.060]   You want to live in a specific place.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.300]   It's like it's like a continuity of stability thing.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:05.940]   Maybe maybe you didn't grow up in a home like you were always moving apartments with your
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.340]   family.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.540]   And so like you want to have more stability in your own life.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.020]   Perfect.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:14.740]   But like as long as the answer goes deeper than like, I don't know, I just kind of feel
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.220]   like I should and I don't know why I feel like I should.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:22.180]   That's that answer is where I'm like, you might want to think about that a little bit
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:22.660]   more.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:26.980]   Yeah, I imagine if you push on that and run the numbers, you might be able to convince
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.940]   yourself differently.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.620]   Or if you have a lot of pressure from a family member, maybe run their numbers, go back,
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:36.580]   go back and see, like, because I think it's crazy if you look at, you know, what the rule
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.380]   72, right?
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.580]   So you divide 72 by the interest rate or the return.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.100]   Take stock market at 7%.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.620]   It's like 10 years to double your money.
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.820]   So if your parents have owned a house for 30 years and they're like our home doubled,
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.700]   actually, that's not good.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.180]   Like that was a bad return.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:59.220]   And so I would just say, make sure that if you're guiding a lot of your emotion on data,
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.300]   make sure you actually look at that data checks out because I don't know, I'd say if your
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.540]   home hasn't tripled in three years, in 30 years, like you probably didn't get a good
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:07.940]   return.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.540]   So.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.500]   So true.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.940]   Okay, this is fun.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.380]   Thank you for driving down here.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.660]   Dude, thanks for having me.
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.860]   This was so fun.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.220]   And for everyone listening, I would say this is slightly a different episode.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.860]   It was like not as prepared in terms of like we outlined every bullet point we wanted.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.220]   It was more of a raw conversation.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.140]   Which I know we were both big preparers.
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:27.860]   We're both big.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.900]   I'm a scripter.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:33.140]   I'm like every single word that I'm going to say into this microphone has been fine
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.380]   tuned by three editors first.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.460]   So yes, the off the cuff thing was fun.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.380]   So I'm curious if people have feedback.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.140]   Podcast at all the hacks dot com.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.100]   Thanks for being here.
