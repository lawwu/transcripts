[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340]   What are some other big mistakes you see when people come to you what they're doing in writing?
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.160]   Too long. There's like the shortification of everything, right? It used to be we watched
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.740]   movies, then we watched TV shows that are 30 minutes. And now we watch YouTube videos that
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.660]   are 10 minutes. And now we watch YouTube shorts that are 30 seconds long, right? And contrary to
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.540]   what most people say, they're like, we don't have the attention span. It's like if you took TikTok
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.240]   to someone in the 1800s, they would still watch it, right? It's not the human attention span that
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.300]   got shorter. It's just that we are better at telling stories quicker. I don't need 400 pages
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.580]   to explain to you how to cook an egg. I could probably do it in 20 seconds. Similarly,
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.500]   I think some people take way too long to get to the damn point. Even like an Instagram post,
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960]   it's like a picture and like a paragraph of text is about as much as you need to explain a lot of
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.480]   different concepts. So the shortification of everything, can you say all of this stuff in
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.520]   one page or even one paragraph rather than 10? That's so much better.
