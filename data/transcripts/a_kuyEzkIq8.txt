[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Let's start get back to basics a little bit do a habit tune up.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   So this is where I go and I take a particular strategy or tactic relevant to living a deeper
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.860]   more productive life and we we get into the weeds.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.900]   This one is based off of my recent experience of coming back from a long vacation and that
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.000]   dreaded first weekday back after vacation where you you you face everything that has
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   piled up you go through your inboxes you confront your calendar again you go to your long neglected
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.720]   quarterly plans and you realize okay I'm completely overwhelmed how am I ever going to get my
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.680]   arms around this it's never my favorite thing but I went through it but as I was going through
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.200]   this the Monday after I got back from my vacation it got me thinking about a bigger effect that
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.700]   I wanted to discuss.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.520]   So here's the phenomenon that I think is common you have a big let's call it task list right
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.880]   you you go through your calendars your inbox you have all these various things you're writing
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   out that need to get done you're looking at this list of all this wide variety of different
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:14.720]   types of things and you freeze it just seems impossible to even get started it's not that
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.760]   any one particular task is impossible to do or incredibly daunting it's just somehow seeing
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.240]   the combination of them seems to mentally speaking freeze you in place and it's very
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.360]   difficult to make progress you go online and you have to check baseball trade rumors and
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.280]   you go back and check your inbox again and you look at social media and you do anything
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.840]   you can but try to tackle this list something about something about it freezes you.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.080]   So let me give you an example so we're going for those who are watching this on YouTube
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.520]   youtube.com/calendarportmedia I'm bringing up on the screen now a sample list let me
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.840]   scroll this slightly all right so if you're looking if you're looking at this on YouTube
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.400]   on the left here I have a list of just the types of things you would drop onto a list
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.960]   as you're trying to catch up after vacation so for those listing I have on here transfer
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.720]   money next step on dinner party new copy for Karen budget reply to Jennifer reply to mom
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.920]   add reminder to calendar for bill laundry notes to Alex order new cable update Amazon
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.040]   bio writing plan for rest of week a lot of these actually by the way came from my processing
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   of everything not so long ago so when you face a task list like this it's common to
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.840]   freeze you feel significant resistance to action now what's actually going on here is
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.960]   there's a there's a neuroscientific explanation for this freezing if you get into the details
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.920]   of how the human brain actually plans and then motivates you to do non-simple physical
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.280]   action it gets pretty complicated but there's a whole what we call there's a sort of a
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.720]   plan execute reward loop where if there's something you want to do you set this target
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.360]   of what you're trying to accomplish this loop then accesses the hippocampus so it can
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.960]   look at memories and pull up memories of you executing this thing in the past so that you
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.480]   can simulate different plans and find one that works then there's a very complicated
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.520]   connection from here to the ventral striatum is a sort of complicated uniquely human part
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.480]   of the brain that's very involved in motivation for non-simple physical activity so I have
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.660]   to get up and get started working on the budget so it's not a simple physical activity such
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.080]   as I need to reach over here to grab this apple but something more abstract and complicated
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.160]   they all work together the motivation is generated and you start working when you see a list
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.320]   that's this long and this diverse so it's many different things and they are semantically
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   unrelated what's involved in getting new copy to Karen is very different than what's involved
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.520]   in working on your household budget that apparatus can't function that apparatus is meant for
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.200]   this is the thing you want to do let's make a plan here's your motivation go and do it
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.520]   now you're done here's a dopamine yay it can't handle the idea of these 10 or 15 different
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.000]   things that all have to be done because it can't literally have the bandwidth to try
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.160]   to make a plan to envision a plan to pull out memories from your hippocampus and simulate
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.440]   your plan for 15 things at once so that feeling of task freeze that feeling of task freeze
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.240]   that we see when we have a long and diverse list is actually the neuroscientific correlate
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.480]   of our planning apparatus freezing itself it can't deal with it so it doesn't generate
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.680]   the needed motivation so this way of work and organization that's so common in modern
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.880]   life where we have a lot of very varied things that have to be done all mixed together all
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   at once really is incompatible with our brain so I was facing the same thing I had a list
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.440]   like this longer but actually a lot of these things are from that list so what do you do
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.840]   here well if you understand if you understand what's happening in your brain you can work
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.800]   with that and what I do what I did the other day what I commonly do in these situations
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:13.560]   is I will begin sorting these lists and combining like tasks tasks that are a similar type of
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.360]   behavior using a similar part of your brain and I will sort them into standalone groups
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.160]   or piles so if you look on the screen here so again if you're watching if you're watching
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.040]   on YouTube you'll see I have one group where I have reply to Jennifer reply to mom next
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.880]   step dinner party and I've elaborated that task to say email restaurant because that's
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.760]   actually what the next step is I have to email the person at the restaurant those three things
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.280]   are together why because it's all the same type of thing I'm in email I'm composing messages
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.760]   to people that's a group then I have a separate group below that where I put add calendar
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:57.040]   reminder order new cable update calendar I should say update Amazon bio and start laundry
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.600]   by the way a lot of those are actually real Jesse so the new cable is I ordered an Ethernet
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   cable for the HQ because we were having some connection issues with the NPR recording so
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.120]   I'm just going to hardwire this be straight to the straight to the modem update the bio
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.800]   my agent wrote me it was like you realize your bio on Amazon your author bio was written
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.120]   right when so good they can't ignore you came out in 2012 so it's a little bit out of date
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.760]   so these are actually real things but why are those four things together in this group
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.080]   because in my mind those are all what I would think of as small non-demanding task I have
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.000]   to add something on the calendar I could jump over to Amazon and order something I have
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.720]   to copy this bio for my website and log in so it's it's online minor semi-tedious but
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:48.440]   requires very little thinking type tasks next group notes for Alex notes for Karen now I
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.160]   put these together because these are things that are going to require time and non-trivial
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.680]   thinking these both actually came from my real list the other day notes for Alex Alex
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.800]   is my my doctoral student it's notes I owed him on his doctoral dissertation proposal
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.840]   Karen Karen is actually the the web designer and consultant that keeps Cal Newport calm
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.320]   up and running we're doing a revamp at Cal Newport calm and actually order some notes
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.080]   on the latest design so those are things that require thinking I got to sit down I got to
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.360]   load up a non-trivial cognitive context I have to give it non-trivial thought I put
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   those together and finally I have budget transfer money writing plan in its own group budget
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.800]   transfer money these are kind of similar things you're thinking about your finances family
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.020]   finances you're in a planning type mode I felt like that was a good mode where you would
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.000]   also maybe want to work on a writing plan so I have I have grouped together like with
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.440]   like the final piece of the strategy is that you tackle one group at a time when you're
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.080]   doing that group that's what you're all in doing that group and then you step back you
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.920]   reset your rest you go get the new coffee you go for a walk then you come back and tackle
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:02.040]   another group take a break you know I'm going to go chat over here check in on whatever
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.380]   going on online then tackle another group this ends up being a much more effective way
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.000]   of getting through this work because what you will immediately notice is that when you
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.200]   are focusing on here is a group of similar tasks that I've grouped together and all I
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.040]   want to do is tackle this group your planning apparatus can deal with that oh it's email
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.600]   time all right let's get in that we can do that I get that we're going to go in here
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.560]   and send emails that we're going to be done that makes sense that's coherent here's the
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.720]   plan let's execute here's the motivation a little bit of oh you got it done when you're
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.040]   done when you group like by like your brain can get in the game and you get rid of the
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.560]   task freeze and you can actually make progress now why do you take a break between the groups
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.040]   because you have to let that cognitive context begin to dissipate so you're not stuck in
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.800]   the email context you're not stuck in the doing difficult notes to students and web
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.920]   consultant context let the context dissipate let your brain catch a breather and load up
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:02.520]   that whole planning apparatus for the next group so I think the name for this habit tune
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.800]   up I was I was used in my notes is task list are inhumane and what I meant by that is just
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.400]   staring at a task list like the one I had up on the screen on the left there where it's
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:20.200]   15 different unrelated things is literally in human in the sense that it does not match
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.960]   the way the human brain works and so we have to work with our actual cognitive apparatus
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.680]   grouping like by like tackling groups with rest in between that's the way to tackle long
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.520]   diverse task list at least that's the way I did it and it got me through catching up
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.600]   when I got back from my trip so is that test list and you're working memory dot working
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.240]   memory dot txt exactly I don't want frills I want to just type as fast as I can to a
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   text file then it's then it's so easy in a text file to copy and paste and move things
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.320]   around and just put a bunch of equal signs to put little dividers between them I love
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.200]   the simplicity of it and then also when I'm tackling individual task and I have my working
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.920]   memory dot txt plain text file open I always just have a buffer section where I can copy
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.820]   text and write text and put notes to myself just to extend my working memory and help
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.060]   me tackle the task in front of me so yeah when I'm going through a list like this and
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.720]   organizing it grouping it and executing it the number one tool that ties that all together
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.320]   is that plain text file plain text tile on my desktop is organizing extending my brain
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.560]   organizing all this work so all of this stuff I did in a text file on my desktop and then
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.920]   when you when you're on vacation you have certain things that come up you just write
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.080]   it down your moleskin right and then transfer that over when you get back to a computer
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.160]   yeah whatever capture you want to use yeah or I had a paper notebook the bigger spiral
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.480]   bound notebook but yeah you capture wherever and then you just when you need to deal with
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.000]   it transfer it all into the text file go through your calendar to see what's coming up transfer
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.600]   the relevant things to your text file go through your inboxes transfer the relevant things
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.560]   your text file just dump the whole thing you'll have task freeze this list is just completely
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.920]   freeze your mind but don't stop there sort get it into the groups and then you can actually
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.680]   you can actually start executing it's all brain hacking it's all brain hacking and it's
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.320]   it's almost miraculous how it works because it's it's a weird effects task freeze is a
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.760]   weird effect it's why can't I do the first thing in this list it's easy I have to send
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.000]   one email why can't I do it it's because your brain is looking at the whole list and says
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.280]   I can't handle that if I can't handle it I cannot get the proper whatever elements of
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   the cortex the ventral striatum operating properly and if that doesn't operate properly
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.600]   you don't get motivation you need the brain for motivation it's chemicals it's neurons
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.040]   it's not some dualistic you have your soul that that is motivated independently of your
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.360]   of your hardware as a human it all goes together so if you're getting back from vacation I
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.960]   would suggest that I'll say just my wife knows me well she said I'm clearing my schedule
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.680]   I'm clearing your schedule I I'm going to take the kids I don't have anything to do
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.340]   with you on Monday the Monday after vacation because she knows how like upset and cranky
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.520]   I get when I have to that I mean these lists get long for me when I'm away for two weeks
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.000]   there's a lot of things that build up and she's like it always stresses you out and
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.480]   it always takes you longer than you think and so like I'm taking the kids to the pool
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.800]   and I have no expectation of seeing you until the evening and she was right took all day.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.020]   [MUSIC]
