[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   I think one of the most interesting things I've learned from you in your content
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.600]   is just that you don't actually have to have $100,000 to buy $100,000 business,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.920]   which is just like kind of, I think it's probably the big unlock that no one knew.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.440]   Can you talk a little bit about or maybe give some examples of why that is true?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   Because it certainly doesn't seem it.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.680]   Yeah, it's two magic words when you don't have money. And that's seller financing,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.480]   which used to be a thing in real estate. You used to be able to sometimes buy a house
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:35.280]   and from the future profits you got off a rental unit, you could buy that house for $0 down and
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.480]   pay them over time. So the seller would finance your purchase. Now it's not so normal, but in
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.640]   buying businesses, it's very normal. 60% of all businesses are bought using essentially the seller's
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   future profits. And the reason why is because you've run a business or seven before. So how
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.240]   miserable is running a business sometimes? It's tough, right? And so for a lot of these sellers,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.040]   they've been doing this for 10, 20, 30 years, that at some point they're ready for the next thing,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.200]   even if it's a profitable business, but they're stuck in it because unlike a job,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.080]   not everybody knows how to exit a business. Everybody knows how to leave a company.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   Not a lot of people know how to sell their company. Not a lot of people know you can't
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.280]   even sell your company. And so there are a ton of sellers out there who are trapped in their
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.320]   business. Most of these sellers do not have enough cash for retirement. More than 70% of them do not
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   have a transition plan for the next generation to take over or somebody else to take over.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.120]   And so you come in as a little bit of a solution for that. And how that works really quickly,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.800]   for instance, like I always use this one deal because it was one of my smaller deals in the
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.160]   beginning. I bought a laundromat for like $100K a year that did $67,000 in profit.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160]   And that bit, so that's a one and a half, roughly X and one and a half X, the profits of the
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.080]   business is how you value these for everybody listening. And so I buy this laundromat, but I
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.120]   don't use my own cash to do it. I tell the seller over a three-year period, I'm going to pay you
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   back from the profits of the business to take over your business. And at the end of three years,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.600]   great, you have your full 100K. And at the end of the three years, I own the business outright.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.400]   And this is very common. And I would say it's not always common. You get 100%,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   but it's more common than people think. So a business costs $100,000, the business
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.760]   is making enough profit to pay for that. Why is this a good deal for the seller just to get out?
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.960]   It seems like a great deal for you because the business pays him back with the profits,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.760]   you don't spend anything. Yeah, it goes back to the old
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.560]   supply and demand curve. When you have a lot of supply and not a lot of demand,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.680]   then you're in charge. And so there's somewhere around the range of 10 to 12
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.840]   billion small businesses for sale. There's a great article actually, we did a video on it
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.760]   about Japan, and they have a crisis in business owners starting to give away their business for
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   $0. I'm not talking $0 seller financing, I'm talking $0 because the next generation doesn't
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.640]   want to run a goat herding business, or they don't want to run a plumbing business.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.880]   And so the founders of the companies just shut them down, or they try to give them away. So this
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.200]   is a real thing that happens every day. In fact, a lot of people don't think that they have a
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.680]   business, they think that they have a job. So think about your neighborhood wedding photographer,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.280]   right? Who also happens to have some contracts for high school photos that they do every year.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.720]   They do $100,000 in revenue a year. It's a great little business for them, right? That's their
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.000]   business. They do $100,000 a year. And when you take out their salary, which at this point,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.640]   they pay themselves the full amount, but let's say you take out their salary of like $60,000,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.200]   $70,000, that leaves $30,000 to $40,000 profit. That person, when they're done being a wedding
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.160]   photographer and a high school photo photographer, they probably just stop and go do something else.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   But those contracts with the high schools are worth something, that residual revenue is worth
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.280]   something, their gear is worth something, their website, the SEO that's built up, all of these
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.360]   jobs have inherent value to them. And it's just that a lot of people, there's a big mismatch.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.800]   And it's one thing we're working on trying to build right now, so I should talk to you about,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.640]   but I'm trying to build right now a better mousetrap because there's something called
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.440]   BizBuySell, which is like the Zillow or Redfin of small businesses to buy, except it's awful.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.240]   It's like bad UI/UX, a bunch of garbage on there. The financials aren't clean. They have business
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.440]   brokers that never respond to you. It's not a great site, but it's the best of all of the bad,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:50.480]   right? And so we're trying to figure out how to build a marketplace where sellers can come
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.480]   and trust that there's going to be non-looky-loo buyers on it. And we can sort of normalize the
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.040]   information and pair the two. But there's not a lot of that right now. So that wedding photographer
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.520]   can't find you, the young new photographer that would love to buy that business because you,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.840]   the young photographer, are just thinking, "Oh, I'm just going to go start my own."
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.960]   As opposed to, "What if I could buy it? What if I could instead, when I graduate dental school,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.520]   what if I could buy somebody's practice and I could give them an annuity in retirement,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.040]   but I get to start that?" Instead, people just retire.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.080]   I think buying small businesses is the next real estate. And in 10 to 20 years,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   it will be completely commoditized and normalized in a way that it is not today.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.920]   But until then, there's a lot of opportunity. If there's not a platform to do it,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.240]   is it knocking on doors? Is that how you find these businesses in your local community?
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.000]   We started one company... Well, actually, we bought a company. I bought a company called
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.040]   BizScout. BizScout.io. And that company sources off-market deals. And so basically, if you want
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.520]   to buy a car wash in your geographic area, it pulls together all the data from Yelp and Google
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.480]   and business listings and pulls them into one location. Also cross-references that with PPP
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   loans. So you can try to get to who the owner is in your location. And maybe needed some help.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.800]   And so it might be more likely to sell now. And then also pulls this list of proprietary
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.960]   deals we have from having this big audience. So BizScout.io is the one that we want to build off
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.320]   of. It's what I use right now. And then, yeah, I think the best way to buy a business is different
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.800]   than buying a house. It's almost like buying a house back in the day. Before Realtors,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.560]   you would be like, "Oh, my friend Sally is selling. You want to get into the neighborhood?
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.480]   You should talk to Sally." That's like foreign to my generation.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.120]   We can't even imagine you just buy houses on word of mouth. What's wrong with you people?
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.520]   But that is actually the best way to buy a small business is to build up your network or do what
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.400]   I call personal P&L review, where you look at all of your expenses and you see which CEOs of those
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.640]   companies you could actually get to. And you start nurturing relationships and saying, "Oh man,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.360]   you guys produced my podcast at all the hacks. How's that business going? Is it profitable?
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.440]   How long have you been doing it? A while. Cool. Is this something you want to do forever? You
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.000]   want to keep running this business? No, you don't. You're kind of ready for the next thing.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.160]   Interesting. I actually buy small businesses. If you had an offer at the right price and the
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.960]   right terms, would you be open to a conversation on potentially getting acquired or an investment
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.360]   that comes with distributing equity, cash flow, something like that? Oh, you might be interested
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.180]   So that great, now we're in the game.
