[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.840]   found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 7 and reading verses
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.720]   37 and 38. Verses 37 and 38 in the seventh chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.560]   of the Apostles. This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, "A
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.200]   prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   Him shall ye hear." This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.720]   angel which spake to him in the Mount Sinai and with our fathers who received
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:57.640]   the lively oracles to give unto us. We come back once more to this great
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.560]   speech delivered by the first Christian martyr Stephen who is to be found at
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.800]   this point on trial before the great court in Jerusalem which had the name of
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.240]   the Sanhedrin. Stephen is on trial because he is a Christian and because he
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.400]   was a preacher and a teacher of the Christian faith and an active worker as
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.920]   a deacon in the Christian Church. He's not the first Christian to be arrested.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.800]   Peter and John had already been arrested, all the Apostles had been arrested, and
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.600]   for the same reason. These people are in trouble because they're Christian,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.160]   because they say that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and that he has come
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.680]   into the world in order to redeem the world. They say that there is salvation
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.920]   in no other, that there is none other name unto heaven given amongst men
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.880]   whereby we must be saved. They say, they said this was their message, that he died
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.120]   on the cross bearing the sins of his people and that that is the only way of
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.240]   salvation. They claim that he'd risen from the dead. They preach Jesus and the
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.160]   resurrection. They said it was this resurrection, literally, physically in the
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.000]   body, that was the final proof of the fact that he was the Son of God, that he
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.440]   could even conquer death in the grave, and that he had finished the work which
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.320]   his father had given him to do even as he had claimed himself before he even
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.840]   went to the cross. This is their message, that he's the Lord of history, that he's
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.200]   going to come again and usher in the final judgment and determine the eternal
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.280]   destiny of men and women. Now Stephen is arrested and he's in trouble because of
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.600]   this. Two of the members of the Sanhedrin who you remember were the leaders of the
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.920]   Jewish people, the religious leaders as well as the political leaders, to them
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.480]   this was blasphemy. It was blasphemy, they said, against Moses. It was blasphemy
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.960]   against the temple. It was blasphemy against the law of God. So they've
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.280]   arrested Stephen and they put him on trial, and now he's invited by the high
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.160]   priest to speak for himself. The high priest addressing him says, "Are these
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.520]   things so?" Stephen begins his reply. What is his reply? Well, let me remind you
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.160]   very hurriedly of it again. It's a most amazing statement, this. Here you've got a
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.000]   wonderful kind of summary of the Christian gospel and how it is presented
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.280]   and presented to people like these Jews in particular, but presented to all. What
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   he does is he takes them through their own history. They're very proud of this
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.320]   history, but he takes them through it in order to show them that they've never
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.640]   understood it, indeed that they've misunderstood it. And he goes on to show
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   them that now in rejecting the Lord Jesus Christ and his gospel, they are
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.880]   simply doing in their day and generation what their fathers had been doing
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.400]   throughout the running centuries. It had been the great characteristic of these
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.080]   people. So he opens this up before them, and he does so by recapitulating the
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.680]   history. He starts with Abram, deals with that, comes on to the case of Joseph,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.400]   deals with that. He shows them, reminds them how Joseph's brethren rejected him
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.280]   and dealt with him in an abominable manner, even as they are doing with the
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.240]   Son of God. Then he comes to this crucial case of Moses. This is the one that's
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.280]   occupying our attention now. He's taken them through the salient features in the
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   history of Moses. And having done that, and having remounted them, he brought
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.320]   them out after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.400]   and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness forty years. There's the end, as it were,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.200]   the story of Moses. He now turns to them and says, "This is that Moses which said
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.400]   unto the children of Israel, 'The prophets of the Lord your God raise up
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.200]   unto you of your brethren like unto me.'" He's also the same Moses that was with
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.040]   the gathering of God's people in the wilderness. And he was the same Moses who
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   stood, as it were, between God and men. He spake with the angel which spake to him
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.640]   in the Mount Sinai, but he also spake with our fathers. He's the same Moses who
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.800]   received the lively oracles to give unto us. Now this is most important because
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.320]   here Stephen is singling out, as it were, the thing that made Moses the one, the
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.840]   men he was. And you notice there were two things about him. He's the great lawgiver.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.320]   At least he's the man through whom the law was given. They called him the
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.680]   lawgiver. That's the first thing. The second thing was that he was a prophet.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.200]   He prophesied the coming of the Son of God. So you've got combined in this one
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   person of Moses the law and the prophets. Now that's a summary of the whole of the
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.820]   Old Testament. That's what the Old Testament is. It's the law and the
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.800]   prophets. And here in this man Moses you get these two things meeting together.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.960]   But now the point that is made by Stephen is this. What was it that after
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.760]   all had made the Jews such a remarkable people, such a unique people? Why did they
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.920]   stand out amongst all the nations of the world? It wasn't their bigness, it wasn't
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.800]   their size, it wasn't their natural ability. They were a small nation, an
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.400]   agricultural people, an unimportant nation in many ways, and yet they
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.960]   stand out and they were of great importance. What was it that made them
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.600]   the people they were? Now the answer is it is this word of God that came to them,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   these living oracles, this word from God himself that they'd received. That is the
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.720]   whole secret of the life and the amazing story of these people. And yet, as Stephen
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.280]   has to point out to the Sanhedrin, though they were the people of God, they're
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.600]   often in trouble, and that was always because they turned their backs on God,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.000]   or because they refused to listen to the Word of God. The whole story of the
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.720]   children of Israel is this, that when they listen to this word all is well with
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.680]   them. When they don't, things go wrong. Now that's the point that Stephen is
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:38.400]   anxious to establish. He is putting it to these members of the Sanhedrin. They are
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.080]   rejecting the Word of God. That's what they're doing. In rejecting Jesus of
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   Nazareth, the Son of God, they are rejecting the Word of God. And this is
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.680]   the most terrible thing that people can ever do. That's the thing he brings on, and
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.160]   that is the thing, my dear friends, I am trying to bring home to you. The most
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:14.760]   important thing that anybody ever does in this world is to listen to this word.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:21.000]   Now this is the point I say that is being established by Stephen. I want to
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.560]   put it to you in its modern form. Why is it that men and women are not Christian?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.200]   Why is it that the vast majority of people in this country today are not
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.760]   Christian? That's the great question. Or let me put it in a different form. Why is
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:44.040]   the world as it is? Why is the world in trouble? Here's all we need. We've got the
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.200]   full answer here, and yet the world is in trouble. Why not? Well, the answer is, it
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.240]   won't listen to this word. It refuses it, rejects it, dismisses it. As the members
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.800]   of the Sanhedrin were doing, men and women are still doing exactly the same
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   at the present time. Now why do they do this? This is the most important question.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.040]   Well, I am suggesting, I began suggesting it last Sunday night, what I'm suggesting
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.760]   is this, that we go wrong at the very beginning, we go wrong in our very
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.680]   approach to it. And the first great error, the cardinal error of which we are
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.760]   guilty always, is that we don't realize the uniqueness of this word. What's that?
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:37.560]   Well, that it is the oracle of God. It is the Word of God himself. Now, I tried to
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.640]   demonstrate that last Sunday night. This, you see, is entirely different from
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.400]   everything else. This isn't philosophy, this isn't men trying to arrive at a
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.840]   knowledge of the truth. This is God revealing the truth. This is the point
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.560]   made by Stephen about Moses. This Moses, the one I'm talking about, he said, is the
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:03.640]   one who received the living oracles to give to you. Moses didn't go up onto the
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.000]   mountain in order to do a bit of research work. He didn't go up there in
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.840]   order to be free from the ordinary tasks of life, in order that he might
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.240]   concentrate upon his thinking, or work out the great problem and arrive at a
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.840]   solution, and then write it down. Nothing of the sort. He just held out his hands,
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.000]   he received. You see, the first thing we've got to realize is this, that in
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.280]   this book which we call the Bible, we have an utterly unique message. This is
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:40.240]   revelation. This is God teaching us, telling us these vital things that are
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.200]   essential to our salvation and to our well-being. And I gave you examples and
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.920]   illustrations of how God has given this revelation. This, giving it to Moses on
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.720]   the mountain, is only one of a whole series of similar acts. You get it in all
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.200]   the great prophets. The word of the Lord came, the burden of the Lord. They
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.720]   sometimes didn't want it. Jeremiah didn't want to speak. Jeremiah knew, and he tells
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.040]   us, that every time he did speak he became very unpopular. They maltreated
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.840]   him, and he said, "I'll never speak again." But the Word of God was like a fire
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   burning in his bones, and he's bound to speak. God speaks to him, and he has to
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:27.120]   speak. The divine afflators, as it were, comes upon him. Now, we also try to
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   demonstrate that all this can be proved by means of prophecy, fulfilled prophecy,
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.360]   which can't be explained in any other way whatsoever. And we ended on this note.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.520]   What have we then got to do? Well, we've got to receive it. The secret of Moses is
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:49.800]   that he received the living oracles. And you and I have got to receive these
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:57.000]   living oracles, this Word of God, this revelation. My dear friends, I'm not here
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.680]   to give my own ideas. I'm not here to give my own thoughts, my own reflections,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.760]   my own point of view. God forbid that I should attempt that. Who am I to tell
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.000]   other people how to live or what to do? Who am I to tell statesmen what to do? I
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.880]   haven't the knowledge, I haven't the ability. I'm a mouthpiece, I'm
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.080]   nothing but a channel, I'm a vehicle. And what have I got? Well, I've got the Word
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:26.640]   of God before me. I've got a revelation. This is God's living Word, his oracle. And
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.080]   I'm simply holding this before you and commending it to you, and urging upon you
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:37.840]   to submit to it and to believe it. But now the question arises, why is it then
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.320]   that the world doesn't believe this? Well, I'm answering that question. That's what
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.280]   I'm trying to do. I'm trying to do what Stephen was doing with the members of
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.600]   the Sanhedrin. What's the matter? Well, that's the first thing that people don't
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.680]   realize, that it's all a matter of revelation. But there are further things
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.920]   they don't realize, and the one I want to concentrate on tonight is this word
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:12.400]   "lively." Who received the lively oracles to give unto us? What does this mean? Well,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.080]   a better translation is, of course, living. The living oracles. Don't forget that an
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.600]   oracle is a word spoken by a God. And here he's referring to the Word of God,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.240]   the Living God, the only true and living God. And he says that this word is a
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.640]   living word, it is a lively word. I want to deal with this, because this is such a
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.720]   vital matter, and I want to deal with it in particular as it is expanded for us
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   in the portion of Scripture we read at the beginning, especially in Hebrews
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:54.280]   chapter 4, verses 12 and 13. Listen, the Word of God is quick. That means living
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   again, same thing. The Word of God is quick, living, lively, and powerful, and
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.520]   sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.560]   soul and spirit of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.480]   the intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:29.040]   in his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:39.920]   we have to do. What a commentary upon this expression, living or lively oracles.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.000]   It's not confined to this epistle to the Hebrews. You see, all these men, they're
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.600]   saying the same thing. Listen to Peter saying it. He says, "Seeing ye have purified
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.080]   your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.800]   brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart, fervently being born
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:08.080]   again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God, which
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.840]   liveth and abideth forever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of men
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.560]   is the flower of grass. The grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:26.800]   away, but the Word of the Lord endureth forever, and this is the Word which by
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:35.560]   the gospel is preached unto you." That's what I'm privileged to do, my friend.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:42.760]   What's this book? It's God speaking. The Word of God, which liveth and abideth
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.440]   forever. It's the Word of the Old Testament, law and prophets. It's the Word
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.560]   of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's the Word of the Apostles. It's the Word of the
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.920]   confessors and the martyrs, the great reformers. Thank God it's the Word of a
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:07.080]   little humble preacher in London in 1967. The same Word, because it is the Word of
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:13.200]   the living God. That's what we are considering. Well now then, let's consider
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:19.640]   what this means. Why should I listen to this, says someone? I'm going to answer you.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:26.760]   Let me give you something about the general characteristics of this Word, or
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:34.480]   these words of God. General character. Well, we've already seen it is the Word
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.000]   of God. Do you know if we haven't got anything else that's enough for us.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.320]   Aren't you rather tired of the words of men? I'm thoroughly tired of them. Now I
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.560]   don't want to say a word against anybody, philosophers, politicians, nor anything
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:54.240]   else, but my friends, I'm rather tired of them. Aren't you tired of them? Isn't it
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.440]   about time the world began to listen to the Word of God? In its bankruptcy, in its
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.280]   penury, in its despair, in its hopelessness, in its failure, in its shame.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.800]   This is the whole trouble with the world tonight. It's not listening to the Word of
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:21.600]   God. But let's go on. It's a living Word. It's alive. What does he mean by that? Why
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.040]   does he talk about the lively oracles, the living oracles? Why does the author
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.920]   of the epistle of the Hebrews say the Word of God is quick, the Word of God is
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.960]   living, it's alive, it's instinct with life. What's he mean? Well, you see, what
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.760]   he's really saying is this, and we've got to emphasize this, it's as true now as
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.960]   it's ever been. That is where it is eternally different from every
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:51.360]   philosophy. Philosophies are not alive. Why not? Well, because they're always
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:57.840]   dependent upon us. They're dependent upon our abilities, upon our strength, upon
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.680]   our qualities and powers. They've got nothing in themselves. We have to produce
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.320]   them. We have to think them out. We have to write them. We have to publish them. We
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.160]   present them. It's all our activity, and we all the time are having to push these
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.040]   words and to do something about them. But you see, this Word is altogether
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:23.600]   different. This Word is alive. This Word has got life in itself, and that is what
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.520]   makes this Word so different from every other Word. This is a Word that comes to
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:35.080]   us, and it addresses us, it speaks to us. It's something apart from us. Its life is
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.360]   not in us and doesn't depend upon us. It's all in itself. It's a life, a life,
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:47.480]   alive Word. It's a living Word. It's a Word that has got this life in and of
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.480]   itself. In other words, here is a Word that, I say, addresses us. It comes to us.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:59.960]   It speaks to us. It awakens us. It arouses us. These are the characteristics of this
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:06.480]   great Word, and that's all summed up in the word "alive" or "living." Oh, what a
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.320]   wonderful contrast this is with the words of men. Don't you feel as you
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.880]   listen to them and as you read them that they're already lifeless? They seem to
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.560]   die as they come over the lips of men. They haven't got any power in them. They
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:30.480]   haven't got any vigor. They don't come to us, as it were. We make the effort, and it
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.960]   demands that of us. Now, there is that first great contrast, but I want to go on
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:41.400]   and emphasize this, that this is a Word that not only is always alive and
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.160]   there's that as its inherent essential characteristic, it is a Word that is
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:52.600]   continually alive. That's inherent in this word "quick." Not only has it got life
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.880]   and is alive, it's always alive. Now, that's where this word is so different.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:04.440]   We talk about dead languages, don't we? Dead languages. Latin and Greek. Dead
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.840]   languages. This isn't a dead language. Parts of it is older than they are, but
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:17.320]   this isn't a dead language. This is a word that never dies. Now, again, let me
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.240]   contrast it with philosophy. Take the great teachings of the great philosophers
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:27.020]   of Greece, who flourished before our Lord ever came into this world. Well, we've got
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.840]   their teachings, we've got their philosophies, but you know
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.920]   they're largely now something which is of antiquarian interest. They're dead.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.480]   They're ancient philosophies. They're of interest to students only. Well, they
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.440]   tried to, the authorities tried to show us that they've got something to say to
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   us today, and they are of contemporary relevance, but we know as we read them
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.720]   and as we listen to them that they didn't accomplish anything in their own
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.840]   day and generation, and they've never been able to do anything since then. But
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:04.600]   there they are. But this is in an entirely different category. It's an old
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.960]   word. It's a very old book, this. One of the oldest books in the world. And yet
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.840]   this is the amazing and the astonishing thing. It is as alive tonight as it ever
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.120]   has been. Moses received the living oracles. This word that I'm privileged to
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.760]   handle tonight is as alive as it was in the days of Moses. It's as alive as it
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.720]   has ever been. This is the astounding thing. It's a part of this living
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   quality that belongs to it. It's always contemporary. It is always up to date.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.280]   Now this is something I want to open out a little before you for this reason.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.160]   There are so many people today, this year. It's astonishing, this year, that intelligent
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.320]   people can any longer go to a place of worship like this on a Sunday night.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.440]   Astonishing that any intelligent people in this enlightened scientific age can
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.680]   possibly go on studying that old book. What on earth has that got to say to us
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.360]   in the middle of the 20th century with all our teeming problems? What's it got
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.760]   to say to us? It's an old word. It's finished. It was all right at one time. It
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.240]   no doubt had something to say to its own generation. But what's it got to say to
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.560]   us now? What interest have we got in Moses and all these things and Old
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.880]   Testament and New Testament? What's it got to do with the modern man? Now that,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.160]   you see, is the very essence of the modern fellows. The answer is perfectly
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:37.280]   simple. This word is not only alive and up-to-date and contemporary. It is the
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.080]   only word that is truly contemporary and up-to-date. What do I mean? Well, I mean
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.600]   things like this. Look at the problem of the world as it is at the present time.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.160]   How do you face it? Well, I say the first way to face it is this. Where in what is
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:23:00.120]   the world? Where did it come from? Where has the cosmos come from? What is man?
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:07.000]   What is creation? What's everything? Now, you've got to face that. Oh, you see, but
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.960]   science answers the question, does it? Can you get the unanimity amongst your
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.720]   scientists to start with? Can you get anything beyond theories? Contradictory
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.400]   theories, is that it? That's the best you'll get from them. They don't know. You see,
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.440]   you're asked to believe, if you listen to the modern scientific opinion, that the
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.960]   world is probably the result of an accident. Two great planets, you remember,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.880]   passed a bit too near to one another. One knocked a bit off the other, hence the
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.280]   cosmos. But they don't tell us where the planets came from originally. They leave
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.200]   you with great questions, quite unanswered. No, no, I don't want to waste
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.080]   time with this, but you do remember, don't you, the conclusion that a man like Sir
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.640]   James Jeans came unto? It was this, that having studied science all his life, he
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.080]   had come to this conclusion, there must be a great mind behind the universe. And
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.040]   it's the mind, he said, of an arithmetician, a mathematician, a great
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.760]   mathematician. There's no other explanation, but it's the explanation of
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.800]   the Bible. In the beginning, God created. Here it is. So, even when you look at it
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.640]   as broadly as that, this book has got a great deal to say, my friend. And I think
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.280]   you'll find as the years pass, that the theories that have been so popular will
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.960]   disappear like their predecessors did, and you'll still have to come back to
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.760]   this with regard to the whole question of origins. But come to a still more
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:36.320]   urgent practical question for us. Why is the world as it is? There's the second
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:43.280]   great contemporary question. Whatever the origin is, why is the world as it is? Why
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.960]   the trouble? Why the wars? Why the confusion? Why the unhappiness? Why the
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.760]   moral problem? Why all this? Now, here is the urgent question. The problem that's
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.040]   concerning them at the home office. Juvenile delinquency, drugs, doping, all
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.520]   that we read of in our papers and hear on the news so constantly, until we all
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.040]   must despair. But you see, the great question to ask is this, why? What is it?
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:15.160]   What's the cause of it? And I am here to suggest to you that the only modern
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:23.520]   up-to-date answer is the answer that's given here, and it's nowhere else. It's in
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:30.880]   the Old Testament, part of the law and the prophets. "There is no peace, saith my God,
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:37.320]   to the wicked." There is all. Doesn't matter how wealthy you are, says the Bible, doesn't
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.640]   matter how sophisticated, doesn't matter how highly developed intellectually,
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.200]   politically, or in any other respect. If you are wicked, if you're in the wrong
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.760]   relationship to God, you'll not have peace. And this great 20th century of
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.520]   ours, towering over all others in knowledge and discovery and understanding,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:02.280]   in wealth and in communications, look at it. There's your explanation. "There is no
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:09.680]   peace, saith my God, to the wicked." The way of the transgression, transgressor is
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.160]   hard. You disobey the law of God, given to Moses the Ten Commandments, and you'll
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.480]   pay for it, you'll suffer for it, doesn't matter who you are, whether individual or
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:27.120]   nation or world. Here is the answer, the only answer. This message is as
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:34.760]   contemporary tonight as it has ever been, and it is the only message that holds
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:41.560]   out any hope or way of salvation. I needn't waste time over this, need I? Have the
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.120]   politicians got the answer? Have the philosophers got the answer? Have any of
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.520]   your wise men got the answer? We know they haven't, they're completely bankrupt.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.440]   Here is the only answer. You are doing the wisest thing of all people in this
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   country tonight. You are listening to the word of the living God, this word that's
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   alive, that is speaking to the contemporary situation, to the modern men,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.560]   in a way that nothing else can do. But we can go further, and we can say that it
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:15.680]   will always be alive. It's the everlasting gospel, the word of God that
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.560]   liveth and abideth forever. You see, it's got life in it, it's the life of God in
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.080]   it, and it's eternal. It'll never end, it'll never date, it'll never fail. No, you
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.600]   can't say that about anything else. You can't say that about the words of any
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:36.880]   man. I'm old enough to have seen how the words of men die. I remember the words of
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.320]   a great orator in the First World War. People remember nothing today of what he
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.680]   said. They're already forgetting the words of Sir Winston Churchill. They'll
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.400]   soon be forgotten altogether. You remember twenty years ago and a little
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.560]   more, we thought these words are imperishable, these last. They don't last.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.800]   The words of men are dying words. They begin to die the moment they're uttered,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.680]   and they cease to speak to us or have anything to say to us. And haven't you
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:10.080]   noticed about those words of men? They depend so much upon us as I say. There are
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   words that speak to us when we're children. We ridicule them when we become
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.600]   adolescents. They say nothing to us when we're middle-aged. They're useless when
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.680]   we're old and dying. You see, they all depend upon these various factors. Some
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.880]   words speak to us when I'm well and healthy. Others only speak to me when I'm
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.200]   ill. Some speak to me when everything's going well with me, and then they don't
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.720]   speak to me when things go wrong and go against me. There is only one word that
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.760]   goes on speaking and speaks always, whatever my state, whatever my condition,
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:51.160]   whatever my circumstances. It woke our wandering childhood to muse on things
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:29:00.360]   above. It drew our harder manhood with chords of mighty love. Here is the only
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:06.640]   word that speaks in life, speaks in death. Wherever I am, whatever my conditions and
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.600]   circumstances, here is a word that goes on speaking. It's a living word. It's a
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.920]   life. It's got the power of God, the life of God as it were in it. Now that's the
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   first thing that we get out of this word "living". But that introduces the second,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.760]   which is this very element of power that I've just mentioned. And this is the most
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:38.680]   remarkable feature of all about this word. It's a word that does things. It's a
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.280]   word that produces effects. This is because it's the Word of God, because
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.200]   it's alive, but it's got power in it. Now the Bible is always emphasizing this. This
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:57.160]   is the kind of thing that it says about itself. He spake, and it was done. Or listen
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.760]   to Jeremiah saying it. Is not my word as a fire and as a hammer that breaketh the
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:09.720]   rocks in pieces? Here's a word with power in it. It's like a fire. It's like a hammer.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:16.040]   It can break rocks. No word of men can do this. This word can do this. Or take
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:24.680]   another. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved. He uttered his voice. The earth
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:32.200]   melted. His voice, his word. And when he utters it, when he speaks, the earth
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:38.480]   melts before him. What a word. Now this is the reason I say why we should be
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.040]   listening to this word. Because of this power that is in it. This is what you're
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.200]   listening to, my friend. Look at it in this way. Look at it in general. The power
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.280]   of this word looked at in a mere general sense. I've already referred to creation.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:01.680]   And that is how everything has come into being. In the beginning God created. How
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:09.400]   did he create? Well we are told. He said, "Let there be light." And there was light.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:17.280]   That's the power of the Word of God. He speak, it was done. He commands, it comes
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.080]   forth. Now do you realize that that is the kind of word that you've got in the
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.240]   Scriptures? The word that I'm privileged to hold before you at this moment? You
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.400]   see this is not men. Men can't speak like this. Men can't do things like this. But
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:39.240]   God can. It's the Word that has produced the entire cosmos. And it's upheld by the
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:47.400]   Word of his power. And did you know this? That it is the same power that can
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.280]   punish the world. What happened at the flood? God spake again. God commanded. God
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:00.840]   said to the heavens, "Open, send down." And it came down. His Word. The power of God.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.420]   You get the same thing in connection with the giving of the law. Stephen is
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:12.040]   concerned about Moses up on the mount receiving the living oracles from God.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.600]   And you remember the description of that which we are given in the 19th chapter
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:24.760]   of the book of Exodus? God spake the law and as he did the mountain quaked. The
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:32.120]   smoke appeared, the thick darkness, the power of God spoken in the Word as he
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:37.160]   was giving the law. And we've already had it in this seventh chapter of the
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.400]   book of the Acts of the Apostles. There's a man called Abram living in Ur of the
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.320]   Chaldees doing what his forefathers had always done before him and God suddenly
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:55.480]   appears to him and says, "Come out, get thee out." He goes out. The Word that came to
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.400]   Joseph, the Word that came to Moses at the bush, speaking in the flame of fire,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   and Moses felt the power, the command, and had to act. This is the characteristic
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:14.760]   of this Word everywhere. It is a Word that enables men to work miracles. You've
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:20.600]   got them in your Old Testament. This is how it happens. When God gives a man his
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.160]   Word, he gives him power. Here are the children of Israel led by Moses but
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.200]   they've got no water. And what happens? God commands Moses to command the rock
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:38.400]   to pour forth water. And Moses speaks and the water comes forth. This is the Word of
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:46.320]   God. It's a powerful Word. It's a mighty Word. The Word that enabled Elijah
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.480]   to work similar miracles, that can take a feeble man and so fill him with power,
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.920]   that his Word becomes a command. But of course, if you really want to see all
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.780]   this, you've got to look at the Blessed Lord himself as you find him in the
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.720]   pages of the four Gospels. My dear friends, have you ever followed him as it
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.200]   were? Have you listened to him? Have you joined the crowd and have you stood
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.480]   amongst them and have you listened to him? Listen to them after he spoke and
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.640]   this is what they say, "This man speaketh with authority and not as the scribes."
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:23.680]   Never men speak like this man. What is this? When they said his Word is with
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.940]   power. Have you felt that? Have you noticed that? Have you noticed the
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.440]   difference between his manner of speech and his Word and that of all teachers
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.600]   who've gone before him? There is nothing tentative. There is now no suggestion. He
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:46.480]   doesn't merely put it to us. He speaks and he speaks with authority. Have you
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   noticed it in his miracles? He works his miracles by speaking. There he is one day
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.160]   very tired and they're crossing the sea and he's gone to the hinder part of the
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.000]   ship and he's lying down and he's fallen asleep and a great storm arose and the
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.640]   poor apostles are troubled and in despair. The billows are rolling and the
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.800]   wind is howling and they're afraid they're going to drown at any moment and
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:19.240]   they awaken him. "Master, carest thou not that he perish?" And he arose and he said to
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   the sea and to the wind, "Peace! Be still!" And there was a great calm. Have you noticed this?
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   He can commend the lame to walk. He can commend the man whose arm was withered
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.360]   hanging helpless by his side. He says to the men, "Stretch forth thy hand!" And the men
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:46.720]   stretched forth his hand. The Word puts power into a paralyzed arm. But you
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   remember the most striking example and illustration of all? He had a great
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   friend called Lazarus. Lazarus died and our Lord eventually arrives after
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   Lazarus has been in the grave for four days and the two sisters are
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:11.200]   weeping and wailing, breaking their hearts. But he goes and there he stands
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:17.520]   looking at the tomb and he just stood and he said with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:25.360]   forth!" And Lazarus came forth. My friends, this is what we are considering together.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.320]   Men can't do things like this. This is the Word that we are considering. But it
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.520]   isn't confined to our blessed Lord. He was able to give it to apostles. Look at
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.000]   Peter and John. We've already considered it in the third chapter. Going up to the
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.480]   temple one afternoon at the hour of prayer, confronted by the men born lame,
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.200]   set every day on the pavement outside the beautiful gate of the temple. Nobody
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.400]   could do anything for him. Peter and John fastened their eyes upon him and Peter
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:56.840]   says, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee in the name of
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:05.680]   Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and walk!" And he did so, immediately. And that's
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.360]   the great record that we have in this book. Stephen's on trial, the others are
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.040]   on trial, because of these very miracles. But look at it likewise in the
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.840]   preaching. Look at the words of these men. Look at a man like Peter, a fisherman. A
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.520]   man who's never had any training or education. An illiterate man, an
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.800]   ignorant man. But he stands up on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem and he expounds
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.680]   the Scriptures. You can read it for yourself in the second chapter of the
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.720]   book of the Acts of the Apostles. And you may say, "What is there here? What is there?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.940]   Is there anything remarkable?" Well, this is what I know. That after Peter had been
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:47.680]   preaching for a while, men began to shout out saying, "Men and brethren, what
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:54.480]   shall we do?" Pricked in their hearts. "What is this?" "Oh, it's the power of this
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.840]   Word of God." And the Apostle Paul says the same about himself. He says to the
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.880]   Corinthians, "When I came amongst you, I came not with enticing words of men's
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.080]   wisdom. He came rather in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." Why? "Well, that
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.520]   the power might be of God." He was preaching in demonstration of the Spirit
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.240]   and of power. Here is a word that can turn the world upside down, has changed
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:26.080]   the whole course of history. You can't understand history except in terms of
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:34.800]   this amazing Word. But for me to come to the most vital and urgent matter of all
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:42.080]   for us, you see the power of this Word when it deals with us from the standpoint
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.520]   of salvation. And what are we told about it? Well, listen, this is what we are told.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.000]   The Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.480]   piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and joints and marrow,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.200]   and it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. What is it?
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.320]   Well, let me summarize it like this. It's a convicting Word. It's a deep Word.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:16.600]   It's a penetrating Word. Oh, the contrast it presents to the words of men, how
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.520]   superficial they are, how superficial the words of the politicians and the
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.840]   philosophers are. But the psychologists, you see, they have deep analysis. Here is
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.760]   the depth. They'll analyze you. When you put their analysis by the side of this,
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.380]   it's toying and playing like ripples on the very surface. No, no. Here's the only
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:43.960]   Word that really can convict, it can penetrate. Notice the terms used.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.600]   Two-edged sword. Not merely one edge, two edges. It cuts twice. It cuts thoroughly.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:55.320]   It's sharper. That's a Word which means that it's incisive, it's penetrating.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.840]   It's got a quality that enables it to go right down. It lays bare all
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:07.520]   self-delusions, all sophistries, all pretenses and excuses. It's sharper than
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:16.200]   the two-edged sword. It penetrates, dividing asunder even the soul and
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:23.480]   spirit, and the joints and marrow. What that means is this, you see, that it gets
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.600]   down to every part and portion of life. Now there is nothing else that does that
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.920]   to you. Some teachings affect you in one part of your experience, others in
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:38.860]   another. Here is a Word that deals with every single part. It analyzes, it
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:44.120]   dissects, it opens out soul and spirit, joints and marrow. There is nothing about
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:53.480]   us that it doesn't know. And I am told that it is a discerner of the thoughts
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.840]   and intents of the heart. What does that mean? Well it means by discerner that
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.240]   it's got a judging quality, a discriminating quality. It can, like a
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   judge on the bench, it can sift and analyze the evidence. The advocate
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.400]   puts it very plausibly and he doesn't say certain things, he brings others out
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.920]   and exaggerates them. Ah, but the judge is sitting on the bench, he sifts, he can
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.280]   discriminate, he can analyze, he puts the relative and due proportion to every
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.800]   statement that is made. That's the content of the word discerner. And it does
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:36.400]   this with the very thoughts and intents of our hearts, our reflections, our
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.600]   imaginations, our ideas, our conceptions. And it does it at the depth of our being
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   in that which is called the heart. And then to sum it up he says, neither is
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:54.880]   there any creature that is not made manifest in his sight, but all things are
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:02.640]   naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. What does all this
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:12.000]   mean? Well what it means is this. Here is the only word in the world tonight that
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:22.720]   exposes the real problem of the human race. The only one. Nothing else. All the
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.520]   others, you're familiar with them, some of them say that what we lack is knowledge,
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:32.760]   education, culture. Others say, no, what we really need is more money, better
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.680]   conditions, better houses to live in, more traveling facilities, better food.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   They've got all, they've all got their little remedies, but there is none of
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.000]   them that really faces the real and the essential problem of the world and the
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.440]   human race at this moment. Here is the only one that penetrates right down to
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:03.920]   the depths. It exposes it, it reveals it, and it is man disobedient to God, man not
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.720]   listening to the living oracle, man rebelling, raising himself up against God.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:16.120]   It's the only answer I've already suggested it to you. But here is the only
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:25.920]   word also that tells us the full truth about ourselves. None other. Your
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.320]   politicians never tell you the truth about yourselves, they want your vote,
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.680]   they want your suffering. The philosophers never tell us the truth
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.120]   about ourselves. They want us to believe that there is no such thing as sin, no
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.600]   such thing as evil, that these are but negative qualities, absence of qualities.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:51.840]   It's not the truth. They, none of us, tell us that sin is positive, that it's active,
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.680]   that it's a power. None of them tell you that. They hate it, they speak against it.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   Here is the only thing that tells us the full truth about ourselves. We all like
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:05.600]   to have a good conceit of ourselves, but here is a word that tells me that I am
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.840]   so hopeless that nothing but a new birth can ever put me right. I can't be
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.960]   improved even. I've got to be made anew, I've got to be born again. I really need
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:20.000]   a new heart and a new spirit within me. The only one that really gets down to it.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.240]   Here it is with its analysis, its discrimination, its penetrating quality,
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:34.560]   and there I'm exposed, I'm rotten. And here is a word that always exposes my
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.920]   attempts at hypocrisy, attempts at rationalizing, all my attempts at
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:46.520]   pretense and a show. Don't you see it all happening in the life of our blessed
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:54.440]   Lord himself? Why did the Pharisees so hate him? Why were they so malicious
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.240]   against him? Our Lord, at the beginning particularly, never attacked the
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.800]   Pharisees, he never criticized them. Why were they so bitter? Why were they
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.680]   against him? Why did they resent him? Why did they object to him? You know there's
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:12.200]   only one answer. He exposed their hypocrisy. They realized it. As he spoke,
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.560]   he spoke about the depths. They were the teachers, they were better than other
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.040]   people. They could hide and they could manipulate. They said as long as you don't
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.560]   actually commit adultery, you're not guilty of adultery. Though they committed
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.280]   it in their hearts, he exposed the heart. He exposed the thoughts. Whence come evil
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.680]   thoughts, murders, adulteries? It isn't that which goes in, it's that which comes
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.720]   out. Your hearts are black, he said. That's the cause of the trouble. And they hated him.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.400]   They needed to be saved as much as the public and of the sinner, and they
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.520]   wouldn't have it. But he exposes hypocrisy and pretends. You remember him
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.040]   and the woman caught in adultery, and here are her accusers. He stoops down and he
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:56.160]   writes on the sand, and they all slink out. This is because of this word of his
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.400]   that is always quick and powerful, analytical, discerning, penetrating,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:07.940]   leaving everything exposed. Nothing can be hidden. And my dear friends, this is a
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:15.320]   word that faces us with the one of the only two destinies that face us all. Here
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:23.520]   is a word that confronts you with a choice which you've got to take. Moses
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:29.720]   did that, didn't he? He was given this living word on the mount, and he preached
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:35.040]   it to the people. And do you remember how he left them at the end of his life? He
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.560]   knows that he's going. He calls the people together, and this is what he says
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:47.640]   to them, "Behold, I set before you this day life and good, and death and evil."
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   That's what this word does. It's the only word that does that. The words of men,
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.120]   they can address you on other things. Are the rates to go up or to go down? Are we to
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.240]   have a certain type of education or not? They can speak to you about these
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.480]   things. And of course these things are of importance, they're of temporary
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.120]   importance. But you know there's not one of them, and putting your philosophers
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.840]   and poets with them, there's not one of them that faces you with the ultimate
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:21.920]   question. It's God or man. It is life and good, or it is death and evil. It is
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:27.040]   mandebal or garrison. It's this way or that way. Your house is either on the
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.400]   rock or it's on the sand. There are only two ways, the narrow way, the broad way.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:38.800]   Here you see your broad face to face with fundamental issues and the ultimate
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:47.680]   destiny of life. And it's here and here alone. Our fourth chapter of Hebrews
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.320]   referred to Joshua, and you remember that when he came to die he put the same
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:48:00.360]   choice to the people Jews this day, he says, whom he will serve. And that is why
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.600]   you and I should listen to this word. That is why Stephen pleads with the
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.920]   Sanhedrin to do it. That's why the author of the epistle to the Hebrews pleads
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:15.000]   with these Hebrew Christians. My friend, your eternal destiny is dependent upon
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.120]   your reaction to this word. That's the whole argument of this man. He said, think
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.400]   of your forefathers. They heard the word, but they died in the wilderness. They
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.640]   never entered the land of Canaan. Why? Well, because it wasn't mixed with faith
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:37.880]   in them that heard it. But lastly, this is the only word that is able to give us
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:46.560]   salvation. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Why not? For it is the power of
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:55.640]   God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. This is a word that shown me
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:01.040]   what I am, revealed it all to me in its ugliness and foulness and helplessness.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.400]   But thank God, it doesn't leave me there. The Moses that received the law that
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.280]   condemns us was able to prophesy of the coming of the Savior, the Deliverer. And
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.640]   here is the great message. This man in the fourth of Hebrews leads up to it,
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.400]   saying then that we have a great high priest that is fast through the heavens,
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   Jesus the Son of God. Let's hold on to him. Let's hold fast the profession, the
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:36.360]   Savior, the glorious, the mighty salvation. There remaineth a rest for the people of
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:43.840]   God. My dear friend, here's the only word in the world tonight that can speak to
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.840]   you when you know you're lost, when you're condemned, when you're a failure,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.640]   when sin gets you down, when you're afraid of death and afraid of the
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.600]   judgment and afraid of eternity. Here is the only word that can speak to you,
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:02.240]   comfort and peace and give you hope. For what does it speak? It speaks a message
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:10.080]   of forgiveness. Here is a word that in the mouth of the Lord himself could turn
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:17.720]   to the vilest kind of sinner and say, "Son, thy sins are forgiven thee." Or to the
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:23.120]   woman caught in the act of adultery, "Where are these thine accusers? Go and
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:31.320]   sin no more." A word of authority that assures us of forgiveness. The men and
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.240]   women cry out to Peter on the day of Pentecost, "Men and brethren, what shall we
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:41.280]   do?" There comes the answer, "Believe, repent every one of you and be baptized in the
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.880]   name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:51.080]   Here it is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.480]   house." Here is an answer, here is a powerful answer. It isn't men suggesting
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.560]   that because God is love he is likely to forgive me. It is the Son of God saying,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.720]   "He will forgive you for I've died for your sins, I've borne your punishment, I've
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:13.760]   given my soul an offering for your sins. Believe on me, come to me." But it not
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:24.080]   only tells me of forgiveness, it tells me that I can have a new start, a new life,
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:34.280]   be born again. It's exposed to me the ruins of my soul. Then he tells me that
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:41.560]   he can give me new life, that I can be born again. He speaks and listening to
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:48.440]   his voice, "New life, the dead will receive you." He can quicken the dead, he can bring
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.600]   into being something that wasn't there, he can give you a new life, a new start, a
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.800]   new everything. He'll fill you with his own power and he'll be with you and lead
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:02.360]   you all the journey until you're safely in the glory. Being born again, not of
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:12.080]   corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God that liveth and abideth
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:18.640]   forever. It's a word that enables you to come boldly to the throne of grace, to
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:28.600]   obtain mercy and to find grace to help in time of need. And it's a word that
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:33.640]   opens out to you the prospect of glory in the presence of God and the holy
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:38.920]   angels. It prepares you for an inheritance which is incorruptible and
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:45.080]   undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven by God for those who
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:52.720]   believe this gospel. But my dear friend, I dare not let you go without reminding
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.400]   you of this. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:07.160]   sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:16.680]   to do. There's to be a final reckoning. There is one with whom we all have to do.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:24.240]   It is the living God. It is appointed unto all men once to die and after death,
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:33.960]   the judgment. And do you know in what terms you will be judged? I can tell you.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:40.600]   You will be judged on the day of judgment in terms of what you've been
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:48.440]   listening to tonight. This word. It not only lasts through the running centuries,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:55.600]   it'll last to all eternity. Listen to our Lord saying this, "I am come, a light into
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:01.400]   the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. And if any
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:09.320]   men hear my words and believe not, I judge him not. For I came not to judge
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   hath one that judges him." What's that? "The word that I have spoken, the same shall
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:37.240]   judge him in the last day." I have got to die, you've got to die, and you've got to
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:42.040]   stand before God in the judgment. He will remind you that he made men in his own
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.840]   image, he made men perfect, that he's given you his law, he's shown you the way
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.160]   of salvation, he's even sent his word, his son into the world. He is the Word of God
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.120]   and he's come, he's done everything that is necessary. I've preached it to you, I've
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.720]   offered it to you, I've said, "Are you having life and good, or death and evil?"
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:10.680]   You can't. Here you are, choosy this day, you've heard it. And if you arrive at that
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:17.520]   bar of eternal judgment and are lost, you will have no excuse at all to give. The
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:29.800]   word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. Neither is
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:38.640]   anything that is hid from his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:44.560]   eyes of him with whom we shall have to reckon. He is the loving God who has
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:50.320]   spoken to us and spoken in these last days in his only Son and spoken to us
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:55.160]   through him, through the broken body and the shed blood of that dear Son. He's
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:59.880]   done everything, there is nothing that God can do more. He's spoken in his life,
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:11.520]   in his death, in his resurrection. Have you heard him? Have you heard this living
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.600]   word? Do you know that your sins are forgiven? Do you feel that there's new
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.400]   life in you? Are you aware that you've become a child of God? Are you beginning
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:29.880]   to look forward to that eternity that awaits you and all the people of God? My
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:39.680]   dear friends, this is a living word because it is the word of the living God
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:47.400]   himself. God grant that no one may go out of this service without having heard it.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:58.480]   It's the word that tells of life, it's the word that gives life, and life more abundantly.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:04.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
