[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.600]   - Today we talk with our friend, Jackie Hill Perry.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.400]   The month of May was a huge one for her.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.320]   Her second daughter arrived
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.960]   and her second album dropped, "Crescendo",
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.320]   which you just heard.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.760]   Jackie, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.920]   But first, as we record this,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.720]   last night we found out that the LA Lakers
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.280]   signed LeBron James, the huge news.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240]   This is big news for you.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.840]   Why is it such a big news for you?
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840]   - 'Cause I like LeBron
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.200]   and it was just so sad to see him lose.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   I just, I don't like, I do not like go to state,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.320]   like with a passion.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.920]   - It is certainly sad to see LeBron lose in the finals.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040]   And I think now we can watch him lose before the finals.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.880]   - You think so?
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.720]   - I do, I do.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.640]   - I heard Kawhi Leonard might sign.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   If that happens, I don't see that happening.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.320]   - Maybe.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.840]   I don't think any configuration around LeBron
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.760]   can beat the Warriors.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.560]   But we're not here to talk about LeBron and the Warriors.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.760]   No, we are here to talk about @JackieOperi
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.360]   because you are quite gifted on social media.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.120]   And I followed you for some time,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.000]   always to great benefit myself.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880]   So I wanna talk with you over the next few days
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520]   about some of your most viral tweets,
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.840]   or the tweets that I've encapsulated,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320]   something really profound that I want you to expound on.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.640]   And I want you to begin today with this struggle
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.320]   to cling to God, to cling to God when life is easy.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960]   You said it like this, quote,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.640]   "I wonder if with all the sermons and books
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.920]   "on how to hold on to God during suffering,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.400]   "if there should be just as much, if not more,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.280]   "on how to stay near God during seasons of ease.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.840]   "I've seen more Christians drift from God
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   "when life was a breeze than I have when life was hard."
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.800]   Wow, expand on that truth.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.360]   - Yeah, I mean, I think personally,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.120]   I've seen in my life where when I'm going through something,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.360]   when there are trials and tribulations
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240]   and difficulties and hardships,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.600]   I seem to be a lot more attentive to God
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.000]   than I am when life is kind of easy.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.600]   And I think I saw it in the scriptures
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.240]   when I was studying for Deuteronomy 5
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.680]   when I taught at the Gospel Coalition Women's Conference.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.120]   And in Deuteronomy 8, there was this section
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.160]   where God was telling them how he's bringing them
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.920]   into a good land, a land full of milk and honey,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.680]   you got water, you don't have manna anymore,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.280]   like all of this type of stuff.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.560]   And then God says, "Take care,
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.640]   "lest you forget the Lord your God
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.520]   "when you enter this good land."
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   And then he says, "When you get there,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400]   "don't assume that all the good stuff is yours."
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640]   And so I think in essence,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520]   that's what we're all prone to do
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.320]   is that when we enter into seasons
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.160]   where things seem to be abounding,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.560]   where there seems to be an abundance,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.480]   we're not crying a lot, we're not depressed,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   there's just a lot of joy, everybody's good,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.400]   your spouse ain't getting on your nerves,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.000]   your kids are being real obedient,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.040]   your paycheck is coming in consistently,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.320]   there's this tendency to just forget about God,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.800]   to remember that these good gifts are about God,
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.760]   that these good gifts are for God,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.680]   that these good gifts came from God.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   And so I think that's what we do as humans.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.440]   But even Paul, I feel like he has encouraged me personally
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.800]   when I was reading Philippians 4,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.400]   I think where he talks about how
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.080]   he's learned to be a based and abound,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.280]   he's learned to have lack and abundance
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.400]   all because he gets his strength from the Lord.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.880]   And I think a lot of times we read that text to say,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.960]   "Oh, I'm struggling with stuff, I need God's strength."
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.200]   But it's like, no, even when you're not struggling,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.360]   you need God's strength,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.280]   because in essence, you are completely and always needy.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   But when you have a lot of good things going on in your life,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.160]   I think you forget you're as needy as you are.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.480]   And so I think if we keep Jesus before our eyes
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.600]   and see that we always need him,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.000]   whatever season we are in,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.880]   then we'll be able to resist the temptation
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.800]   to stray from him when life is all good.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.200]   - Yeah, really good and helpful.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.960]   I mean, this seems like the flip side of Psalm 73,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.000]   I mean, the prosperity gospel, really.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.960]   "If my life is a breeze, then God must be happy with me."
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.880]   - Well, no, I think God's kindness is layered.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.720]   I think God's kindness looks different
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.680]   depending on the season.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.240]   I think when you look at Jesus,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.640]   Jesus was the most pleasing thing to God,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.200]   and his life was really hard.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.240]   And so I could never assume that my suffering
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   or the lack thereof is somehow related to God's view of me
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.040]   or affection for me.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   He is always good, and he always loves me
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.240]   because I am in Christ Jesus
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.760]   and he created me for himself.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.280]   And so I think if anything,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.440]   what I've learned about the character of God in my trials
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.480]   is that God, he really wants me to know him,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.840]   and he's willing to do that by any means necessary.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.560]   If that means pain, then he's willing to do that
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   because really in my suffering,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.040]   that's when I look the most like Jesus
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.360]   because I'm able to see him rightly.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.880]   - Yeah, so true.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.840]   There's an urgency we must cling to,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.920]   especially when life seems easy.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.400]   That's so helpful, Jackie, thank you very much.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.480]   And we're gonna now break for the weekend,
