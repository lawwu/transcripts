[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the first part of the 18th verse
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.600]   in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.560]   The epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter, and the first portion of the 18th verse.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:29.260]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.080]   Now obviously this is a part of a great statement, so I'd better read again the context, beginning
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.340]   at verse 15, "Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.200]   all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.720]   that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880]   of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him."
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.280]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.160]   and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.800]   of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power which he
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.440]   wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and so on, until the very end of
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.840]   the chapter.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.920]   In other words, we are still continuing our consideration of the prayer of the apostle
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.360]   for these Ephesian Christians, and the other Christians to whom the letter was undoubtedly
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.360]   designated.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:01.520]   He has already thanked God for them, and especially for their faith in the Lord Jesus, and for
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.480]   their love towards all the saints.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.000]   And then he has been making a petition for them.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.560]   He is very careful to remind them, as he always reminded himself, that he was praying to the
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.160]   God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   And what he prayed for them, above everything else, was that God might give them a knowledge
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.080]   of himself.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.760]   That is the supreme thing.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.240]   That is the ultimate goal of Christianity.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.160]   There is nothing beyond that, there is nothing higher than that.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.920]   To know God is indeed everything.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.200]   It includes every other blessing.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.720]   So the apostle puts that obviously in the first position, that they might have this
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   knowledge of God, which, you remember, means not merely a knowledge of what God does, but
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.240]   a direct knowledge of God himself, in a personal and in an intimate sense.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.960]   But then we saw last Sunday morning that the apostle, again, is very careful to say that
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.880]   that is only possible as long as we have the Holy Spirit, whom he describes as the spirit
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.400]   of wisdom and the spirit of revelation.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.480]   Apart from that, I think we saw quite clearly last Sunday morning that the knowledge of
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.560]   God is quite impossible.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.400]   The natural man can never attain unto this knowledge.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   It does not matter how able, how big he is, it is a task which is entirely beyond him.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.160]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.280]   The greatest philosophers can never scale the heights, they can never arrive there.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.200]   It is a knowledge that must be given.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   The natural man understandeth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.560]   Now, that is the first and the most obvious lesson which we all must needs learn.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.740]   And that is why all the talk about the modern man and the special difficulties of today
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.920]   are so completely fatuous.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.760]   The change of the times, the advance of knowledge, is a complete irrelevance in this realm.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.880]   It has nothing to do with it at all.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   Because man, at his best and at his highest, is a complete ignoramus and absolutely helpless
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.000]   face to face with the knowledge of God.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.080]   It is a knowledge that must be imparted, and is imparted, by the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.860]   And even then, though it is held before him, man needs the work of the Spirit internally
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.560]   upon himself before he can receive it.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.800]   Now then, all that is stated in verse 17, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.840]   Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   of him.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.580]   That is the general petition, that is, if you like, the kind of omnibus, all-inclusive
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.440]   petition.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   And having started with that, the apostle comes down to particulars.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.160]   It is invariably his method, this.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.980]   There is no better method conceivable.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.120]   You first of all state the whole, and then you look at it in parts.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.360]   Now he comes here to the particulars, and he is anxious that they should understand
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.280]   three things in particular.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.420]   You notice the three what's.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.360]   He prays that they may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.240]   of his inheritance in the saints, what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.400]   us who believe.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.360]   Now then, there are his three particular petitions.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.680]   And we this morning are going to look at the first of them.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.280]   But you notice that the apostle cannot begin to deal with these particulars without again
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.400]   reminding us of a vital principle.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.440]   He says that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that he may know these
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.840]   three things.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.000]   But why repeat this again?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.600]   He has already said that we need the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of revelation.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.880]   Ah, there I say is this vital principle.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.780]   And the apostle feels that he can't take it for granted.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.360]   It isn't merely an instance of tautology.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.120]   He is not just repeating himself.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   He is emphasizing this most essential truth, without which we are altogether undone.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.600]   He is in effect saying to them, "Well, very well, I've told you that the supreme thing,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.280]   the central thing is to know God himself, yes.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.920]   But I want you to know these subsidiary things, these particulars.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.800]   And yet again I must tell you and remind you that you can only do so to the extent that
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.040]   your understanding is enlightened.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.800]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened."
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.200]   Now, what does he mean by this?
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.760]   Well, this is, I say, not simply a repetition of what he has said before.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.160]   There he stated the thing in general.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.120]   Without the illumination, without the knowledge that is given by the spirit and his general
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.600]   influence upon us, we understand nothing at all.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.800]   Well, how does the Holy Spirit do that?
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:08:01.120]   Well, he does it in particular by enlightening what the apostle here calls "the eyes of
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.600]   our understanding."
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.960]   Now, you will notice that the alternative translations, the other versions, say the
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.200]   eyes of your heart being enlightened.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.080]   It's a question of which manuscript you adopt as being the better.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.540]   But in any case, there is no contradiction.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.800]   In the Bible, the understanding and the heart are often identified.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.440]   The Bible always seems to put it that we understand with our hearts.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.320]   The heart doesn't mean merely the emotions.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.360]   It means the center of personality.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.920]   It means the source of our being and of all our activity.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:43.240]   And therefore the apostle is praying that in a total sense, not merely in an intellectual
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.120]   manner, not merely in an academic or theoretical way, that we may know these things.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.400]   He is praying that rather with our whole being we may come to know them and to respond to
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   them.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   "The eyes of your heart being enlightened."
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.640]   Well, now, what does he mean exactly then by this?
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   It seems to me that the best way to understand it is to realize that this is a contrast to
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.800]   the condition of the natural men.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.960]   In other words, in this very selfsame epistle in chapter 4, verses 17 to 19, the apostle
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:28.360]   shows us what we all are by nature, and why we therefore need to have the eyes of our
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.160]   understanding enlightened.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.160]   Listen to what he says.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:39.200]   "This I say therefore and testify in the Lord, that he henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   walk."
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   Well, how do they walk?
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   Here's the answer.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:50.440]   "In the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:58.920]   the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.840]   heart, who, being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   all uncleanness with greediness."
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:14.240]   Now the operative phrase there is, "having the understanding darkened."
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.480]   And it's because of that they're alienated from the life of God, and are ignorant and
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.280]   are walking therefore in the vanity of their minds.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.480]   Now, what does all this mean to us in practice?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, we can look at it like this.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.400]   What we all need is not a new faculty.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.760]   We all have the faculty.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.520]   The tragedy of men is not so much that he has lost the faculty, but that as the result
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.640]   of sin and evil, he cannot use and exercise his faculties.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.120]   You see, the Apostle is there speaking about the pagans, the unbelieving Gentiles, and
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.480]   what he says about them is that their understanding is darkened.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.560]   They have an understanding, but it's darkened.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.880]   Let me think of a simple illustration.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.600]   There are certain people who have become blind, they can't see.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.400]   They can't even see light.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   What's the matter with them?
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.920]   Well, it isn't that they've lost an eye, they've still got the organ.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920]   What's the matter then?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.360]   Well, is there something wrong with the lens of their eye?
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   Yes, there is.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.560]   But what is wrong is not that the lens has disappeared.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.240]   A film has developed over the lens.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.360]   It's called a cataract.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.200]   There's a kind of opacity.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.440]   The lens is there as it was before, when they could see quite normally.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.720]   But a kind of film has developed over this lens, and therefore, though the light is there
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.160]   and though in a sense they've got the organ, they can't see.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.400]   Their eye has been darkened.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:00.280]   A veil has come over it, there is this opacity, this dense condition, so that it can no longer
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.320]   receive the light that is coming from the outside.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:09.360]   Now, the state of men by nature and in sin is comparable to that.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.760]   You see, what that blind person needs is not a new eye.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:21.280]   What he needs is that the opacity, the veil, the mist, this thing that has developed into
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.000]   his lens, should be removed.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.320]   And then the moment that is removed, he can appreciate the light and he can see things
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.000]   as he did before.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.800]   Now that is the condition of men.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.240]   We have a natural understanding, men, as it were, has the faculty, the ability, but he
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.600]   can't use it.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.680]   It's blinded.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.680]   It's darkened.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.000]   This veil has come, the shatter has fallen.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.080]   And though there is that glorious light of God's revelation shining before us, by nature
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.920]   we don't see it.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:13:00.360]   And therefore it is necessary that this eye of our understanding should be enlightened,
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:06.840]   that the opacity, the veil, should be taken away in order that the eye may be enabled
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.720]   to see as hitherto.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.480]   As far as it goes, I think that illustration is all right, except perhaps that I ought
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.400]   to add this also, that as I understand the biblical teaching about these matters, the
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.240]   trouble with men is not only that his understanding has become darkened in that way, but because
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.080]   of that he does also need power itself.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   It is as if the eye, because of its not being used, becomes atrophied, and the very optic
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.900]   nerve itself, as it were, has lost its power of life, so that man needs a dual operation.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:53.300]   He needs the removal of the opacity and power and strength into his optic nerve, the eyes
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.040]   of your understanding being enlightened.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.620]   Now that is exactly what the Holy Spirit does for us.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.520]   And without this, I say, we are completely helpless.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.560]   I put it to you last Sunday morning.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.840]   I gave you illustrations of it, of men, great men of the world, men of great, massive intellect,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.480]   who are great statesmen in this country and so on, but when confronted by spiritual truth
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.080]   they saw nothing, because their understandings were darkened.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   It's no use taking a blind man and holding him before the most beautiful bit of scenery
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.720]   in the whole world, he just can't see it.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.360]   He may even say that there is no such scenery.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.560]   The trouble is, of course, that he can't see it, it's there.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.680]   Very well, I say, that this process is an absolute necessity, so the apostle is very
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   careful to repeat it.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:57.240]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.840]   Now the thing, obviously, for us to grasp this morning is that this is a prayer that
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.120]   he offers for Christian people.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.640]   He is not praying here for those who are in the world, he is praying for those of whom
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.200]   he has already said that they're in Christ Jesus, that they're fellow heirs with the
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.280]   saints, they've been sealed with the Holy Spirit, they've got love unto all the brethren
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   and so on.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:28.680]   And yet he prays that the eyes of their understandings may be enlightened, from which I deduce these
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:35.640]   principles, that as long as we are in this life and in this world, we shall always need
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.080]   the enlightening work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.960]   We never get into a position in which we no longer have such a need.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.320]   As long as we are here and encompassed by infirmities and in a world of sin, and indeed
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.760]   have a principle of sin still remaining in us, we need this enlightening operation of
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.480]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.440]   And surely we all know that by experience.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.920]   It doesn't matter how much you may have learned, how much understanding you may have
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.160]   of the scriptures.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.600]   If you begin to backslide in your life and living and practice, you will find that the
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.920]   word doesn't speak to you.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.600]   It's an invariable law.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.620]   One can never take a spiritual holiday.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.320]   You can never, as it were, go on living on a reserve which you've accumulated.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   No, no, this, like the manna, has got to be collected freshly day by day.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.760]   Unless one realizes one's dependence upon the Holy Spirit, the word won't speak.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.480]   If you read the word of God without praying for enlightenment, probably you'll get very
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   little out of it.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:59.680]   We must never depart from this consciousness of our dependence upon his power and his enlightenment.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.880]   That anointing that the Apostle John speaks of, that unction from the Holy One.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.900]   We need him constantly.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.320]   We need him increasingly.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.000]   Or I can put it in this form.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.040]   Spiritual knowledge is obviously progressive.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.720]   And here again, it seems to me, is another very vital principle.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.760]   These people knew a great deal already.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.460]   Paul thanks God for it.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.680]   And yet he says, "I want you to go on."
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.000]   Indeed, he keeps on repeating this.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.520]   You remember that great prayer in the third chapter where he prays very much for the same
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   thing.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.560]   That's what he's concerned about.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:48.100]   We are merely like children paddling at the very edge of a great and a mighty ocean.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.300]   There is nothing that is quite so tragic as the type of Christian who gives the impression
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.740]   that he's arrived.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.120]   And that is the danger always, of course, in thinking of the Christian life solely in
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.360]   terms of certain experiences.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.720]   You have your experience of forgiveness, you have your experience of sanctification, and
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.440]   you've arrived, you've finished.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.400]   You rest upon your experiences.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.800]   But the New Testament is entirely different from that.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.760]   Here rather the picture is of a progressive growth and development and increasing understanding.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.560]   You start as a babe in Christ, you begin to grow, you begin to garner knowledge, and it
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   goes on.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.660]   You think you know everything, and then something quite new suddenly opens before your gaze.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.080]   You go on learning from glory to glory, forgetting the things that are behind.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.400]   I press forward, says Paul, he's wanting to learn, to know, ever advancing.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.200]   That's the Christian life.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.100]   And therefore it seems to me it's a very good test of our whole Christian position
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.560]   this morning.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:02.480]   Is our spiritual knowledge greater today than it was a year ago, I wonder?
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.640]   Those who can look back across ten years in the Christian life, is your spiritual knowledge
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   greater?
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.840]   I'm not asking simply if you have a greater knowledge of the letter of the scripture.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.120]   I'm not asking if you've memorized more verses than you then do.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.120]   That's not what I'm asking.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.160]   I'm asking has your spiritual understanding grown?
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.960]   Is your grasp of truth more profound?
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.760]   Do you really feel that you're ever being led on from chamber to chamber in a great
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:38.280]   dimension, and that your total knowledge is correspondingly greater?
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.480]   That's the test.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.520]   Paul prayed that these people might ever have an increasingly greater spiritual knowledge
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.400]   and understanding of the truth.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:59.600]   And therefore my third principle is that we should constantly be praying for this ourselves.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   May I put that again in the form of a question?
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:12.280]   Do we day by day pray to God, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, to
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.880]   enlighten the eyes of our understanding?
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.080]   It should be our constant prayer.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.400]   We should seek this day by day.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.160]   We should seek it by reading the word, by praying for this enlightenment before we do
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   so.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:33.080]   It should be the constant endeavor of our lives that we might grow in grace and in the
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.400]   knowledge of the Lord.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.000]   Well now then, that is something clearly which is quite basic.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.520]   It's primary.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.320]   It is fundamental.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.920]   It seems to me that the trouble with most of us is that we've never awakened to this
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.040]   realization.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.780]   That we seem to think that we've arrived, that we know.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.400]   We know more than those liberals, those modernists, those people who are not Christians.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.320]   We seem to think that we have encompassed the whole of Christian truth.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:09.360]   My dear friends, we are batairos, we are babes, we are merely at the very beginning.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.960]   We must press on unto perfection.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   Are we interested in Christian doctrine?
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.160]   Do we rarely see the importance of Christian doctrine?
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.640]   Or do we find it rather boring and dull?
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.720]   Do we want always some excitement, something to entertain us?
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:33.040]   Do we realize that having been saved and called and placed in Christ, that what God wants
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.460]   us now to do is to grow in understanding of truth and of doctrine?
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.580]   That we should be more concerned now about this than anything else, that the eyes of
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:51.560]   our understanding, our comprehension, may be enlightened.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.600]   Very well given that, what is it that he wants us to know?
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.320]   And here I say we come to the first of these three things.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.560]   The first thing he wants us to know is what is the hope of his calling.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.120]   Now what does this great phrase mean?
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:19.680]   There has often been considerable dispute as to the meaning of the word hope here.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:28.160]   Some have tried to say that it means that we might know the things for which we do hope.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.240]   But surely it can't be that, because that is the thing that he deals with in his second
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.820]   petition, in his second what.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:41.520]   That is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.080]   So that we are judged that hope here does not mean the things hoped for.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.480]   Because it does mean that in scripture, but not here.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.880]   Well what does it mean here?
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.640]   Well surely here he is talking about our hope in and of itself.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:06.200]   He means here our realization that we have been called to those things and for those
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.680]   things.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:18.200]   In other words he is dealing again with this whole question of the assurance of our salvation.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.160]   Now that's the first word, the word hope.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.800]   And the other word we've got to look at obviously is this word calling.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.680]   That he may know what is the hope of his calling.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.080]   What does that mean exactly?
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.800]   Well of course the moment I mention this word calling, we are at once introduced into a
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.920]   great theological question and principle, a great matter of doctrine.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.760]   Now shall we test ourselves at this moment?
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.640]   I've been saying that nothing is more important than that the eyes of our understanding should
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   be enlightened.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.880]   I don't know my friend how long you've been a Christian.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.980]   You know that, but you've been a Christian let's say for a number of years.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.720]   What do you mean by this calling?
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.880]   What does the apostle mean when he talks about God's calling?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.440]   You and I are to know the hope of his calling.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.120]   What's it mean?
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.480]   What is God's calling?
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.280]   What is this calling to which he refers?
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.720]   Have you read the epistle to the Ephesians?
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.280]   Of course, many, many times.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.200]   But what's the calling?
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.240]   Ah, now then, here is a great New Testament term, a great doctrinal term, a term unfortunately
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.200]   that we hear very infrequently during these decadent days, but a term that once counted
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:46.960]   for so much, a great evangelical term, the calling of God.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:55.120]   The fathers used to teach, and rightly, that there are two calls.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.280]   There is a general call and there is a particular call.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.080]   For instance, you read in the seventeenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.720]   where the apostle is preaching to the Athenians something like this.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.260]   He says, "The times of this ignorance God winked at.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:19.260]   But now commendeth all men everywhere to repent."
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.920]   That is the general call.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:29.940]   The gospel of Jesus Christ issues a general call to all mankind to repent and to believe
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.920]   the gospel.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.320]   The gospel is to be preached to all creatures everywhere throughout the world.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.640]   They are to be called to repent and believe.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.280]   That's the general call.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:50.480]   But obviously and clearly the apostle cannot be referring to that here, because here he
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.840]   is not addressing a general letter to the world, he is addressing a special letter to
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.040]   Christian people, and he is offering a special prayer to those who have already believed
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.600]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.420]   Well clearly therefore there must be another type of calling, and very patently in the
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.760]   scripture there is.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:20.440]   There is a special call, or to use the actual term that the fathers used, there is an effectual
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.360]   call.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.040]   And you see the difference.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.160]   The general call of God is not always effectual.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.000]   There are many people who will go to hell who have heard the general call.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.720]   They could even tell you its terms.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.120]   There are men who are living in sin and gloating in it this morning who can tell you exactly
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.040]   what the gospel says.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.720]   They can describe to you what the call to repentance is and what the offer of the gospel
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   is.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   They know all about it.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   They've heard the call.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.960]   Yes, but they haven't responded to it.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.860]   It hasn't been effectual in their cases.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.040]   But there is a call which is effectual.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.560]   Now this is what the apostle puts so clearly in the 8th chapter of the epistle to the Romans
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.480]   in these words.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.920]   Listen.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.280]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:20.120]   To them who are the called according to his purpose.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.960]   All things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.400]   To them who are the called.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   Well that can't be the general call.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.480]   Because those who have heard it and have not responded do not love God.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.060]   They have not been called according to his purpose.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:42.920]   For this reason that those who have been called, it is true of them to say this also.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.120]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.760]   To them who are the called according to his purpose.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:56.040]   For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son that
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.280]   he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.080]   Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.960]   And whom he called, them he also justified.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.900]   And whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.360]   So you see that's a special calling.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.520]   The people who have been called in this sense have been justified and have been glorified.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.480]   But that isn't true of the unbeliever.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.920]   That isn't true of the men of the world who have been called to repent and to believe.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:33.880]   No, no, this isn't a general call, it's an effectual call, it's a special call.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.960]   In other words, it can be put like this.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:46.080]   God through the Gospel by the Holy Spirit sends out this general call to the whole world,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.560]   but then he calls in particular certain people.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.960]   And no man is a Christian unless he is called.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.200]   The called are the Christians, the Christians are the called.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.680]   These people in whom the Word of God has been made effective, it's been made powerful,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.360]   it has come as a command which they find irresistible, and they readily respond to it with the whole
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:14.280]   of their being, the called.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:21.960]   And therefore the Apostle's prayer is that we might know the hope of this calling.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.440]   You have been called, he says, with a heavenly calling in another place, you've been called
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:32.800]   with a holy calling, and what he wants us to know is the hope of this calling, the assurance
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.880]   of it, the certainty of it.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:44.480]   Now this is clearly something for which the Apostle prays for these Ephesians, and my
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.120]   dear friends, it is something for which you and I should pray.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.840]   It's one of the most practical things that I know of in the Christian life.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.960]   Have you got assurance of your salvation?
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:05.440]   Have you made, to use the words of Peter, your calling and election sure?
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.320]   It's the whole secret of a happy Christian life.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.760]   The enemy attacks, the devil is there with his doubts and uncertainties, sin troubles
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.120]   us and makes us think that perhaps we've never been a Christian at all, are you certain
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.320]   of the hope of your calling?
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.680]   This is the very essence of the very essence of the Protestant and the evangelical position.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.160]   The Roman Catholics dislike the doctrine of assurance of salvation, they abominate it,
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.080]   they denounce it.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.400]   You see, they don't want us to be certain, our certainty must be in the church, we commit
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.640]   ourselves to the church for that sort of thing.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.000]   Not only that, we have to go through purgatory, they say.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.200]   The whole thing is uncertain, and it all depends upon the church and the prayers of the church
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.760]   for us and the lighting of candles and the prayers, the supererogation of the saints,
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:03.320]   my whole position is uncertain and precarious.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.920]   But the essence of Protestantism as Martin Luther discovered to his great and eternal
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:15.400]   joy is this, that the individual Christian may know for certain and he may defy all devils
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.120]   and hell and Satan himself.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:27.880]   He knows in whom he has believed, his hope is sure, his calling and his election is sure.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:34.320]   Very well then, this is something, my friends, which you and I should possess.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:40.480]   The Roman Catholics, I say, don't like it, and certain modern schools of theology don't
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.440]   like it.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.840]   There is this so-called Barthian school that looks so much like the evangelical school,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:52.040]   but which is radically different, and for this reason, again, it denounces assurance.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.960]   It says the Christian never can be sure.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.400]   It dislikes the whole conception.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.280]   But according to the prayer of the Apostle, a Christian should know the hope of his calling.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.760]   He should be absolutely certain about it.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   How can he be?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   Well, he must have the eyes of his understanding enlightened before he can get this.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   Well how does he get it?
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.440]   We've already seen part of the answer in the whole doctrine of the sealing of the Spirit.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.000]   The purpose of the sealing of the Spirit, we saw when we were discussing together verse
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.920]   13, was that we might have this assurance.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.960]   But it isn't only that.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.760]   You see, if it were only that, the Apostle would not be praying like this for these Ephesians.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.800]   He'd say, "I thank God you've got your assurance, you've been sealed with the Spirit,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   and you need nothing more."
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   No, no.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.880]   He'd say, "I know you've got that, but I still pray that the eyes of your understanding
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.280]   may be enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of your calling, his calling,
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.160]   of you."
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   What is the distinction then?
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.720]   Well, I'd put it like this.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   The sealing of the Spirit, as we saw, is mainly subjective.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.680]   It is something which happens in the realm of experience and which, in a sense, cannot
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.880]   be stated in words.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:17.960]   But it is the Spirit bearing witness with my spirit directly, that I am a child of God.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   Subjective.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.920]   Thank God for it.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:27.680]   Yes, but it's not the only grounds of assurance, and thank God it isn't.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.600]   And I say thank God it isn't for this reason.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:38.400]   That if we are going to rely only upon the subjective, we may find ourselves one day
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.000]   in a state of great doubt.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.840]   You may have had the sealing with the Spirit, and yet as the result of falling into sin
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.080]   or circumstances or illness or some feebleness in your flesh, or something like that, the
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.440]   devil may so bombard you, he's like a roaring lion, he may come and attack you, he may shake
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:04.680]   your whole universe, and you may say, "That must have been a false experience that I had.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   I must have been deluding myself."
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.500]   If you rely only on the subjective, you may find yourself in a state of great and grievous
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.900]   misery.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:19.720]   That is why the Apostle goes on to pray that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:26.360]   that we may have a further grounds of assurance and a further certainty of our whole position.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.760]   And you notice that this is something objective?
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.840]   It's the eyes of your understanding that must be enlightened to receive this.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.160]   This is something that comes to your mind and then works through your whole being.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.520]   It's not theoretical as I said, but it starts with the mind, it is essentially a matter
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.120]   of understanding, the understanding is no longer darkened, we are alive to spiritual
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   truth.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.280]   Very well, then, this is a grounds of assurance and of certainty that comes with an understanding
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.280]   of God's truth.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:06.200]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened by the unction of the Holy Ghost.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   What does it lead to?
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.880]   Let me just note it.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:18.840]   The first ingredient, the first essential in this assurance, this hope is that we should
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.360]   come to a deeper and a greater knowledge of the God who has called us.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.760]   You notice the Apostle is very careful to say that we may know what is the hope of his
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.160]   calling.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.080]   It's God who calls and you and I are enjoying God's calling this morning.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.480]   Well, very well, then, if I want to have the sure hope, if I want to have certainty, the
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.240]   thing I must go for is a knowledge of God, the one who does the calling.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   What do I know?
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.280]   This.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.920]   There is nothing that gives me greater hope and assurance this morning than my knowledge
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.200]   of the character of God.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:09.500]   I dare not trust my sweetest frame because they are so changeable, but I can rely upon
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.240]   him, the character of God.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:20.200]   God is eternal, God is immutable, God is everlasting.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:28.840]   God never changes his purposes, I know of no greater comfort than that.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.200]   God never starts a work and then gives it up.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.080]   You and I do.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:42.040]   We become excited and enthusiastic and keen and we are going to move the whole world and
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.240]   others look on at us and say, "Well, that's marvellous, that's wonderful, I've done
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240]   nothing at all.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   Look at that person."
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.380]   He's not the same person in six months, he's given it up.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:59.600]   Lost heart, lost interest, become slack and formal again, but God isn't like that.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:06.840]   God is everlastingly the same, he is the father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.640]   shadow of turning.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.120]   Is there a greater comfort than that?
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.640]   It's God who's called me and he's like that, that's the God.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   And then his covenant.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   My whole position this morning rests in God's covenant.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.040]   What's the covenant?
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.080]   Well, you see, you must have the eyes of your understanding enlightened before you know
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.820]   anything about the covenant.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:44.960]   God has made a covenant, a covenant of redemption, a covenant of salvation.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:53.440]   He made it with his own Son before the very foundation of the world.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.520]   And it's an everlasting covenant.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.240]   God is Jehovah, the covenant-keeping God.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:08.040]   I am what I am and I will never change nor vary, the covenant of God.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.440]   He has given his people to his Son.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.960]   He has covenanted to redeem them, and the Son has entered into the covenant.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.180]   The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the new humanity, he's our representative, he's
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:30.680]   our federal head, and there we are represented by him, the covenant between Father and Son,
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:38.600]   an everlasting covenant, repeated to men, promised to Adam, repeated to Abraham, again
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.160]   repeated to Moses, repeated to David, the covenant of God.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:53.960]   Read it, understand it, study it in the Scriptures, there's the ground of assurance of salvation.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.560]   And then over and above that we have that great thing of which we were reminded in that
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.720]   sixth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews at the beginning.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.160]   God has even taken an oath in this matter.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.080]   He needn't have done so, but he did so deliberately to Abraham.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.340]   He confirmed his promise with an oath.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.520]   He swore by himself.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.680]   He couldn't think of anything greater or anyone greater.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:33.600]   So God has confirmed his covenant and his promise by taking an oath.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:39.280]   God has sworn by himself that he will do this thing.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:45.040]   He's underwritten it, he's pledged it, he's made it absolutely certain and inviolable,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.440]   the oath of God.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   Have you studied it in the Word?
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.120]   Have you spent your time in meditating upon it?
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.160]   You Hebrew Christians, says the author of that epistle, you've been very diligently,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.000]   ministering unto the saints, you're a very good and a kind people, I agree with you,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.480]   but he says I would, that you would put the same diligence unto the full assurance of
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:18.000]   hope right unto the end, go back to the covenant, study the oath of God, realize its relevance
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.560]   to you, be enlightened about this matter, that's the way to make the hope sure.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:33.040]   And then the power of God, I don't stay with this this morning because the apostle
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:39.440]   goes on to deal with it in particular in his third great petition here, that we can be
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:45.560]   certain of this, that nothing can prevent God's purpose, nothing can withstand God's
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:52.600]   plan, it's absolutely certain and the power of Almighty God is behind it, the character
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.320]   of God.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:03.440]   But then another thing which is very vital for us in this respect is this, that we must
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:11.240]   realize that the call of God is a part of his plan, and that it is a whole plan and
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:18.160]   a complete plan, that God sees the plan as a whole and therefore if we are in the plan
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.360]   at all, the ultimate is absolutely certain for us.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:28.920]   Now go back again to that 8th of Romans, which is a great exposition of this text.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:35.600]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:43.200]   the called according to his purpose, now listen to the logic, for whom he did foreknow he
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.800]   also did predestine it to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.360]   firstborn amongst many brethren, moreover whom he did predestine it then he also called
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:01.600]   and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.760]   What shall we then say to these things?
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:12.440]   And here's the answer, if God be for us, if that God be for us, who can be against
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:20.400]   us, there's the certainty, there is this blessed hope.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.120]   In other words if I have been called effectually I am called to the end, if I'm called in
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.960]   the mind of God I'm already glorified, it's as certain as that.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.720]   When God starts he always finishes, he hath begun a good work and he will perform it until
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:43.160]   the day of Christ, nothing can stop it, the covenant is one, the plan is one, and if there
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:51.560]   is one link all the links will follow, no one shall pluck them out of my hands.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.680]   Are you clear about that my friend?
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.360]   Do you go frequently to the 8th of Romans and do you read it and pray over it and say
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:05.960]   this is true of me, I've been called therefore I'm justified, therefore I'm glorified
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.280]   in Christ, the thing is certain and it's sure, do you answer the devil when he attacks
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.160]   you with these scriptures, that's what the Lord did, he had the enlightenment, he answered
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.040]   him with scriptures.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:24.440]   And that is what is meant by having the eyes of our understanding enlightened.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:32.200]   And the last thing I would say therefore is this, we need to understand the doctrine truly
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:39.520]   as to what has already happened to us.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.000]   There is no greater comfort, no greater grounds of assurance than the doctrine of the rebirth
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.720]   and of regeneration.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:58.040]   If I am born of God and of the Spirit I cannot fall away, it's impossible.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   There is no such thing as falling from grace.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.760]   Do you ask me to believe that the eternal God should implant in you this seed of eternal
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:13.680]   life and allow anything to destroy it?
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.400]   Or the monstrous idea that you can be born again one day and then sin and lose it and
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.720]   then be born again and go back and forth, my dear friends it's ignorance that speaks
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.720]   like that.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:31.640]   The eyes of the understanding of such people have not been enlightened.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:38.080]   According to this teaching if I am a Christian at all I am in Christ.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:46.440]   I am united to Christ, I am joined to Christ, as I was in Adam I am in Christ, I am bound
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.000]   to him by indissoluble links.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.760]   Do we understand that?
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.840]   Because if we do understand it our hope shall be very certain and very sure.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.940]   You can't be in and out of Christ.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.360]   You can't be in Christ one day and out of Christ the next.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.320]   You can't be in Christ and then never go out of Christ.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:15.680]   You are either in to all eternity or out to all eternity.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:23.600]   That is why, you see, we need to have the eyes of our understanding enlightened.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:29.020]   We must see and know this doctrine of our blessed mystical union with Christ.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:33.360]   He the head, Paul is going to elaborate it at the end of this chapter, he is the head
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.100]   and we are the body, we are in him and belong to him and are joined to him.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:44.000]   My dear friends, I ask again, do these things mean everything to you?
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.400]   That's the test of our spirituality.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.320]   That's the test of our growth in grace.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.160]   Paul says, "You Ephesians, you are born again."
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.360]   But do you know these things?
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.360]   Are you sure?
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.960]   Are you apprehending these things increasingly?
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:05.720]   Well, as I close, shall I put my test in this form?
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.840]   Can we use this sort of language?
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.920]   My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:28.880]   I dare not trust my sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:39.640]   When darkness seems to veil his face, and that does happen, darkness seems to veil his
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   face.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.560]   There are times when you don't seem to be able to find him, are there not?
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.920]   And you look for him and you search for him, as you can read it all in the song of Solomon,
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.760]   the saints have always testified to this, the heavens are sometimes like brass, you
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.880]   don't seem to be able to make contact.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:08.620]   When darkness seems to veil his face, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:12.160]   I can't see him, but I know that he's unchanging.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.160]   I can't see the sun, the clouds are there, but I know the sun is there.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.480]   I don't rely upon my being able to see the sun, I know it's there.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:28.760]   When darkness seems to veil his face, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:38.200]   In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:49.480]   His oath, his covenant, his blood, support me in the whelming flood, when all around
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:48:00.440]   my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:11.960]   In Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:17.480]   Do you know the hope of your calling?
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.160]   Have you made your calling and election sure?
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:28.040]   Are you resting upon his oath, his covenant, his blood, his unchangeableness, whether you
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.280]   see him or not, whether you feel or not?
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:39.840]   Are you able to rest upon the truth concerning him, which in his grace he has revealed to
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:46.560]   us in his word by the Holy Spirit, and which he enables us to grasp and to apprehend by
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.280]   enlightening the eyes of our understanding.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.760]   Seek it, you're meant to rejoice, you're meant to have a sure and a steadfast hope
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:05.560]   that nothing can shake, and it is for you in this way, amen.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
