[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   Some people may assume that John Piper was born a Calvinist. In fact, no, he wasn't. His embrace of reformed
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.720]   soteriology came at the expense of some very painful life experiences,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.100]   some of which he shared in a
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.680]   2002 sermon. Here's Pastor John explaining one of those key moments from his life in seminary,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.920]   when he came face to face with Philippians 2.12 and
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.760]   the ninth chapter of Romans.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.380]   Here he is to explain.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.580]   There are two experiences in my life
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.800]   that
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   make Romans 9
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.040]   one of the most important,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.440]   if not the most important chapter in
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.120]   the Bible in shaping the way I think about everything and
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.840]   in determining where I have been led by God to minister, namely at Bethlehem.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.400]   And the reason I open in this
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.840]   autobiographical way is
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.680]   not because it really matters what happened to me. It really is neither here nor there
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.080]   what I think about anything or what I experienced about anything. I tell it autobiographically because
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.880]   the doctrines of Romans 9 are about life.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.560]   They're about choices that you will make behind which you will never turn again.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   You come to certain points in your life in crisis, and you know that if you cross the line, you'll never go back again.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.280]   And you need to know that that's what we're dealing with in Romans 9. This is not just about controversy. This is not just about
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.880]   intellectual thought. It's not just about doctrine. It's about what will happen to your life
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.160]   because of a vision of God and a vision of salvation that's in this chapter.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.120]   When I entered seminary
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.080]   in 1968, I
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.600]   believed in the freedom of my will in the sense that I thought it was ultimately
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.840]   self-determining.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.320]   I hadn't learned that from the Bible.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.240]   I had absorbed that from the
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.720]   self-infatuated,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.400]   self-exalting,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.840]   self-esteeming,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.380]   self-sufficient air you and I breathe in this country every day.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.240]   That's where I had absorbed it.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.840]   It isn't in the Bible. Not one verse teaches the self-determining will of man.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.560]   But I believed it just like most people believe it.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.260]   The sovereignty of God meant to me he can do anything with me. I give him permission to do.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.840]   That's what the sovereignty of God meant.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   And with this frame of mind, I entered a class on Philippians taught by Daniel Fuller and I entered a class on
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   the salvation of man taught by James Morgan who died of cancer while I was at Fuller.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.440]   In Philippians,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.240]   I hit head-on,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.760]   verse 12, chapter 2,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.000]   "Work out your salvation
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.440]   with fear and trembling." And then I hit like a brick wall the ground clause,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.960]   "For
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.640]   God is that one who is at work in you to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.040]   Beneath my willing is God's willing and beneath my working is
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.000]   God's
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.800]   working." The question wasn't, "Do I have a will?"
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.040]   The question was, "Why do I will what I will?"
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.800]   And the ultimate answer,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.340]   not the only answer, was God.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.240]   Then I entered this systematic theology class with
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.280]   James Morgan.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.760]   We dealt, as all systematic theology classes do, with the doctrine of election and
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   grace.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.480]   Romans 9 proved to be the watershed text in that class. I
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.400]   ran into these verses in
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.840]   chapter 9, verse 11,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.640]   "Though Jacob and Esau were not yet born and
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.680]   had not done anything good or bad,
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.320]   in order that the purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of him who calls,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.960]   she was told, Rebecca was told, the older will serve the younger,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.880]   before they done anything good or evil,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.120]   in order that election might stand,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.600]   Esau was made subservient
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.160]   to Jacob." And it raises the question of the justice of God. And therefore in verse 14,
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.560]   we read in that class, and you can read right now in your Bible, "Is there then injustice on God's part?"
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.800]   And he answers, "No," and he quotes Moses.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.920]   Verse 15, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:29.880]   Which raises the question of his irresistible will, which Paul raises in verse 19, "Why then does he still find fault?
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   Who can resist his will?"
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   And he answers in verse 21,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.320]   "Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.120]   dishonorable use?"
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.400]   Now,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   emotions run very high
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   in a
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.040]   22 year old or 82 year old who finds his
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.000]   man-centered world collapsing around him.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.800]   So,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.120]   one day I met James Morgan in the hall
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.360]   who was confronting me with these texts that were making me very angry and
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.240]   making me cry in the afternoon as I read my Bible.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.760]   And I pulled my pen out of my pocket, and I stood in front of him and after a few minutes of heated discussion, I
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.440]   held my pen in front of his face and
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.280]   I dropped it on the floor.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.880]   And with far less respect than a 22 year old ought to have for a teacher, I said,
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.440]   "I dropped it!
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   I dropped it!"
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.000]   As though that would settle the issue.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.680]   That there were no
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.640]   divine
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.500]   authority or power that might have somehow governed my dropping it.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.800]   Emotions run very high when your world is collapsing. By the end of the semester it was in
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.440]   ruins.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.920]   And I wrote in my blue book, I can picture the place in the class where I was sitting,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.720]   "Romans 9 is like a tiger
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.960]   going about devouring
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.080]   free-willers like me." And that was the end of my love affair
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.960]   with human autonomy and the ultimate self-determination of my will.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.600]   And it was the beginning of
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.080]   a love affair with the supremacy of God.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.960]   That was from Pastor John's sermon delivered on November 3rd,
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.620]   2002, aptly titled, "The Absolute Sovereignty of God.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.880]   What is Romans 9 about?" You can find the full sermon at ZyronGod.org.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.400]   And of course, John Piper on Romans 9 is gold. A number of people are unaware
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.520]   that he published a whole academic book on this chapter in
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:13.280]   1993. It's a book titled, "The Justification of God." If you have some Greek in you, you should check that out.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.320]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John's in a recent message or an old message,
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   conference message, something you heard him share locally in your hometown,
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:30.160]   whatever, give me the timestamps of the audio clip of when it begins and ends. Tell me why that clip impacted you and
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.680]   email me those details at askpastorjohn@zyrongod.org. That's an email address, askpastorjohn@zyrongod.org.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:44.200]   Give me your name, your hometown, or the city you live closest to, and put the word "clip" in the subject line as well.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:52.000]   I'm always interested to hear which sermons have most impacted you, and specifically which clips from those sermons have been most impactful.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.160]   And I would love to share those with the whole audience.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:05.280]   Well, next time we ask, "Is angry prayer okay?" It's an important question that we need to address. Is angry prayer okay?
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.160]   Don't miss it. I'm Tony Renke. We'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   [END]
