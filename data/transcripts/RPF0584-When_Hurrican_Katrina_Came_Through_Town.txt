[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.960]   host and today we continue our series related to National Preparedness Month in honor of
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.400]   September, which is officially here in the United States, the National Preparedness Month.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.200]   And today I'm going to share with you the experiences of one man as he went through
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.240]   Hurricane Katrina more than 10 years ago. A couple minutes of preamble here before I
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.360]   read this particular man's experiences. Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.600]   in our modern era in terms of loss of life, impact, etc. It was absolutely awful. But
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.800]   what often happens is it's hard to get the stories of people who were involved in it
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.560]   up close. And Hurricane Katrina was unique in the length of the devastation. With most
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.080]   hurricanes, most natural disasters, their effects are relatively localized. And very
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.000]   quickly after a disaster, other first responders, other companies can come in after the fact
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.140]   and get things put together pretty quickly. And then, of course, we all go on and we forget
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.120]   about the people whose houses blew away or whose property burned up, etc. And those stories
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.280]   are just kind of lost to the next drama of the day. But Katrina was different. It was
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.400]   unique in the way that the circumstances of the disaster unfolded. And it was a very long
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.360]   disaster. It was a very long time. And especially as relates to things like the physical violence
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.640]   that happened, the loss of life, the looting, just the interactions with people. It was
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.100]   a really, really bad disaster. And a number of years ago, I came across this account in
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.760]   an online forum. It comes from a, I guess, kind of a prepper survivalist forum called
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.040]   zombie hunters.org. I'll link to it in the show notes for today's show. You can read
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.960]   it yourself if you would like. But this particular experience was written in March of 2007 by
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.080]   a man whose screen name is Raptor. And I am going to read it to you, including some of
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.780]   the follow-up discussion, because it's extremely well-written and it gives a firsthand account
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.440]   of somebody who was in it. The unique thing about this particular man's experience is
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.560]   his level of preparation and his wealth. And I want you to see how, because he wasn't destitute,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.180]   he weathered the storm much more successfully than many other people. But even so, look
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.600]   at how, as I read his examples and I read his stories, look at how helpful his money
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.120]   was to him in this circumstance and how he was able to use and deploy that money in the
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.700]   furtherance of his own business, in the protection and care for his own family, and in the care
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.200]   for his neighbors and friends. It's an excellent account of somebody who was thoughtful and
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.240]   was prepared and it shows how money and physical preparations come together. Now, you should
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.440]   know that some things have changed in the last more than 10 years since Hurricane Katrina.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.720]   Some of the technology references and such that he mentions are a little bit out of date.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.680]   The technology has changed. Some of the circumstances have changed, etc. I previously recorded a
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.640]   version of this show where I gave extensive commentary trying to give up-to-date information
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   on this, but it became so cumbersome that I've decided to delete that and now I will
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.600]   just simply read you his experiences without my commentary. One more bit of preamble. Take
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.960]   note of what he shares and consider what you would do in your own life. Don't try to just
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.600]   simply say, "Well, I've got to freak out and do all these things that he did or do all
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   these things that he suggests." Very rarely when you listen to an account as extensive
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.200]   as this will you be able to do all of these things, but there are two responses that I
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.560]   would recommend that you have. Number one, if there is something that Raptor talks about
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   that you come to realize is deficient in your own planning or in your own thinking, think
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.660]   of something simple that you can do to take action so that that deficiency is corrected.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.840]   Number two, think about what you would do if you were facing circumstances like this
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.400]   so that prior to you ever facing them you've thought about what it would be like. One of
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.720]   the most valuable things you can do is when watching the world, consider the circumstances
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.840]   that other people are going through and then formulate your own ideas on responding to
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.780]   them. Even if you do nothing actually in terms of action, that process of thinking through
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.260]   and wargaming the scenario will help you to be prepared for such eventualities happening
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.460]   to you and will hopefully put you in a position where should you face such a circumstance
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.480]   in the future, you can sit back and you can make decisions more quickly. You can be less
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.940]   likely to be overwhelmed by the stress of the moment and to freeze up and more likely
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.860]   to sit down, think and face the facts hard on and make better decisions. I want to remind
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.940]   you that this account is a true account of people who are on the ground. Of course, I
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.220]   can't verify it intensely, but I have no reason to want to. There's no reason why I see that
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.300]   this person would lie about these circumstances. Rather, this is an anonymous posting, so of
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.020]   course we can't actually verify it, but I see no reason to doubt this account. This
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.860]   is an unfiltered account of one man's experiences in the middle of a horrible and devastating
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.940]   circumstance and the lessons he learned from it.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.340]   We go to Raptor now with his story.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.060]   I live in a suburb of New Orleans called Metairie. Parts of it were flooded briefly, though a
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.580]   small portion was flooded due to the 17th Street Canal failure for about two weeks.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.300]   My home was not flooded and sustained relatively minor damage. I evacuated my family, including
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.340]   our pets, to Atlanta on Sunday at noon after making sure other people I know, including
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.980]   employees, had left and did not need transport. I thought I was the last one out as everyone
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.760]   I knew told me they were long gone. I listened to the mayor order a mandatory evacuation
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.220]   of the city as I passed Slidell, about 30 miles east of the city. My wife was behind
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.620]   me in another vehicle the whole way, frustrated that she had to leave. The whole world was
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.980]   going west to Houston. I decided at the last minute to head east, into the storm's projected
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.020]   route to avoid the traffic, since I calculated I had only 18 hours to escape. I did not want
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.180]   to risk being on the road for this storm.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.080]   As it turned out, we made a great decision because the traffic was mainly headed west.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.660]   We momentarily slowed down to 50 mph on parts of the I-10 highway, but for the most part
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.900]   I did not slow down to under 80 mph until we were past the Contra Flow area, about 25
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.380]   miles north of the coastline on I-59. We picked the right window and the right direction for
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.980]   our quick escape. We spent the night in Birmingham after a 6-hour drive (we were tired and emotionally
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.180]   spent) and drove with a heavy heart to Atlanta the next morning. I got us settled into a
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.820]   hotel near a relative's home. I then told my wife to go find two furnished corporate
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.500]   apartments for us. We knew we were going to be in Atlanta a while. She asked how long
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.140]   (she always assumes I have the answer to everything). I said maybe permanently from the looks of
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.900]   things, which really angered her.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.900]   We wait until the last minute to evacuate due to the reluctance of both my wife and
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.180]   mother to leave. My house is an older home built of concrete block and stucco. It has
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.180]   hurricane shutters, a 30 kW diesel generator with 300 gallons of fuel, and is on a relatively
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.900]   high ground (about 5 feet above sea level). I have always stockpiled food (shelf stable
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.020]   and MREs), water, firearms, ammunition, medical supplies, and basic disaster supplies, and
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.900]   I consider myself reasonably prepared. I also keep a small boat in the garage.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.500]   I shut down my business on Friday at noon after we completed our much-tested hurricane
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.860]   backup plan. I sent everyone home early and told them to contact me Saturday and Sunday
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.580]   if they decided to evacuate. I told them we would regroup Monday or Tuesday. My usual
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.380]   hurricane rule was enforced for my employees. That is, you will not be penalized in any
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.380]   way if you miss work for one or two days due to an evacuation. Little did I know that it
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.140]   would be three weeks before we would gather as even a partial group again.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.820]   I gave a two-week pay advance to everyone before they left, telling everyone to be safe
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.860]   but to communicate with me. I normally do not do this, but since payday was next Friday
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.180]   and Katrina had me spooked, I did it. This two-week's pay helped some lower-paid employees
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.580]   evacuate to safety. I kept everyone on the payroll and forgave the two-week pay advance
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.460]   for all. I did this to retain everybody, and I was not disappointed by anybody. Most were
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:26.020]   moved and some moved to tears when we met again and regrouped. Work provided some normalcy
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.740]   and security during these dark days.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:37.460]   Katrina of course hit, and you know the story. Carnage, looting, flooding, death, etc. Around
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.860]   Wednesday after Katrina, I was going crazy with worry. My employees had not all checked
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:48.020]   in. Our office had no communications. The whole 504 area code was down. Property was
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.100]   obviously in need of attention, and I was concerned about the business. I decided to
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.740]   go back and deal with the issues. I left my family back in Atlanta and went back alone.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.260]   I got to my home, despite the fact that the city and parish were sealed off. I know the
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.940]   city well, and I knew it could not be sealed off. I got through unchallenged. The flooding
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.500]   and most of Jefferson Parish had been pumped out by then. Upon arriving home, I cranked
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:19.180]   up the generator, and I had power, HVAC, internet, landline, telephone. I could dial out, but
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.140]   no one could dial in. I neglected to empty the refrigerator when I left, so I did have
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.740]   that mess to clean up. That is a particularly nasty job, but a large thick garbage bag,
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.580]   gas mask, and chemical gloves make the job easy.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.440]   Once home, I assessed the damage and secured what little damage was done. The wind caused
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.940]   little damage to the entire city. The flooding is what caused the bulk of the damage. I fixed
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.580]   what I could, and then went out to check on other people's property. I sent digital
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.180]   photos via the internet to my wife in Atlanta, who contacted and forwarded the pictures.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.560]   I found out some friends from Lafayette, Louisiana were coming down to the city on rescue parties
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.920]   by boat the next day. They were turned away for some obscure reason and stopped by my
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.220]   house to check on me. They agreed to stay a few days to help out our friends. That began
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:12.000]   the role I played for several friends, being the forward staging area for friends and business
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.700]   associates trying to get back to their businesses.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.460]   The generator made life comfortable, but it burned copious amounts of fuel. My 300 gallon
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:27.940]   supply was supposed to last 10-12 days, but 300 gallons was only a 7 day supply. I had
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:34.040]   to drive to Baton Rouge with empty drums to buy diesel. Gasoline was in very short supply,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.340]   but diesel was non-existent for civilians for about a week. I had plenty of natural
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.500]   gas for the grill, seafood broiler, water heater, and dryer, but it was useless for
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:49.100]   the generator. I have since added a smaller, 15 kW air-cooled gas-powered generator to
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.620]   supplement the diesel-powered set. The diesel ran like a champ, though, for 3 weeks straight,
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:00.660]   about 500 hours. I stopped it twice a day to check the oil and coolant levels. I changed
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:07.440]   the oil and filter only once after 200 hours. I had neglected the oil and filter stockpile
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.460]   and had enough for only one filter change. I also had trouble finding the right oil and
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:18.140]   filter for about 4 weeks, so I ran it with dirty oil.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:23.820]   I made many forays into the city with friends and family. Some were clandestine, and others
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:31.900]   were overt and authorized. I passed looters actively looting stores and was shot at on
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:38.640]   at least one occasion. I will never forget one trip I made. I hired 9 off-duty police
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   officers to go with me into a flooded area and check on my property. This officer was
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.900]   an acquaintance and a true blue cop, a real Joe Friday. However, before we left, he said,
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   "Now, if something happens and we shoot someone, we're just going to keep going and not stop,
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.900]   okay? Do you understand what I'm saying?" The three things I remember most about the
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.020]   time was the oppressive heat and sun during the day, and pitch-black nights and the chaos
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.600]   and uncertainty of the whole situation. The following is my list of what worked and did
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.500]   not work.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.340]   Communications. Text messaging worked well all through the worst of the incident. The
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.060]   messages were often delayed, but they got through eventually. A BlackBerry proved to
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.980]   be a valuable and useful means to communicate. A pager also worked, but was only a one-way
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.620]   system. The text message interface on a PC also worked great, assuming you have internet
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.980]   service.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.580]   A cell phone with a different area code was invaluable. I bought a prepaid cell phone
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:48.520]   in Atlanta. The Singular system was dysfunctional, but Verizon and Sprint did work. I used Singular
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.900]   and Virgin Mobile, which is a Sprint reseller. The cell phone with a different area code
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.020]   allowed you to dial out and to receive calls. Forward your key telephone numbers to this
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:04.540]   cell and you can remain in communication. The entire 504 area code was unusable for
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:10.340]   about 30 days. We forwarded our phones before we left, but the entire network, including
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.940]   call forwarding, went down. So all of our phones just rang, or you received an out-of-service
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.860]   message, which is not good for business.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:25.320]   CB and FMRS radios were useless in the city due to significant range limitations. Around
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.740]   the house, a cordless phone with a paging and intercom function worked better than the
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:36.100]   FMRS radio, since it would ring when you were wanted. I would carry the cordless phone and
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.740]   use the intercom function.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.940]   Marine VHF was useful for local area communication, though it is strictly illegal to use it for
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.920]   this purpose. A 12 volt VHF unit on a boat in the driveway is good for about a mile to
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.740]   handheld sets. Though handheld sets could get through to the base station at this distance
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.900]   only if you could see the other person. They could also be used in the car on the highway
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.700]   and were useful since the channels are not much in use inland and the squelch function
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:07.460]   is useful. Be sure to get the VHF units with the ability to use alkaline batteries.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.500]   Telephone landlines worked well, and in non-flooded areas the telephone landlines never went down.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:18.500]   Cable was not robust and went down early and stayed down for a very long time. DSL, since
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.160]   it uses landlines, did not go down at all. Satellite dishes were blown away and like
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.700]   cable were inoperative. The internet was invaluable.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.660]   I set up a routine check-in time for all parties with someone outside of the city. I surfaced
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.480]   to communicate and check in at 9am, noon, and 6pm to communicate with my wife while
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.660]   she was in Atlanta.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.140]   Keep your cell phone batteries charged, so have a car adapter, 110 volt adapter, AA adapter,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.160]   and spare batteries. Anytime you see a place to charge them, charge them up. Keeping these
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.340]   items charged will be a pain in the neck.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:59.080]   A TV made a poor news machine at first. AM and FM radios worked well. The internet was
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.980]   more comprehensive but had a several hour lag time. A spare satellite dish had dish
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:10.860]   TV back up and working in no time. A spare dish also had satellite internet up and operating.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:16.660]   I recommend satellite TV and internet as long as you have a spare dish.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:22.420]   Lighting - Darkness, darkness, and more darkness. Post-disaster streetlights will not work,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.740]   and the place will be incredibly dark. When there was no moon, the darkness was surreal.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.820]   Park your cars so that their headlights shine on likely areas of egress to your house or
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.820]   the place you are visiting. Use the remote fob switch to make the headlights and backup
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.500]   lights go on in the event you hear someone outside. You can also use the car panic switch
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:49.940]   to set off the horn for a distraction. Use a car battery booster with a 12v to 110v
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:55.380]   inverter to plug in a 110v area light to provide some area lighting if your generator is not
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:03.500]   operational. Use floodlights sparingly. They attract too much attention in a dark city.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.820]   Spotlights with rechargeable batteries were less useful than those which took D-cell batteries.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.940]   The charges could not be relied upon when you needed them, and recharging them once
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:22.860]   depleted was a pain in the neck. A 12v corded spotlight is cheaper and more reliable. Note
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.580]   that they can also be plugged into the battery booster. Attempt to create appearance of many
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:33.260]   more people than you have. A group of 6-10 is more likely to thrive than a small group.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:39.140]   A person alone is in great danger and should consider leaving.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.020]   Spotlights are not useful for area lighting, regardless of size and type. Lanterns are
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.820]   much more useful for area lighting. LED and fluorescent are great inside, but Coleman
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:54.060]   double mantle lanterns dual fuel are great outdoors, but only outdoors. I buy only D-cell,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:59.620]   AA, and/or AAA to simplify inventory needs. Avoid candles and hurricane lamps. The light
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:05.260]   is poor for candles and both bring heat and more importantly fire risk into the house.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.140]   Full open flame of any kind should be kept only outside.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.940]   Keep a low profile. Be able to establish your bona fides with a picture ID with your company
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.060]   name and address of work, as well as a letter on corporate letterhead, notarized with a
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.080]   corporate seal on it. A white pickup truck with a corporate logo and people inside dressed
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.880]   in personal protective equipment will be the key to transportation. Make sure it has a
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.140]   sign on it. Magnetic signs with business name work well.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.200]   Impersonating a responder is illegal, but impersonating a business is not. Use the term
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.320]   safety guy or personnel guy. These folks are always in and out, and nobody either hates
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.740]   them or really needs them, so you will not get drafted by the locals. Do not, I repeat,
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.960]   do not say you are an insurance adjuster or in the insurance business, even if you are.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.860]   You will be taking your life into your own hands. Seriously. They're considered equal
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.360]   to child molesters.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.280]   Personal Morale and Stress
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.320]   Morale is vital to all on scene. Cleaning yourself up and putting on clean clothes is
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.000]   a good morale booster. Washing clothes is a pain, but it is important to have clean
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.580]   clothes available, even if you have to do it by hand. As long as the water from the
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.840]   tap is clear and not murky, cloudy, or odiferous, you can use it to clean clothes in an electric
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:30.360]   washing machine, assuming you have a generator. If you are the leader, act like one. Express
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.960]   concern about your people, whether you actually do care about them or not. They must think
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.840]   you care about them and will help them. It helps if you're sincere, but even if you're
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.840]   not, pretend to be sincere. Your life may depend on it.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:50.280]   Get lots of rest at night. The night is the worst part. It will be very, very dark, which
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.680]   to city dwellers can be scary and disorienting. Sleep is the best way to handle this problem.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.500]   However, if possible, always have someone awake 24/7. Preferably set up shifts to ensure
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:09.200]   all get adequate rest, but the group is covered by someone awake. I had a rule that no one
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.680]   went outside alone at night for any reason. If you heard something unusual, you wake up
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.040]   the person who just got off of duty or the person about to go on duty and have them go
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:23.080]   with you. The person on watch also had the car remote control to set off the car lights
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:30.040]   or the car alarm. The nights were stressful due to the darkness and unusual quiet. Without
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.800]   power there were no AC compressors, no cars and no people sounds. The only sounds were
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:42.480]   frogs croaking (yes, in the city frogs) and silence. My generator installation was no
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.400]   noisier than an AC unit, but with the central AC units and the generator we were the noisiest
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.480]   thing for many blocks. Add inside and outside lights and we stood out for some distance,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.120]   hence the concern about security at night. Drinking water gets boring, so have something
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.120]   like Gatorade mix or tea. Keep a positive attitude and a smile on your face. Your mood
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.800]   is contagious. Heat saps strength, stamina and morale. Stay out of the sun, cool and
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.520]   hydrated. Make sure everybody has enough water and is drinking it, not just holding on to
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:23.360]   it. Read about heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Know the symptoms and act fast if you think
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.960]   the person is being affected by the heat. Do not underestimate the emotion of seeing
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.120]   a beloved or even familiar place ruined. Several cops committed suicide as a result of the
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:41.040]   stress. Do not underestimate the level of stress involved. Fire is a hazard and a real
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.800]   possibility. Have a fire watch and remember, you cannot call the fire department or an
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.960]   EMS. There were instances of several houses catching fire and setting a neighboring house
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.840]   on fire. A 24 hour a day fire watch could save your life. Have the garden hoses ready
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.600]   outside in the event a neighbor's house catches fire. Smoke alarms in the halls outside
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.360]   bedrooms and carbon monoxide alarms in every bedroom and other strategic points are a must.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.200]   The carbon monoxide alarms are mandatory if a generator is used.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.720]   Fuel and Power. Always have enough fuel in a vehicle that can carry your group to a safe
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:23.120]   point without refueling. Always have a plan to get you and your group out to a safe place.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.760]   Spare fuel in 5 gallon cans is dangerous. Store it outside in a shady spot. Hide it,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:35.160]   because if you do not, it may be requisitioned. Diesel was almost impossible to find initially,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.640]   but gas was easier to find after the third week. Note, for clarity, I mean in the greater
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.160]   New Orleans area. I had to travel to Baton Rouge or Huma for diesel fuel until about
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.080]   the third week. Consider a tri-fuel generator and hook the generator up to natural gas.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.920]   Natural gas remained on in most unflooded sections, but failed in flooded areas. So
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.080]   do not rely solely on natural gas. Have the capability to run on liquid gasoline as well.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.200]   However, a natural gas generator would have solved my fuel problems.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.920]   Generators are noisy and will disturb you, people nearby, and attract unwanted attention.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.440]   Find some way to keep the sound down. If you have a portable gas operated generator, retrofit
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.640]   a car muffler to it and build a soundbox of some kind. You want the noise signature to
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.160]   be as quiet as possible. Ideally, have a large one permanently installed with quality sound
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.900]   deadening material around it, as I did. Alternatively, dig a hole and put the generator in it and
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.720]   cover it with plywood. Allow for drainage. Build a sandbag berm around it, cover the
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.080]   berm with plywood. Enclose it in a building not connected to the house. Root the exhaust
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.160]   outside. Keep its noise to a minimum. Have an electrician come and put a manual disconnect
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.280]   switch so you can hook the generator to the house. You can do something as simple as putting
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   in the disconnect switch and providing a 50 amp 220 volt plug so you can hook up a portable
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.840]   generator to the house circuits. Avoid having a standalone generator in the backyard with
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.520]   extension cords. Plan ahead and do it right. Also, to keep the peace with your neighbor,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.960]   plan on running one or two 15 amp circuits to their house if they do not have a generator.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.320]   That is enough to run a fridge, lights, and fans. Or a fridge and a small window AC.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.160]   Weapons. Type and quantity is less important than training and proficiency. All those debates
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.940]   about which is best is a meaningless discussion. The best one to have is the one you have right
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.000]   now in your hand. Learn to use it proficiently, including the ability to take it apart and
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.900]   repair it. Make sure you can hit a target at 35 meters one handed with either the left
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.320]   or right hand. Stop debating what is best, settle on what works for you, and spend the
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.640]   time training with it. Do not openly brandish weapons. The National Guard and cops will
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.240]   take them away, despite any laws protecting you. Have spares, so that if cops take them
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:59.120]   away you have others. Do not resist attempts by law enforcement officers to confiscate
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.720]   weapons. It will not end very well for you. Be prepared to be forcibly removed from your
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.200]   premises and leave your pets or have your pets killed in front of you. National Guard
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:16.040]   and law enforcement officers are not necessarily helpful. To be trusted, or your friends. Trust
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.400]   yourself and your friends. Keep a low profile, avoid confrontations, and be respectful and
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   friendly, not subservient to the National Guard and police when contact with them is
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.720]   unavoidable. Obey their instructions, at least when they are around, if possible, and not
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.640]   counter to your goal. Never confront them, or actively or violently resist them. You
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.000]   will lose and become just another unidentified body found in the rubble.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.280]   Cash Documents and Commerce A good way to make a friend is cold, soft
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.960]   drinks. Trade hot for cold if you can when you're giving them away as gifts. I went
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.320]   through a lot of cokes. Image important documents on a scanner, and store them on a flash drive
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.640]   or online by emailing them to yourself at an online webmail account. Driver's license,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.080]   passport, social security card, birth certificate, marriage certificate, insurance policies,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   vaccination and medical records for family and pets should be imaged. Use an online bank
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.160]   and have multiple accounts. Keep multiple credit cards with a $0 balance, so that in
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   an emergency you can at least buy gas, a hotel room, and some food. You need at least $1,000
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:31.040]   of cash on hand. More is always better, but do not carry it all in the same place. Split
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.620]   it up in different pockets and use credit cards wherever possible. Keep your cash in
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:42.800]   small bills like $5, $10, and $20 bills along with a credit card. Checks, traveler's checks,
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.580]   and money orders are useless. Don't waste your time with them. Take photos of your insured
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:53.320]   property and make sure that they are not more than two years old. Use a digital camera and
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.700]   store the photos in multiple places. Any photo albums, documents, or similar such things
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.640]   can be digitized, so if the original is destroyed, you at least have a copy. Look around your
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.720]   house and see what falls into that category. It's amazing how much you lose when you're
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.440]   looking at just a house slab. Back up your data in multiple places and set out a contingency
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.320]   plan for your business. We use nothing but laptops and have contracted with an off-site
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.400]   server to store all of our data files. Everybody can use a virtual private network to set up
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.540]   wherever we may finally stop, assuming they can get to a high-speed internet connection.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:32.940]   In-forwarding malfunctioned, so all our lines did was to ring when they did not get a system
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:38.260]   busy. Have a contingency plan to notify all customers of a number change, or arrange with
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:43.560]   a telephone company to use a trunk-forwarding service. We set up a toll-free number and
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.420]   manned it with a small staff to disseminate contact info. Emails worked fine, as did text
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.520]   messages. Websites also worked well as a means to disseminate telephone numbers.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:03.200]   Looting, looters, and requisitioning Police will loot. It is called requisitioning.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:10.100]   They will take your spare gasoline, supplies, ammunition, first aid kits, ice, water, guns,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.060]   and even your vehicle. They are worse than looters in that they have the force of law
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:21.380]   behind them. They looted cars, booze, TVs, as well as the necessities such as food, water,
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.500]   and clean clothes. Avoid looting parties. They tend to be undisciplined and have numerous
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.100]   armed people. If you join them, watch your back and go only with a group you know, and
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.860]   then stick together. Take only what you need and make restitution when you can do so. Even
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.280]   when you need it, looting is wrong. It belongs to someone else.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:48.540]   The law enforcement officers and National Guard will be hot, tired, scared, and grumpy.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:54.940]   Avoid them at all costs. They will be well-armed, better trained, and are more likely to shoot
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:01.340]   you than the looters. Always approach them slowly with your hands visible and in a non-threatening
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.620]   manner. Politeness, though not submission like you're guilty of something, and a smile
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.520]   on your face and a comment like "Boy, am I glad to see you guys. Thanks for the help."
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.700]   If you are unsure of the situation, extend your hand and a handshake. Their actions will
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:22.500]   tell volumes as to their intent. Never curse them. Do offer them a cold Coke or water.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.300]   If you do not have a cold drink, say "I would offer you guys one, but I don't have
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.620]   one." The US Coast Guard were the best guys. They
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.520]   were most useful, professional, and least dangerous, as long as you were not hostile
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.940]   to them. The worst were the National Guard units and the local police department. They
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:45.660]   were stressed out, lost their homes, separated from loved ones, etc. They were heavily armed
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:51.740]   and dangerous. No offense intended to any member of these units, but that is my observation.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:57.580]   When you travel, travel in groups. No fewer than two. Four in two vehicles are better.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:03.140]   If you leave your vehicles, make sure someone, or preferably two people, stay with them.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:09.080]   Have a prearranged sign and countersign for the group. Include a trouble sign and countersign.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.600]   Do not shout everybody and anybody's name when you think you see trouble. Use a signal
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.420]   when concerned or needing help. You do not have to be silly about it, but a shout of
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.580]   "Hey, Mr. Murphy" is a whole lot more innocuous than "Hey, George and Louis, there
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.900]   are five guys coming towards me." In the latter, you have conveyed to the party coming
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.780]   at you that there are two other people who will be coming shortly. On the other hand,
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.680]   if you shout "Hey, Mr. Murphy" while looking at the group and waving in a friendly-like
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.200]   manner at the people coming at you, they may assume that you are addressing them and waving
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.060]   at them and not calling your buddies to come outside and help. It may just give you the
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.620]   edge in that situation. Look out for people's pets. Save the ones
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:55.060]   you can. Bring food and water for them since it is likely no one else will. Many pets were
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:59.740]   abandoned and died a long, lingering death as a result.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:06.820]   Be very careful to avoid any injuries of any kind. If you are injured, cut, get a blister,
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:13.340]   etc. Treat it aggressively. Even a simple scratch in a disaster zone can be life-threatening.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.060]   Get vaccinations for hepatitis, tetanus, and anything else you can talk your medical doctor
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:22.460]   into giving you. Do not take supplies from the Red Cross, Salvation Army, or others unless
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.820]   you or someone you know truly needs them. Supplies are limited, and others in need may
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:31.160]   do without because you wanted something you did not really need. I saw a single mother
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:37.060]   with a baby and toddler go without water when an "alpha" male barged in line and took
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:42.420]   stuff meant for her. The "alpha" males simply put the water in their pockets and
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:49.460]   walked away. I "found" her some water when the "alpha" males suddenly "dropped"
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.340]   their water and ran for their lives. Be compassionate, but do not be silly. Sometimes
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:01.820]   sympathy targets (old people, disabled people, kids, and women) are used by looters as bait.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.300]   Do not be in the disaster area if you can avoid it. Leave the area until the situation
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.420]   stabilizes. If you have to be there, stay only as long as necessary. It is not a game,
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.380]   and it is definitely not fun.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.380]   Food Water and Ice
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:24.600]   Ice is a very valuable commodity when the temperature is 95 degrees and the humidity
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:31.880]   is 100%. Keep some handy to trade, or barter for favors. Use empty water bottles to make
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.500]   it at home in the freezer. It is a good barter commodity. Safe potable water is critical.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.540]   You cannot have too much of it on hand. I had 10 5-gallon bottles of water on hand,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:51.800]   in addition to 6 cases of 20-ounce bottles of water. That was nowhere near adequate.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.060]   Water is either safe or not. If you have the slightest doubt about the water, then it is
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:02.900]   not safe to drink it. Unsafe water from the tap can be used for flushing toilets and washing
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.780]   clothes. It can also be used for washing you, but do not drink it, and keep it away from
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.820]   your eyes, nose, and mouth when showering with it. However, unsafe water from the tap
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:17.500]   and a 5% to 10% solution of bleach can be used for cleaning dishes with soap as long
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.780]   as the final rinse is in boiled or clean water. Be sure the water has cooled and add 2 or
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.860]   3% bleach to the rinse water. You can rinse the plate to get the food residue off with
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.780]   the running, unboiled water before washing them, but wash them with boiled water. If
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.900]   possible, dip them in a mild bleach solution in the rinse cycle and hand dry. To make clear
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.980]   water safe, boil the water for 5 to 10 minutes at a rolling boil. You can also add chlorine
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.820]   before boiling it if you're really nervous. Be careful and let the water stand at least
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.420]   an hour to avoid burning yourself. Boil as much as you can at one time because it is
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:57.460]   a pain in the neck to boil water. I used a seafood boiler and natural gas for this chore.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:02.040]   Keep the pot covered when the water is boiling and cooling. Store it in a clean, preferably
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.080]   sterilized container. Used but clean 2-liter soft drink bottles are perfect for storing
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:12.380]   boiled water, but wait till it cools to pour it. Potable water should be used as much as
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.020]   possible. For example, water used for cooking rice and spaghetti can be reused for cleaning
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:22.860]   the pots and dishes. An outside propane or natural gas burner with a large boiling pot
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.620]   will make quick work of producing many gallons of safe drinking water without the heat and
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.580]   humidity in the house. This boiling pot can also be used to sanitize plates, silverware,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.340]   and pots. You can attach a large activated charcoal filter to an outside water hose to
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   filter water that you boil for drinking. Boiling may or may not remove toxic chemicals in the
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.980]   water. Use bottled water from a known source, if at all possible, for all drinking, food
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.860]   preparation, washing, and bathing. Water in a pinch can be made safer by filtering it
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.820]   and adding a small amount of Clorox or iodine tablets to the water. Murky or smelly water
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.660]   should not be used for anything, if at all possible. You may be tempted to use the dishwasher
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.700]   and put it on heated water in the sanitized setting, but do not take the risk. It's just
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:10.460]   not worth the risk. Plan on hand washing and sanitizing the dishes yourself. Paper towels,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.460]   plates, and disposable knives and forks work very well, and many times are better than
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.340]   real china and silverware. Have lots of paper towels, garbage bags, and disposable stuff
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:25.980]   on hand. Garbage disposal is a problem. There was not garbage pickup for two months. Plan
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:30.700]   on bringing it to the dump yourself. Sanitation is important and garbage stinks after a week
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.420]   in the sun. When you bring it to the dump, put it on the trailer. Do not put it in the
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:39.580]   car or trunk. You will never get the stink out. Note, you can freeze bottles of unsafe
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:45.980]   water for ice. Just label it as unsafe and do not use or drink the water. Food is important
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.700]   for morale. Cook it and present it well. Sit down together and eat together. This is a
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:56.340]   great morale builder. Simple menu items are important since fresh
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.980]   items are limited, such as spaghetti and meatballs, red beans, rice, and meat, sausage, hamburger,
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:07.300]   chicken, and rice, hamburgers, macaroni, and cheese, scrambled eggs, grits, toast, steak,
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:13.060]   and canned veggies, jambalaya, and meat of any kind. Use MREs only for lunch when out
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:17.540]   and about or as a last resort. Everybody should sit down and eat together at least once a
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.780]   day for better morale. Vehicle
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.660]   Four-wheel drive was not important but was useful mainly due to the higher ground clearance
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:30.320]   it afforded. Bring rope to tie to branches to move them. Make sure the vehicle has auxiliary
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:36.340]   storage like a roof rack, a roof cargo carrier, a trailer hitch back porch, or have a trailer.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.220]   Anything that you can use to carry additional bulky cargo like roofing shingles, gas, clothes,
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:47.620]   food, water, etc. I used my boat as a means to carry cargo such as garbage and fuel. It
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:53.820]   was all I had so I used it as a utility trailer. It had 2 to 18 gallon gas tanks, so filled
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:59.720]   up those tanks and then I put three 55 gallon drums in the boat. Use what you have. Make
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.380]   sure your vehicle is in good shape. A broken fan belt, bad tire, leaking water pump, or
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.260]   battery with a dead cell is useless and dangerous in a disaster zone. Be sure to have a can
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:14.980]   of fix-a-flat, 12-volt air compressor, battery booster, tire plug kit, flashlight with spare
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.020]   batteries and a plug-in 12-volt spotlight (they're cheaper and more reliable than those
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.540]   needing a charge), as well as basic tools like a screwdriver, pliers, and crescent wrench
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:29.220]   are invaluable. A 12-volt to 110-volt inverter (no more than 100 watts to avoid blowing
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.420]   fuses or worse a fusible link), small first aid kit, and rope will also be invaluable.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.140]   A 110-volt trouble light with a 25-foot cord to plug into the inverter will serve multiple
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.580]   purposes of light and power. Just do not overload the inverter. Be sure to have spare oil, brake
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.500]   fluid, automatic transmission fluid, and antifreeze. It doesn't have to be in the car. You will
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:54.180]   not be able to find it. The cargo area, if not "hoseable", should
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.900]   be covered in plastic to prevent the spread of contaminants. A cheaper car or pickup truck
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.820]   will attract a whole lot less negative attention than a bling mobile. Park the Mercedes and
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.660]   Lexus. Drive the pickup truck. Tools
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:12.140]   Basic tools like a socket set, wrench, and screwdrivers, etc. A cordless electric screwdriver
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.300]   and drill will also save you a lot of energy and sweat.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.380]   Other useful tools. Crowbar, large and small, for breaking glass and prying open windows
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.340]   and doors. Pry bar for opening doors. Large bolt cutters. Claw hammer, axe or hatchet.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.820]   Small sledgehammer and wedges. Small, medium, and large.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.140]   Handle protective equipment is very important. Hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, leather
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:38.900]   and latex respirators or face mask. Steel-toed shoes with steel soles. Gas chainsaw. Nice,
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.820]   but not required unless you live in a wooded area. I used the rope in car to pull large
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.140]   branches out of my way. A tree handsaw is just as useful and less costly in an urban
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.660]   area. In a wooded area, buy two chainsaws. One is not enough.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.940]   Tarps of several sizes are good. You can always trade them if you do not need them. An electric
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.300]   sawzall is particularly useful, assuming you have a generator. Chain and padlocks will
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:05.060]   always come in handy. Electrical extension cords? Get several and buy the thick contractor
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.420]   grade. Also, a power strip with a surge suppressor for each cord will be useful.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:16.020]   Tape, electrical and duct. Spray paint, white, orange and black, for signs, warning and messages.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.420]   Preprinted signs, like "Looters will be shot" are not as useful as handmade signs,
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:25.100]   since the preprinted ones may indicate no one is around. Also, date any spray painted
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:32.380]   signs so people know it is up post-disaster. Boats in urban settings and flood water.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.180]   If you have the misfortune of dealing with a flood, there will be all kinds of hazards
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.940]   that you will encounter, such that even the oldest of salts will be in a challenging environment.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:46.700]   Operate the boat only at idle or slow speeds. Do not let the boat get on a plane. Displacement
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:52.380]   speed only. There will be signs, wires, tree shrubs, debris and many other things that
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:57.300]   will destroy or damage an out-drive. Better to hit something at slow speed.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:02.240]   Trim the engine up to reduce your draft. Travel in pairs and maintain radio watches. Be wary
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.060]   of manhole covers if you go in the water. The covers may be gone. There are ditches
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.660]   and various other obstacles that are not apparent. Do not walk in the water, if at all possible.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:17.340]   Always wear a personal flotation device, even an inflatable one is better than nothing.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.040]   Navigation will be difficult since road signs may be obscured, and your GPS will likely
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.540]   have a nautical chart rather than I-10 on it. Have someone on the boat who knows the
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:31.900]   area. Power lines may still be energized, so stay away from them. Do not touch them.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.860]   For the record, rescued people are not always grateful to be rescued. They may be in shock,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.380]   terrified, disoriented, and/or potentially dangerous. Always have at least one other
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.740]   you can trust in the boat with you. You can concentrate on steering, and he/she should
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.380]   concentrate on the people in the boat. Never assume people can swim. Provide a personal
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.780]   flotation device for all and make them wear it. If nothing else, it will be reassuring
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:41:01.260]   for them. If you encounter hostile people, exit the area ASAP. Always know how to get
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.700]   out of an area quickly. Do not fool around in floodwaters. They are
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:14.220]   nasty, disgusting, and dangerous. Do not handle any floating bodies unless you want a very,
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:19.880]   very unpleasant experience. Do not ford the water in your vehicle if you can avoid it.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:24.700]   Check the depth on foot before you even consider fording water. Most vehicles can get their
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:29.500]   drivetrain damaged by as little as a foot of water. The vehicle will also kick up wakes
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.260]   into people's homes. The people in the house may object violently to you flooding their
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:40.220]   already damaged house. If you do ford water, do so at an idle speed and pay close attention
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.380]   to water depth. If in doubt, back up to higher ground.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.940]   Judging the water depth is deceptive since cars have different heights. Oftentimes the
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:55.600]   center of the road is the highest side. Consider using the sidewalk, lawns, or road median
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.280]   to at least keep part of your vehicle high enough not to flood.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:06.800]   Elderly, infirm, pets, and kids. None of these belong in a disaster zone and should be evacuated
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.080]   as soon as possible. Pets will be destroyed at the slightest bit of inconvenience to the
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.760]   authorities. Chip your pet and evacuate them. Keep their shots current and board them with
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.360]   friends, families, or a boarding facility. There were numerous instances of pets summarily
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:28.040]   destroyed for a variety of reasons, including simply spite. Two deputies in St. Bernard
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.420]   Parish are facing charges for shooting pets for no apparent reason. The incidents were
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.320]   captured on videotape. Despite this, they would never have been charged if left to the
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.680]   local officials. One can only imagine what else went on and was not uncovered.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.240]   An elderly woman recounted to me her story about how she refused to leave her home because
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.320]   her pet could not come with her. The law enforcement officer simply shot her beloved pet in front
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.400]   of her and said, "Now the problem is solved," and put the woman in a boat. I heard from
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.200]   others in different areas that they were forced to abandon their pets under threat of physical
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:06.000]   threat. Some of these pets survived, others did not. In a truly bad situation, you should
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.860]   assume this attitude will expand to children and non-able-bodied people as well. In fact,
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.320]   in wartime, this type of behavior has been documented in various parts of the world.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.660]   There was also the case of 32 nursing home patients that were abandoned and subsequently
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.680]   drowned in St. Bernard Parish. In another case, an elderly woman and her middle-aged,
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.040]   quadriplegic son were told a special van would come get them. No transportation arrived,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.520]   and they both died. If you are handicapped, elderly, have children or pets, make your
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.640]   own plans to evacuate. Do not rely on any government plan to assist you. Rely only on
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.960]   yourself.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   Evacuation Issues
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.640]   Leave early or late. A tough call depends on your circumstances and how likely your
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.620]   risk is to be versus that of staying put. Just do not wait too long. Allow 12 hours
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:02.200]   to get to safety. Which route to use? Be flexible and do not be afraid to use back routes. Speed
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.680]   is less important than steady progress away from danger. Keep a close watch on your gas
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.440]   tank. Look for gas at half a tank. Search diligently for gas at a quarter of a tank.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:18.480]   Look for a safe place to stop at an eighth of a tank. Do not run out of gas. If you have
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:25.400]   to use your reserve tank, find shelter nearby and wait until it is safe. Gas gives you
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:32.200]   options. No gas leaves you vulnerable. If necessary, abandon one vehicle and strip all
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.920]   fuel from it. Discard stuff in the following order, if necessary. Goods to make things
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:45.120]   fit. Magazines, clothes, ice chests, food, spare tire, tools, adults, children and elderly,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:51.280]   pets. Never discard water or fuel. If someone has to be left behind, at a safe place obviously,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   leave two people and give them cash and a credit card, water, cell phone and set an
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:01.960]   alternate rally point. If possible, travel in two cars. Evacuation is very dangerous.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.280]   Your car could break down and leave you and your loved ones stranded with an impending
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:11.440]   disaster en route. Two cars capable of carrying all is the safest way to travel. Do not rely
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.640]   on the law enforcement officers to assist. They will be busy and the phrase "SOL"
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:22.240]   comes to mind. What to bring? See the above list but include at least 5 gallons of gasoline,
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.720]   food, simple stuff like bread and peanut butter, and at least 1 gallon of water for every two
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.000]   people. Be sure to carry the gas on top of the vehicle, on the roof rack, not inside
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.080]   the car. It will make everyone nauseous otherwise. Have maps, a laptop with an internet card
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:43.040]   to stay in touch with the outside world, and a GPS is also very useful. FMRS and CB radios
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.080]   do work well here but are obnoxious to have on all the time. The driver's job is to
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.640]   drive and do nothing else other than keep an eye outside the vehicle. The traffic will
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.280]   range from a creeping 10-20 mph to 60 mph bumper to bumper traffic. It is demanding
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.160]   and tiring to drive like this for 6-12 hours at a time. If possible, appoint one of the
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.520]   passengers navigator. The navigator is responsible for keeping track of the location of both
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.800]   vehicles, nearby alternate routes, and maintains communication with the other vehicle. Other
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.160]   passengers can be utilized to find accommodations, gas, and other necessary information via cell
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.080]   phone or internet, as well as tend to the needs of the other passengers or driver. A
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:32.040]   12V TV can provide invaluable news. The traffic will be moving very slowly. 10-20 mph is not
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.440]   unusual so be patient and do not plan on being able to get off the highway for anything for
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:42.560]   at least 5-8 hours. A pee bucket is absolutely vital. For males, a simple 32 oz cup with
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:48.520]   a lid, a 2L bottle, and a funnel or a wide mouth 1-2L juice bottle will work nicely.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.720]   Women may use the same thing but with a funnel. Be sure to have a towel handy. Do not dump
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.920]   it on the road unless you are traveling very slowly, which is normally the case. Keep it
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.000]   sealed in a ziplock bag in between uses to avoid messes. Kids, especially pre-teen girls,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.440]   may pose special problems due to modesty issues. Talk to those involved. It will be a problem,
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.720]   and stopping may not be an option, assuming you can even pull over.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.320]   It depends on the situation, but generally the farther away the better. Yet, the closer
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.960]   the destination, the easier it will be to get there. Where you go is up to your budget.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.400]   I suggest someplace with family and friends to help you assimilate in case the stay is
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.700]   a long one. For stays over 2 weeks, a furnished, corporate apartment is generally a better
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:33.320]   deal and more comfortable and normal than a hotel room.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.920]   Evacuation by Air This is the safest and easiest way to evacuate,
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:40.960]   but you cannot take much with you. This is generally best if you have a house elsewhere
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.840]   or you have small children, elderly, or infirm people to remove. When you leave, be sure
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.400]   to leave your car parked at an inside garage and at least one level above the ground floor.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.680]   Do not count on this method unless you own your own plane, since flights are generally
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.960]   booked well in advance. Personal Gear
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.180]   You should always carry the following. A butt pack with flashlight, pistol (assuming you
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.420]   have the relevant permit), reload, cigarette lighter, pepper spray, Leatherman tool, latex
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.340]   gloves, small hand sanitizer, and digital camera, spare batteries, and spare data card.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.820]   The camera should be kept in a plastic baggie to protect it. Why the camera? So you can
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.580]   show others what you saw and get their input into situations.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.900]   Water (at least one bottle), clean towel, spare shoes, spare clothes, and wading boots.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.960]   I typically wore a jumpsuit and running shoes. I changed my shoes to steel-toed boots when
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.640]   I got out of the car and again when I got back in. A hat and sunscreen were also very
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   handy. Sanitation
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.280]   Wash your hands, wash your face with a clean towel before you go into the house if you
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:43.760]   have been out on expedition. Hand sanitizer and plain old alcohol works great if potable
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.280]   water is not available. Thick plastic or chemical resistant gloves as well as latex gloves to
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.680]   protect yourself from chemicals like chlorine. Leave your shoes outside and do not track
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:59.440]   any crud inside. If you wear a jumpsuit with shorts underneath, shuck the jumpsuit and
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.880]   put it in a garbage bag along with any towels used. Leave your boots outside. Everything
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.800]   dirty goes in the washing machine. Anything recovered from the floodwater stays outside.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.560]   Set up a hose and bucket with dishwashing liquid to clean off anything nasty and leave
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.880]   it outside.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.340]   After writing that initial response, Raptor goes on to clarify, "This was an overview
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:25.120]   of my experiences over a three-month period. Even after the power came on, after about
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:31.000]   twenty-two days, things were still dicey. Hurricane Rita also provided some excitement.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.160]   My area of town was restored to some level of normalcy by February 2006. However, the
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.580]   rebuilding of the city itself has stalled, and the social disintegration, which was crudely
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:47.080]   sewn back together, has continued to unravel." And then he asks if there are other specific
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:52.360]   questions from his fellow forum posters.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.040]   Now in a follow-up post, Raptor was asked a few questions. I'm going to read several
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:01.280]   of the follow-up posts to you because they're quite interesting to get his personal experience.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.080]   He writes, "Let me provide a little more background on myself, though for privacy's
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.960]   sake I'll not be too forthcoming. I'm white and middle-aged. I've done very well in life.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.840]   Missouri is not in New Orleans proper, so the New Orleans Police Department had no jurisdiction
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.660]   in Metairie. Sheriff Harry Lee was in charge, for better or worse. He did things differently
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:22.900]   in Jefferson Parish. My family has lived in New Orleans long enough to have participated
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:27.760]   in the first Battle of New Orleans." One questioner writes, "How did you secure your
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.480]   home during the nights?" I'll provide more details later, but briefly, my house sits
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.720]   up eight feet off the ground, with only two ways in (and out) when the hurricane shutters
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:42.040]   are down and dogged. It is made of concrete and only the two doors are exposed. You can
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.440]   see both exits from the middle of the house. One person, assuming he is awake, can control
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:52.120]   access quite easily. Note, this security comes at a price of limited exit in case of a fire,
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:57.400]   hence my emphasis on fire safety. Question, "Did your stockpiled food last as long as
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.720]   you expected and what changes to your inventory would you have made?" I'll write more about
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.660]   this in another post, however food quantity was not a problem, since I had been laying
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.720]   in supplies for my family, plus two, and at any given time I had fewer people than I allowed
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.960]   for in the provisioning plan. The taste quality of the food I had on hand was the real morale
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:20.560]   killer though. So, while we did not starve, we did give away a lot of the MREs, but kept
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:26.280]   the canned and dry stuff for our consumption. Also, the heat killed your desire to eat,
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.840]   and between the taste and the heat we had plenty of food. Safe drinking water was in
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:36.520]   short supply though. Another questioner writes in with this comment, "I'm not at all surprised
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.940]   that the police are one of the most dangerous groups out there in New Orleans. From what
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.620]   I heard and read on other blogs, there should be a lot more prosecution from the corrupt
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:48.280]   and crooked cops than what they did to civilians out there." Raptor writes, "There is currently
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.080]   a case going to trial soon involving seven police officers accused of murder during Katrina.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.480]   If you google the Danziger 7 you can read all sides about the case. There are many unclear
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:01.560]   issues and I do not want to go into that matter. What is clear is that two people who were
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.020]   in the wrong place at the right time were shot and killed. One was shot seven times
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.760]   in the back, not once in the front. This person was mentally handicapped, had no criminal
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.640]   record, none had criminal records, and was claimed to have had a weapon and shot at the
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:21.280]   police. In a time of unrest, keep a low profile, do not openly brandish weapons, and do not
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.920]   look like some warrior out of Road Warrior. You will survive a lot better if you look
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:32.640]   like a utility repair guy or responder than you will looking like trouble. Stay away,
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.920]   for the people you do not know, with guns, whether or not they have badges, if at all
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.160]   possible. My motto is, when someone from the government shows up at your door and says
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.640]   he is there to help, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction."
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:50.320]   Question, "If you saw police, for evacuation purposes, coming to your home but they did
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.800]   not see you, is it a crime to hide out and to protect your home and pets? Like if they
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.280]   call to see if anyone is at home, you just pretend you didn't hear it?"
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.920]   During the first three weeks, there was utter chaos on the street. No one knew who was in
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.240]   charge and those in charge, when they did make a decision, which was a very rare event,
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.520]   could not communicate instructions reliably. That meant local commanders were left to their
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:16.000]   own discretion. At one point, the mayor of Orleans Parish, the city of New Orleans, made
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.080]   a statement that martial law had been declared. The state attorney general quickly denied
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:27.000]   that and said the mayor has no such authority and martial law is not legal and in fact unconstitutional,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.360]   has been since General Butler left New Orleans in 1865 and martial law was ended under Louisiana
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.400]   law.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.320]   How does this matter to your questions? At one point, the cops and National Guard were
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.400]   kicking down doors and searching homes and forcibly removing anyone they found. Pets
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:47.200]   could not come and if you resisted, they would arrest you. Any and all weapons were confiscated
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.880]   and resistance was futile. In other parts of the city, they would knock politely on
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:56.120]   the door, inquire about you and give you water and MREs. Legal or illegal, it was whatever
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   the local commanders, the organized guys with the guns wanted it to be. Sounds like a fundamental
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.640]   lesson in personal liberty to me.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.440]   Now following that comment, there's some back and forth in the forum thread on some more
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:13.640]   mundane topics and also on the law enforcement issue. Raptor provides his information after
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.680]   some other comments in this way. He says, "I'm not going to defend or condemn the New
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   Orleans Police Department as a whole. I think many were good, loyal and public servants
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.880]   and a few bad guys led by idiots. Common sense was washed away. Unfortunately, idiots seem
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.640]   to abound in the world today. If this garbage can happen in New Orleans, it can happen anywhere.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:39.160]   That is not paranoia, simply realism." Goes on to attach a link to a site that deals with
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.460]   the mass destruction of people's pets in a school in St. Bernard Parish and there was
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.880]   some prosecution there. And he points this out.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:50.720]   "Finally, I would also point out that it was not just the New Orleans Police Department
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.960]   and Louisiana National Guard breaking into homes and dragging people out. It included
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.760]   Texas, New York, Arkansas, California, and other state police, wildlife and fisheries
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:05.000]   agents as well as National Guard units and regular army. All that I encountered proved
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.040]   bribeable. Greed is hardwired into the basic human brain."
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.300]   Now of course another commenter goes on and asks how he engaged in bribes and what the
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:19.480]   average bribe was. Was it money, supplies? Did they come back for more or just go away?
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:24.700]   And this I think is some of the more interesting interaction with Raptor and is a good example
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.760]   of why one of the reasons why money and supplies are so important and so valuable because they
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:34.900]   give you the way to buy yourself into and out of situations like this where all of the
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.580]   government agents, the guys with guns, are in charge. So Raptor goes on and writes this
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.020]   in answer to that question.
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.040]   "It really depended on the situation and the person. I would look at the person and
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.100]   see what they may want at the time. The bribe might be as simple as a cold coke or Gatorade
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.220]   or may have been a few hundred dollars. Let me also stress that no one ever said to me,
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:59.060]   'I'll let you do it for a hundred dollars.' My experience is that the only people uttering
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:03.540]   phrases like that outside of the movies are about to either set you up or they are so
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:08.980]   corrupt that your life is possibly in danger. View it as if you are giving a tip. I have
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:13.940]   lived in third world countries and can generally read people, especially officials. When paying
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:20.540]   cash I would hand them a drink and discreetly use a $20 bill or $100 bill as the napkin
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:25.360]   wrapped around the drink. I would then offer my hand in a handshake and keep the same smile
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:31.460]   on my face. No winks, nods, or anything else like that. When I traveled I kept an ice chest
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:37.940]   with soft drinks, Gatorade or water along with MREs and about $1,000 cash in $10, $20,
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:44.220]   or $100 bills in my pocket separate from my wallet and ID. Never ever take out your wallet,
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:49.540]   reach in and take out money, nor should you whip out a huge wad of cash. Do not say, 'How
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:54.980]   much will it take?' Do not be overt or crude. You will be surprised how much you can do
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:00.100]   with a smile, pleasant banter, and something a person wants. The most overt I got was to
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.980]   hand the guy my papers, let him tell me to get the heck out of his face, and then ask
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.420]   him what I had to do to get where I wanted to go. I would wait for his reaction. If he
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.940]   offered information I would then say, 'Well, you seem to be in charge. Could you approve
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:18.420]   it?' I would wait for the response and either conclude the deal knowing it would be expensive
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.500]   or go elsewhere. If his reaction was belligerent and negative, no amount of persuasion would
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:29.020]   work. You should leave immediately and either try later or somewhere else. I also gave out
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:35.940]   suntan lotion, mosquito repellent, ice, clean towels, baby wipes. These were always welcomed.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:41.780]   I also would give out MREs and drinks to people, looters or survivors, as well as a $10 or
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:47.380]   $20 bill on occasion. My logic for this was, I did not like the MREs, and if I could avoid
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:54.060]   a confrontation and danger to me and/or my group for an MRE, cold coke, and $10, that
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:59.540]   is a cheap transaction. Besides, a magazine or cylinder of bullets can cost more than
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:04.900]   the $10. What is interesting is that most looters were generally satisfied with a cold
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:10.780]   coke and a few kind words. Having said that, I always kept a compact 9mm or .357 snubby
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.880]   in my pocket, and when I was being nice to the looters or survivors, I also was ready
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:21.940]   to end the conversation suddenly and, if necessary, violently. Finally, try to use the same checkpoints
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:26.860]   of people there know you. Just like in business, it is not what you know or what you have so
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:33.140]   much as who you know. I used two main checkpoints, and I became known as Ben. (Ben Franklin is
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:40.300]   on the $100 bill.) I knew I had made it when one sentry waved and shouted to his commander,
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:44.860]   "It's okay, it's Ben!" When that happened, there were cokes all around for everyone,
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.940]   and everyone needed a napkin to reinforce the positive experience of seeing me. They
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:54.060]   never asked for money, but they remembered me and treated me well. I always took care
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:58.700]   of them. There were six guys at that command post and checkpoint working the day shift,
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:03.500]   and they were there for six weeks. I was kind of sorry to see them go. One final note. The
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:11.180]   value of barter goods changed rapidly due to supply and demand. Initially, real MREs
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:16.060]   with a heater inside, of all things, were in high demand. Then they became the proverbial
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:22.860]   fruitcake. People gave them to you, but nobody really wanted to eat them. Gas was worth its
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:27.820]   weight in gold, and diesel was even more valuable initially. But once the supplies were up and
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:33.180]   available, they lost their value beyond retail for barter purposes. Personal toiletries like
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:40.140]   sun tan lotion, mosquito repellent, baby wipes, of all things, hand sanitizers, and clean
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:45.580]   towels all were very useful to trade. The one item that held its value was a cold soft
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:51.220]   drink or bottled water. I suspect in cold climates, a hot drink would hold the same
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.220]   value.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:57.020]   Now, from here, and of course, I'm reading from a forum thread, so there's a conversation
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.940]   happening. Feel free to read the entire location, but I want to read the entire forum thread
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:06.980]   yourself in the show notes. But you don't need to, because I'm giving you the gist of
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.740]   the story from this particular person's perspective. And I think it's important to do so. I want
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.180]   to provide this for you in an audio format where you can listen to it. But he shares,
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.140]   Raptor shares an interesting story of what happened that just gives a little bit of local
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:24.900]   color into what was happening in the local situation. He says, "My business partner,
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.700]   who has significant wealth, had a home that was flooded. Inside the home was, as I referred
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:36.140]   to it, name brand art, originals whose artist names would be recognized by most people.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.520]   The collection was worth a lot of money. He lived in an enclave, which has a pool house
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.380]   over 3,000 square feet, never mind the main house or guest house. Anyway, a few of his
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.300]   neighbors hired Blackwater to provide security while the place was flooded. We could not
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.700]   move the art out since the risk of name brand art in a boat is too risky for the insurance
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:01.300]   company. The art was hanging on the wall about three feet above the water level and was safe,
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:06.620]   but we just could not get to it safely because of debris, etc. So these Blackwater guys hunkered
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:10.420]   down on the second story of his home and a couple of neighbors' homes and kept looters
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.420]   out. They lived there for over two weeks. Anyway, the water finally goes down and we
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.680]   drive in with a truck and with several guys, including my partner and I. We chainsaw and
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.000]   yank trees out of the street so we can drive the truck up to the front yard and load up
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.700]   the artwork. There were about six of us and two of my guys are providing security, but
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.500]   we're not openly carrying weapons because we knew the Blackwater guys were around. We
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.620]   had them stashed away so we were not mistaken for looters. Anyway, this nondescript guy
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:40.020]   with a Glock and two mags and a holster comes walking up to my partner nonchalantly. My
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:45.780]   partner hands him his card and says what was obviously a password to this guy. The guy
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:50.100]   is cool and everybody goes to do their thing. Meanwhile, the Blackwater guy and my partner
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:54.420]   were talking. I noticed something about the Blackwater guy that does not look right. I
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.660]   couldn't place it at first, but then it hit me. His pants were pressed and he was wearing
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:03.000]   a clean t-shirt. Meanwhile, I look around at our guys and everyone is drenched in sweat
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.100]   and looks like a bum, especially me. However, then it really dawns on me. Not only is the
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.660]   guy clean, but he's not sweating very much at all. I then eye the guy and realize he's
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.540]   one of those very lean muscular people who, because they have so little body fat, hardly
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:22.860]   sweat. It is then that I realize his nonchalant walk was really just that. He did not need
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.580]   that Glock to kill everyone there. He could probably rip everyone's head off and kill
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:31.460]   them without need of a weapon. We were absolutely no threat in his eyes. He had been camping
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.620]   out in a flooded house for two weeks and was going home, and he looked better than we did
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:41.260]   after being on the job less than an hour. No lesson, just local color.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:49.540]   Now, in a separate post, Raptor goes on and again, this particular forum is quite militant
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.980]   kind of appreciation for weapons and such. But he talks about this, and I think it's
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.700]   important, an important lesson. He says, "I'm going to climb on my soapbox now, and I'm
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.060]   not addressing anyone in particular. Too many people think planning and preparation involves
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.580]   having the best rifle, the best shotgun, the best pistol, and enough ammunition to hold
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:10.060]   off an army. Too many people turn it into some kind of video game. When the SHTF, it
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.780]   will not be pretty or fun. It will be dirty, grimy, and smelly, and not something that
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:21.660]   you want to do. I would prefer never to have to go through that situation ever again. However,
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:26.060]   two monster storms have hit in my lifetime, Camille and Katrina, and I certainly expect
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:32.060]   another, so I deal with it. Preparation involves many more skills than firearms and gunsmithing,
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.700]   stockpiling food and water. In addition to worrying about the adequacy of an arsenal,
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:41.180]   you should worry about how do I perform basic plumbing jobs, how do I disconnect or reconnect
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:45.660]   an electrical meter from a house, how to fix the generator, flat tire, or nail on a tarp
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:50.580]   or shingles to patch a roof. Basic electrical, plumbing, car repairs, and carpentry skills
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.380]   are always skills that you can use, and if necessary, trade for goods in a prolonged
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:01.880]   SHTF situation. Knowledge and skills are fundamentally valuable. In Orland's Parish, there was one
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:07.020]   guy who stayed open and did nothing but fix flat tires on cars. He had a skill very much
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:12.100]   in demand, and no one messed with him because he was "harmless and useful." A perception
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:18.340]   of "harmless and useful" is a very good position to be in. Fundamentally, you cannot
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:23.600]   stockpile enough food, water, and ammunition to last the rest of your life. However, knowledge
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.260]   and skills do not go stale, nor can anyone take them away. Technology may change, but
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:33.740]   you can adapt your skill set. The other skill is the mindset of survival
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:38.220]   and awareness, identifying potential risks and how they evolve, coping with the stress,
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:42.540]   and thinking outside of the box. I like to quote a movie line, "The hero, when asked
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:48.300]   what his favorite weapon was, said, 'My brains.'" Not saying firearms are not necessary,
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:54.580]   all I'm saying is training and knowledge are every bit as important.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:05:00.820]   Now another listener or writer writes to Raptor and talks to him about the idea in his commentary
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:05.980]   on bribes, and I thought his discussion here was useful for you to hear. Somebody alleges
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:11.620]   that Louisiana has a higher bribe culture than other places. Raptor writes this, "I
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.820]   was waiting for someone who was going to make that comment about the culture of corruption
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.100]   that exists in Louisiana. I cannot imagine anyone being insulted by someone saying they
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.660]   come from a culture of corruption." I agree Louisiana has that reputation, and
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:29.380]   certainly having an ex-governor in jail for the last five years and a congressman with
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:34.060]   $90,000 in the freezer does not help that image. I take no offense at your statement,
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:39.140]   nor do I deny or defend any one of the scumbucket politicians. Nor, for that matter, do I advocate
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:43.940]   bribery in any form. In fact, I have a reputation for not giving a dime to local political campaigns
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:50.380]   or politicians in any form whatsoever. I cannot stand most of them. However, in a chaotic
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:56.260]   situation, money is one more tool to consider using. I brought up the subject since there
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:02.940]   was so much conversation about whether money was useful in a disaster. It is. I would also
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.900]   point out that historically people have been able to buy their way out of death camps,
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:12.420]   across borders to freedom, obtain important supplies, and get transportation from behind
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:19.580]   enemy lines with money, gold, diamonds, and promises of money. Blood shits. Bribery has
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:24.420]   worked in the US Civil War on both sides, Khmer Rouge, Nazi, Communist China, even North
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:31.480]   Korea today. Greed is hardwired into the brain of normal people. It is a weakness and opportunity
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.820]   that can be utilized in an emergency. It is up to you to know when and how to use it.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.740]   At some point, I do agree you will have to explain your actions to a higher power. I'm
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:48.020]   cool with that too. However, I do want to address the stereotype of Louisiana being
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:53.020]   inherently more corrupt than any other place in the US. Let's go over some politicians
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:07:00.060]   who got in trouble and gives a list of politicians who are in jail for bribery and corruption.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:05.620]   In a later question, Raptor is asked about why it is that he was involved in trying to
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:10.100]   get through checkpoints. He says this, "As far as Ben's, I spent fewer than most would
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:14.660]   assume. The cold drinks were quite welcome and effective. As for what I got out of it,
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:18.860]   if you're asking if I engaged in nefarious activity during this time, absolutely not.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.340]   I have business and real estate in the city that required attention. I got access and
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:29.260]   assistance in a time of chaos when others were wrongfully denied access. Nothing more.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:34.740]   The biggest thing I received was to be left unharassed. I went in to secure my property.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.700]   If I did not do it, no one else would. Given a choice, I would have preferred to have stayed
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:43.820]   in Atlanta with my family and simply not dealt with the situation. Unfortunately, the buck
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:44.820]   stops with me."
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:51.460]   Now, much, much later in the forum discussion, there are a couple of other unique insights
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.420]   from Raptor. And here I'm going to provide a little bit of commentary. First, somebody
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.420]   had previously written this suggestion, "I have enough money with you for at least two
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:04.740]   weeks. Many of those who arrived here had very little in cash, relying on checkbooks
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:09.100]   and credit cards to fund their purchases. Guess what? Their small banks down in South
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:15.740]   Louisiana were all offline, and their balances, credit authorizations, etc. could not be checked.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:19.300]   Another thing, don't bring only large bills. Many gas stations, convenience stores, etc.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.780]   won't accept anything larger than a $20 bill. Some of my guests had plenty of $100
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:27.940]   bills but couldn't buy anything. I think it may be a good idea to have a bug-out bank
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:32.300]   account with a national bank so that funds should be available anywhere they have a branch,
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.060]   rather than keeping all of one's money in a single bank, particularly a local one or
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.060]   credit union."
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:41.660]   This is, of course, over and above one's bug-out stash of ready cash. Raptor writes
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.960]   back and, of course, reminds us, "Forget precious metals and debit cards. In the early
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.020]   days of a situation like this, cash and an Amex card is the answer."
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.860]   Now, that was Raptor's perspective, but I just want to reiterate, it's important
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.260]   to make sure that you always have money, and you should have that money in the most fungible
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:04.100]   forms, the most readily accepted forms. And so cash is always your solution. And what
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:10.520]   people often forget, cash is not always your solution. Cash is frequently your first solution.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:16.260]   And so when we think of a concept like diversification, you want to practice diversification in every
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.700]   area of your life. You don't put all your money in one bank account.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.980]   Now, is it possible that you don't put all your money in one bank account because
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:31.620]   that bank could go down and could go bankrupt? Sure. FDIC protection, sure, it's valuable.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.460]   That'll protect you in that situation. But you don't keep all your money in one bank
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.580]   account because if your bank is a regional bank or a local credit union and your local
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:43.460]   area is wiped out, as these banks were in New Orleans, you don't have access to anything.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:47.620]   You don't have access to your money. So you diversify your banking systems. You make sure
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:51.300]   that you have money in local accounts. You make sure that you have money in a national
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:56.300]   bank account. You make sure that you have cash in various forms. Sometimes the $100
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:02.900]   bill is the bill that you need because that's what opens the door to access to town or something
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:06.780]   like that. But in other situations, you need those fives and tens. So you make sure that
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:11.500]   you set aside a diversity of money. One of the things I frequently have recommended to
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.300]   people whenever you're putting aside emergency cash, what I recommend you do is set aside,
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.000]   let's say you're going to set it aside in $1,000 chunks. That's a convenient form to
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.020]   set it aside in. Make sure you have a few hundred dollar bills, some fifties, twenties,
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.220]   fives, tens, and ones. Put all of those things there. Make sure that they're all there. Similar
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:33.460]   things, precious metals don't work. They don't do you any good in the context of a hurricane.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.860]   A cold case of beer in a cooler will buy you probably more than precious metals will. But
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:42.940]   on the other hand, if you're in a different situation, then that cold case of beer doesn't
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:48.540]   do what precious metals will. So don't, this is the error in people's thinking is basically
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:54.140]   all of these forms are valuable and it depends on the actual disaster. So if you diversify
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:59.980]   your savings, if you diversify your cash holdings, then you have options. Same thing, good American
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:04.580]   Express card or a few different credit cards that buys you a whole bunch of things really
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:10.180]   fast. It would be a pain to always keep tens of thousands of dollars around in cash just
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:14.620]   for emergencies, but you can easily keep aside significant amounts of money that would be
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:21.820]   available in a course of weeks and then just float those weeks with the use of credit cards.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:29.100]   Couple other points here made by, a couple other points made by Raptor. And first, of
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.620]   course, with pets, you are responsible for caring for the members of your family. So
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:39.580]   that's pets or if that is elderly people or if that is handicapped family members or if
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.880]   that's young children, you have to think differently. My circumstance, having young children is
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.200]   different than your circumstance if you have elderly parents, but you need to think ahead
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:55.260]   and take responsibility for those in your life, including your pets. So again, here
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.400]   is a comment by a different person. "When help gets there, you may get it whether you
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.140]   like it or not. There are numerous reports of aggressive overbearing behavior by those
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:06.820]   rescuers who are first arrived at disaster scenes. It's perhaps best described as, 'I'm
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.660]   here to rescue you. I'm in charge. Do as I say. If you don't, I'll shoot you.' In
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:15.260]   one incident, a family who had prepared and survived quite well were ordered, not invited,
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.020]   to get onto a truck with only the clothes on their back. When they objected, they were
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.540]   threatened. They had pets and wanted to know what would happen to them, and they report
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.180]   that a uniformed man, agency unknown, began pointing his rifle at the pets with the words,
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.700]   'I'll fix that.' " Raptor's comment, "Prepare for your pets. Do not turn them over to the
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.180]   authorities and expect them to be returned alive." Additional comment, "There seems
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.660]   to be a cumulative psychological effect upon survivors. This is clear even, or perhaps
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.900]   particularly in those who were prepared for a disaster. During and immediately after the
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:48.620]   disaster, these folks were at their best, dealing with damage, setting up alternative
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:54.540]   accommodation, light, food sources, etc. However, after a few days in the heat and debris, perhaps
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.700]   worst of all being the smell of dead bodies nearby, many found their ability to remain
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:03.620]   positive and upbeat being strained to the limit. There are numerous reports of individuals
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:07.900]   becoming depressed, morose, and withdrawn. This seemed to happen to even the strongest
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:13.420]   personalities. The arrival of rescuers provided a temporary boost, but once evacuated, a sort
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:18.460]   of after-action shell shock seems to be commonly experienced." I don't know enough about this
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.460]   to comment further, but I suspect that staying in place has a lot to do with it. There is
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:27.140]   no challenge to keep moving, find one's survival needs, and care for the group, and one is
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:32.140]   surrounded by vivid reminders of the devastation. By staying among the ruins of one's former
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:37.180]   life, one may be exposing oneself to a greater risk of psychological deterioration. Raptor's
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:41.740]   response was this, "Do not underestimate the psychological toll that a disaster will
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:47.140]   take on you and your loved ones. The impact will be much worse than you think. These post-disaster
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:52.140]   problems were evident in a lot of people. PTSD-related problems, domestic violence,
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.580]   suicide, and depression were epidemic. The stress also likely accelerated the deaths
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:01.980]   of many elderly people who could not deal with the stress and related issues." That's
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:08.380]   Raptor's point. I would simply say one of the most valuable reasons for you to be prepared
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:14.140]   is to seek to maintain any degree of normalcy and low stress in your life that you can.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:19.940]   Now, you can't evade all stress in life. You can't evade all disasters that would happen,
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:23.940]   but anything you can do to keep your family together, to keep yourself together, and to
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:29.740]   maintain any normalcy that is possible will help. And if you're in a situation where you
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:35.420]   see significant toll happening, don't be scared to spend money or whatever is needed to make
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.580]   sure that you attend to the psychological and emotional and spiritual needs of yourself
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:45.260]   and your family. Those things have a very long-term influence, and it's important to
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:50.580]   make sure that anything is possible that you maintain your health in those areas.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.500]   One other question came in this way. Another commenter had written this, "Your personal
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.900]   and/or corporate supplies and facilities may be commandeered without warning, receipt,
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:03.700]   or compensation. I've had numerous reports from in and near the disaster zone of individuals
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:09.060]   (for example, boat owners, farmers with barns, tractors, etc.) and corporate groups (such
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.320]   as companies with heavy equipment, churches with halls, etc.) finding an official on their
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.940]   doorstep demanding the use of their facilities or equipment. If they demurred, they were
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:22.940]   told that this was an emergency situation and that their assistance was being required,
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.700]   not requested." Raptor responds with this comment. He says, "I ran into this myself
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:34.500]   with fuel. Both gasoline and diesel were requisitioned from me. It pissed me off each and every time,
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:39.620]   but I did give it to them. So I guess I have no one to blame for this but me."
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:44.180]   Another commenter asks Raptor specifically, he says, "Who requisitioned it from you?
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.600]   How did they go about it? Did they ask nicely? Did you just go out and find them taking it
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.420]   or what? How do you think things would have played out had you politely but firmly declined?"
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.860]   Raptor responds with his experience. He says, "It varied. They were all locals and they
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.780]   did stop after fuel became available after about two weeks. Finding fuel, especially
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:05.420]   diesel, was difficult in the first two weeks. Apparently they had diesel generators. My
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:09.300]   pickup was diesel and I was carrying fuel to a generator from my building to get it
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.660]   back up on line. I made several trips over several days with about a dozen fuel jugs
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:18.500]   in the truck bed to get fuel for the generator. I later obtained several drums. I found they
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:24.300]   did not try to requisition a whole drum, probably because it weighs 500+ pounds. Five-gallon
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:28.680]   jugs on the other hand, when carried in the pickup truck bed, were easy to requisition.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.860]   They are a nice handy size. It was not done in a threatening manner, but it was clear
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.140]   that you had no choice in the matter. You could be a street attorney and protest, and
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.460]   they would give you problems and take all your fuel, or you could be a good citizen
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.100]   and give them two or three of the jugs of fuel and go on your way. They also did not
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:49.820]   have any receipts to give you for your "donation." I did ask for that once. They also did not
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.100]   give me back the empty jugs, which were even more difficult to find than diesel. I tried
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:58.100]   to trade empty for full once and was told they did not have the jugs with them, but
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:03.340]   I could come back later with more full jugs to give them. I likely gave up the fuel too
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:07.220]   easily, but I did not want any trouble from the law enforcement officers. I knew what
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.820]   happened to troublemakers. If I had made a stink about it, I probably could have kept
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:15.440]   the fuel. I can be very persuasive. However, I am also sure that would come at a price
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.900]   more than the fuel was worth at the time. My comment was that, in retrospect, it still
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:27.260]   angers me. However, I would likely do the same thing under the same circumstances.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.460]   That concludes the forum posts from this particular thread that I am going to read. Now obviously,
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:37.980]   I hope this format has not been too disjointed. I wanted to keep this in the minds, in the
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:42.820]   words of somebody who had been through Hurricane Katrina. And I had previously tried to record
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:48.260]   the show with my updating all the things that were out of date and providing commentary
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.420]   and expanding. It was just, it was too convoluted. So I've just kept this in the words of this
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:57.220]   particular poster, Raptor. And I hope that you will take the lessons or whatever the
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:03.220]   examples are from this situation and apply it, apply them to your own circumstances.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:08.140]   I will simply say this, one of the most valuable things that you can learn about Katrina or
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:17.140]   from Katrina is probably how quickly it really can happen here, wherever here is for you.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:23.940]   And it's hard to overestimate. Katrina changed the face of US government response. It was
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:31.060]   such a boondoggle on different scenarios. I remember a number of years ago, I read President
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:36.260]   Bush's, former President Bush's biography and he, autobiography and he talked about
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:44.460]   Katrina and I just, it was such a boondoggle at all levels. But when the things break down,
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:49.740]   they can break down very quickly. And so you need to be prepared for such an event. You
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:55.980]   need to be flexible in your thinking and you need to have multiple options considered.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.060]   If you run a business, think about what would happen with your businesses. Think about some
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.820]   of those things like with your employees. Can you, could you pay your employees? Do
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.460]   you have the reserves, et cetera? In your personal situation, just think about things
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:10.180]   like that. Now, chances are a hurricane like Katrina will not happen again, but there will
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:17.340]   be something else, whether it's an earthquake or a forest fire or something else that happens.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:23.020]   And those types of events can make a big, big difference. So I hope these thoughts from
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:28.140]   somebody who was through it are useful to you, from somebody who wasn't trying to publicize
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.860]   anything, wasn't trying to make a political comment, was just talking with their online
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:36.380]   friends about their experience. I hope this has been useful to you. So go out and prepare
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.420]   accordingly.
