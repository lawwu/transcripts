[00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.080]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua. I am your host. And today we continue our series related to National Preparedness Month in honor of September, which is officially here in the United States, the National Preparedness Month. And today I'm going to share with you the experiences of one man as he went through Hurricane Katrina.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.500]   - You're welcome.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.620]   - I appreciate it.

[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.300]   - Thank you.

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.480]   He was thoughtful and was prepared and it shows how money and physical preparations come together. Now you should note that some things have changed in the last more than ten years since Hurricane Katrina. Some of the technology references and such that he mentions are a little bit out of date, the technology has changed, some of the circumstances have changed, etc. I previously recorded a version of this show where I gave extensive commentary trying to give up-to-date information on this, but it became so cumbersome that I've decided to delete that and now I want to give you a little bit more information on this.

One of the most valuable things you can do is when watching the world consider the circumstances that other people are going through and then formulate your own ideas on responding to your own ideas.

Parts of it were flooded briefly through a small though a small portion was flooded due to the 17th Street Canal failure for about two weeks.

I also keep a small boat in the garage. I shut down my

[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:55.600]  , after we completed our much tested hurricane backup plan. I sent everyone home early and told them to contact me Saturday and Sunday if they decided to evacuate. I told them we would regroup Monday or Tuesday. My usual hurricane rule was enforced for my employees. That is, you will not be penalized in any way if you miss work for one or two days due to an evacuation. Little did I know that it would be three weeks before we would gather as even a partial group again. I gave a two-week pay advance to the
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:25.620]   to everyone before they left, telling everyone to be safe but to communicate with me. I normally do not do this, but since payday was next Friday and Katrina had me spooked, I did it. This two-week pay helped some lower-paid employees evacuate to safety. I kept everyone on the payroll and forgave the two-week pay advance for all. I did this to retain everybody and I was not disappointed by anybody. Most were moved and some moved to tears when we met again and regrouped. Work provided some normalcy.

I saw a single mother with a baby and toddler go without water when an alpha male barged in line and took stuff meant for her. The alpha males simply put the water in their pockets and walked away. I found her some water when the alpha males suddenly dropped their water and ran for their lives. Be compassionate but do not be silly. Sometimes sympathy targets old people and young people.

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:10.260]   If you have the slightest doubt about the water, then it is not safe to drink it. Unsafe water from the tap can be used for flushing toilets and washing clothes. It can also be used for washing you, but do not drink it and keep it away from your eyes, nose, and mouth when showering with it.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:23.680]   However, unsafe water from the tap and a 5% to 10% solution of bleach can be used for cleaning dishes with soap as long as the final rinse is in boiled or clean water. Be sure the water has cooled and add 2% or 3% bleach to the rinse water.

[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.100]   boiling pot will make quick work of producing many gallons of safe drinking water without the heat and humidity in the house. This boiling pot can also be used to sanitize plates, silverware, and pots. You can attach a large activated charcoal filter to an outside water hose to filter water that you boil for drinking. Boiling may or may not remove toxic chemicals in the water. Use bottled water from a known source if at all possible for all drinking, food preparation, washing, and bathing. Water in a pinch can be made safer by filtering it and adding a small amount of chlorine.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   The water should not be used for anything if at all possible. You may be tempted to use the dishwasher and put it on heated water in the sanitized setting, but do not take the risk. It's just not worth the risk. Plan on hand washing and sanitizing the dishes yourself. Paper towels, plates, and disposable knives and forks work very well, and many times are better than real china and silverware. Have lots of paper towels, garbage bags, and disposable stuff on hand. Garbage dispensers can be used to clean up the dishes, but they are not suitable for drinking.

Plan on bringing it to the dump yourself. Sanitation is important and garbage stinks after a week in the sun. When you bring it to the dump, put it on the trailer. Do not put it in the car or trunk. You will never get the stink out. Note, you can freeze bottles of unsafe water for ice. Just label it as unsafe and do not use or drink the water. Food is important for morale. Cook it and present it well. Sit down together and drink it.

Simple menu items are important since fresh items are limited, such as spaghetti and meatballs, red beans, rice and meat, sausage, hamburger, chicken, chicken and rice, hamburgers and macaroni and cheese, scrambled eggs, grits and toast, steak and canned veggies, jambalaya and meat of any kind. Use MREs only for lunch when out and about or as a last resort. Everybody should sit down and eat together at least once a day for better morale.
