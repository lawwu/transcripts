[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.380]   Radical Personal Finance, episode 25.
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.500]   On today's show, an interview with Jacob Lund Fisker,
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.140]   author of Early Retirement Extreme, the book and the blog.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:01:07.680]   Good morning and welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, July 22, 2014.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.400]   It's a Tuesday today all day.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.340]   And I want to thank you for being here.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000]   Today's show is one I've been looking forward to bringing you.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.620]   An interview with Jacob Lund Fisker, author of Early Retirement Extreme, the book and the blog.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.900]   And I want to thank you for being here.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.120]   I'm Jacob Lund Fisker, author of Early Retirement Extreme, the book and the blog.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.220]   And I want to thank you for being here.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.880]   And I want to thank you for being here.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.600]   Someone I'll now call my friend, Jacob Lund Fisker.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.320]   Jacob's cracked the code on how to retire, how anybody can retire in five years or fewer.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.140]   If you're interested, join us.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.980]   This is definitely an interview that I've been looking forward to.
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.700]   I've read a lot of Jacob's work over the years.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.700]   In fact, episode three of the Radical Personal Finance podcast,
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.160]   was actually an introduction and an overview, a review of his book, Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.640]   And if you go and listen to that show, you'll find that I give it an unqualified recommendation.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.160]   Absolutely.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   It should be, in my thought, it should be a must read for anybody who's interested in finance.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.460]   And so today's show is going to be an interview with Jacob,
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.040]   where we're going to go into some philosophy.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.820]   We're going to just basically have a conversation.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.500]   And I really enjoyed talking with him.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.360]   And this interview was recorded on Saturday.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.680]   And we had a good time together.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.820]   We had a very nice time together.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.500]   And a couple of notes, however, before we get started with that,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.540]   that you'll need to be aware of for the show.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.260]   And I want to talk you through.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.360]   You need to understand, prior to this conversation with Jacob,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.280]   you need to understand a little bit about the Early Retirement Extreme philosophy.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.840]   Because this interview is going to be different than many types of interviews that you would hear.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.140]   A lot of times when you hear an interview on a podcast,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.140]   you'll assume you'll hear the host,
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.640]   and you'll just ask the expert or the interviewee to kind of basically teach
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   and talk a little bit about their philosophy.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.140]   I really wasn't that interested in doing that kind of interview.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140]   And it actually worked out really well with Jacob,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.640]   because in our email correspondence before the show,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.140]   he was a little concerned.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.640]   He said, "I'm a little rusty when it comes to talking about early retirement.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640]   I don't really think about this stuff anymore."
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.140]   His blog, he's put it on autopilot for several years now.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140]   He doesn't really post much new content.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.080]   If he does, it's extremely occasional.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   He's got a widget that cycles posts through the front page.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   And his comments to me in the email thread,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   he said, "I just don't think about this stuff anymore."
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   Which to me, I think, is actually a really important consideration.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   It's just a point I want to dwell on for a moment.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   We all need to go through our transition time
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   of really understanding the in-depth nuts and bolts of something.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   But there's more to life than money.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.020]   It's hard for me to imagine still being excited about doing budgets 40 years from now,
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.020]   or being excited about some aspects of personal finance.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   Just like riding a bicycle,
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.020]   the first time you ride a bicycle,
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.020]   you're pretty thrilled with yourself that you're able to stay on two wheels.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.020]   After a while, though, just riding a bicycle,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.020]   you're more thrilled about where you're going to go and how you're going to get there.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.020]   So I think there is a very important progression that we need to understand
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.960]   in financial topics that, over time, we really should master this stuff,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   and not have a need to think more about it.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   And I think Jacob has done that.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   So a little bit about his story.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   You'll also need to understand a little bit about his philosophy and his story
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   in order to make sense of this interview.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   So I'm going to share with you a couple of things about his philosophy and about his story.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   I'm going to read just the first, a little bit short part of this,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   of his about page from his website,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.900]   because I think this is the best,
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.900]   update as far as to give you a background on who he is.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.900]   So this is from his about page,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.900]   which is from his website at earlyretirementextreme.com/about.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.900]   About me.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.900]   Current net worth in 2014, 64 years worth of annual expenses.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.900]   My name is Jacob.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.900]   My greatest claim to fame and overall impact on the world is probably this blog
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.900]   and the concept of ERE, early retirement extreme.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.900]   Before that, I used to be a nuclear astrophysicist,
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.840]   but in reality, I've done many other different and, to me, interesting things.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   And my aim is to continue this way of life for the rest of my life, never getting bored.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   ERE is much, much more than just retiring extremely early by, quote,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   sacrificing travel and expensive restaurants.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   It is effectively a philosophy of life.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   Now, you can read a summary on the Wiki, a much longer version in the book,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   or you can try to piece it together from the blog.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   But the short story is that ERE is a set of values and principles that gives me the freedom
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.780]   and opportunity to live a life I find exciting and interesting.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.780]   This quote accurately describes my philosophy of life.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.780]   Quote, "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play,
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.780]   his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.780]   He hardly knows which is which.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.780]   He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.780]   and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.720]   To himself, he always appears to be doing both."
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   Francois-René de Chateaubriand.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   In contrast to Chateaubriand, most people separate their work and entertainment
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.720]   and refer to it as their work-life balance.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   They go to work doing their one specialization so that they can afford to be entertained
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   at an expensive restaurant, a ball game, or by traveling to some tourist location
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   and engaging in entertainment activities as a consumer.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.660]   Concentrating on just one thing, like a specific career, all one's life, and engaging in other activities
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.660]   at the spectator level would actually bore me somewhat.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.660]   I don't think humans obey the law of comparative advantage well.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.660]   At least I don't.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.660]   Here's another one of my favorite quotes:
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.660]   "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, con a ship,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.660]   design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.600]   take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   program a computer, cook a tasty meal, and do whatever you want to do."
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.620]   "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.600]   start a new problem, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   Specialization is for insects."
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   Robert A. Heinlein
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   That's very different from "A human being should go get a job to get money to buy a house and car
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   and go out to eat at restaurants and play tourist a couple of weeks each year."
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   I engage in almost everything with the aim to get good at it.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   To me, it's more fun to score a goal by top shelving the puck in the local hockey league
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   than watching the Blackhawks while eating a hot dog in the stands.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.540]   That's just my preference. I'm not a good spectator.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.540]   Mastering things is highly entertaining to me.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.540]   I like becoming and being good at things.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.540]   Sometimes this leads to people willing to pay me. Sometimes it doesn't.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.540]   For the first 30 years of my life, I was lucky to have people pay me for doing what I thought was the most interesting thing in the world:
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.540]   researching arcane details about Neutron Start.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:09.540]   At 30, I became financially independent, and therefore I no longer have to resort to luck.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.480]   Because I'm now financially independent, I don't have to care what other people are willing to pay me.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   But that doesn't stop me from trying to get better at what interests me,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   from doing the right things or helping people, or even from making money if I can.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   On the whole, I have fully internalized the ERE philosophy you read on these pages.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   I think this way naturally and automatically. I walk the talk.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   I don't think of my choices as a sacrifice any more than a toddler who has learned how to walk thinks of having sacrificed crawling around.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.420]   At this point, 2014, I have enough saved to continue this lifestyle,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.420]   for the next 64 years, and my passive income is twice as large as I need.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.420]   And he goes on into his background and his history.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.420]   So that should give you a little bit of an insight into his philosophy.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.420]   And you need to understand his philosophy to understand this interview.
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.420]   You also might want to consider listening first, if you haven't, to my review of Early Retirement Extreme,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   the book, which is found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/3. It's episode 3.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.360]   And if you listen to that review, you'll get an idea of the following:
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   The philosophy behind the book, with some extensive passages that I read and commented.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   Forgive the audio. That was back in the handheld voice recorder days of the show.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   So I would encourage you to consider that.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   And that will help this interview to make a lot more sense.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.360]   Because we don't really talk much about the practical realities of the financial planning world with Jacob.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   We talk more about just philosophy and have a conversation.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.300]   In essence, if I were to summarize the Early Retirement Extreme philosophy, I would say,
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   "You need to look through the fallacy of the work-to-earn-to-buy system that we currently live under."
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   Work at one thing so that you can earn enough to buy everything else in life.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   See through that system.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   Develop skills that will allow you to end that loop, where you're able to step out of that cycle
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   and provide the needs for yourself with skills that don't require just simply the skill of being a consumer and spending money.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.240]   This skill development, skill acquisition,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   allows you to save a massive percentage of your income.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   Ideally, 70 to 80% or more or less, just depending on how you're able to do it.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   But by saving 70 to 80% or more of your income, and by replacing the need to buy with the goal for skill,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   then it allows one to be in the situation where you're able to retire in a very short period of time.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   Say, five to seven years, something like that.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.180]   And this is done, there's two parts to that equation.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:50.180]   It's the high savings rate, but it's also the fact that by eliminating a lot of the need for money through skill acquisition,
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:57.180]   you're able to maintain that lifestyle going forward, and in Jacob's terms, not sacrifice anything that's important to you.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:03.180]   So that's an introduction to the interview, and I hope that is helpful for you.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.180]   Two quick technical notes before I start the interview for you.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:13.120]   Number one is a couple of quick notes about my interview style.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   I have a lengthy interview, and if I want to watch a three-minute interview with somebody, I can go watch CNBC.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   I don't have any interest in those types of interviews.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   And if I know the background of somebody, then I really don't have much interest, me personally, in hearing their background.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   I'm more interested in having a conversation with them and just talking about things that are interesting between us.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.060]   So with this interview, and I actually really enjoyed it more than anything,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.060]   I think I had more than some conversations I've had.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:53.060]   But with this interview, I didn't have any desire to ask him lots and lots about his history and explain the whole philosophy.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.060]   The man's written a book on it.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.060]   There's no reason to go into that kind of conversation.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.060]   Why, if somebody has spent weeks and months of their life pouring everything they think into a book,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.060]   why would I not just do them the dignity of spending a few hours reading their book?
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:13.000]   And that's what they've struggled to articulate.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   They've struggled to articulate their entire philosophy.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So this interview is not a CNBC interview.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's not a professional, "Here are my 30 minutes of questions."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   It's a conversation, and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   This is the type of content that I enjoy.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I have to overcome a little bit of my insecurity of not doing what everyone else does,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   because it seems as though these types of interviews, these types of in-depth, lengthy conversations,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.940]   are not popular in the press, and they're certainly not popular in the podcasting world.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   But this is the type of thing that I enjoy,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.940]   the content that I like.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.940]   So I'm interested in your feedback.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.940]   If you like it as well, let me know.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.940]   This is the type of thing that when I was out looking for financial podcasts,
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.940]   this is the type of thing that I was always looking for.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   Not for a beautifully structured 30-minute conversation to understand what someone's book is about.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.940]   I wanted to hear from the person.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.940]   I really get to know the person.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.940]   And I really think that we've accomplished that in the interview today.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.940]   The second procedural note, we were on Skype,
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.940]   and especially towards the end of the call,
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.880]   we had some major Skype connection issues,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   and we all ended up disconnecting at least a half a dozen times,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.880]   which was a real challenge.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   I have edited the file,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   so most of those disconnection times will not actually be obvious to you.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   However, you may find a couple of them.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   If you hear Jacob repeat himself on something,
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   or if it seems a little bit wonky,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   just assume that that was a place where I had to cut out the disconnect,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   and then we picked up the conversation and tried to continue the theme as well as possible.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.820]   And with that, here's my interview with Jacob Lund Fisker,
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.820]   of the book and blog Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:51.820]   Well, Jacob, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   I'm thrilled that you're here.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   I've been looking forward to this conversation, so welcome.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.820]   Well, thank you very much.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   I'm glad to be here, et cetera.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.820]   So I'd like to start and just give you kind of an opportunity.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.820]   In the introduction, I've given a little bit of background.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.820]   And if anyone wants details on your life,
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.760]   we're going to assume that the listeners have listened to my other show that I did,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.760]   reviewing your book called Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.760]   And we're going to assume that if they're looking for details,
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   they can find that on your website.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   But would you give just a quick background on kind of how did you become the Early Retirement Extreme guy?
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   What was your story?
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.760]   Where did you come from and how did you become known as Mr. Early Retirement Extreme?
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:42.700]   So with respect to the blog, for instance, I used to have an account on MySpace.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.700]   Back before Facebook, so many, many years ago.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.700]   And I started writing these blog posts.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.700]   I really had no idea what a blog post was.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.700]   And I was writing on all kinds of different subjects.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.700]   And at one point, I don't know, it probably happened pretty randomly,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.700]   and I started Googling around on the rest of the Internet for people who were writing.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.700]   And I found that there was an actual thing called blogs on the real Internet.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.640]   And I found a blog.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   It was a personal finance blog, which was Lazy Man and Money.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   And that seemed pretty interesting to be able to write about personal finance,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   especially since I had somewhat of a background in that field already at that point,
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   namely that I was practically financially independent.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:40.580]   And I figured that by starting a real blog, I could reach an audience that was somewhat bigger
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.580]   than maybe my 50 MySpace friends.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.580]   So that's pretty much how it got started.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   I mean, other than that, I mean, at that point, it was kind of just kind of built as I went along.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.580]   There weren't very many personal finance blogs back then.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.580]   They kind of come in waves.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.580]   I mean, the first ones probably started like in 2002, 2003.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   And then I kind of divided into like three-year slots.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:12.520]   And then maybe the next wave, which is where some of the biggest ones, I think,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   like Get Rich Slowly, et cetera, they start around 2004, 2005, 2006.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   And then I came in like in the third wave, which was 2007, 2008-ish.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.520]   And then you have like the fourth wave, 2010 and onwards, and the fifth wave and so on.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.520]   So I kind of forget where I was going with all that.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.520]   It's certainly a fascinating world.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:42.460]   I have similar memories is that I'm trying to remember what was the first like personal finance blog that I used to read.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.460]   I remember reading Get Rich Slowly was J.D. Roth's project.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.460]   I remember reading that right from the very beginning.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.460]   I don't even know how I stumbled across it.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.460]   Yeah, The Simple Dollar.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.460]   I don't know even.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.460]   I think Trent was the author there.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.460]   I don't know if he sold that or if he's still writing it.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:06.460]   I think it was a similar solution to J.D. in that he sold it, but he is still writing.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.460]   Okay.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.460]   He doesn't like editing.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.400]   But I mean.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   I guess my point was that I kind of started the blog without really having read much in terms of personal finance blogs.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   I mean I've probably been reading for like two weeks or something.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   It's like, okay, what should I call this?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   Well, maybe something with early retirement since I kind of had the impression of myself that I figured the system out and everything.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   And then I just kind of like, okay, like retirement extreme sounds pretty good.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:42.340]   That's kind of like during the era where they had all these extreme shows on TV, on the radio.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.340]   And then I kind of like where the name came from.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:52.340]   And that's kind of come back to bite me because like people have a lot of strong preconceptions of what retirement should be.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.340]   I mean if I had to do that all over again, I would have called it like something completely unrelated.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.340]   Just like my name or I keep saying I would call it like Muckluck or something or Penguin or whatever.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:12.280]   Just to sort of have some more intellectual freedom in terms of what you can say on the blog without people having any kind of prejudices.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   I mean I think that's the way it should be.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   Right, right.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   Well, I'd like to talk about that for a minute because to me that's an important topic is that in general and I know you've written on this.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   But in general, when people talk about retirement, they have this idea of playing for 40 years, the stereotypical.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   I live in Florida so we have plenty of golf courses.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.220]   So the idea is I'm going to go golfing every day and go fishing every day and I'm just going to play for 40 years.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:49.220]   So we work until we're 65 and then we quit and then we retire for 30 years and we never do anything productive again.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.220]   And this is the image that people have of retirement.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:58.220]   And I just like to point out that the emperor has no clothes on and be the one to point it out.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.220]   I'm sure you'll join me in that.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   Nobody does that.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.220]   Even though everyone thinks they're supposed to do that, nobody does that.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:12.160]   So in the past when I've done financial planning, I'd find the majority of my clients will never be able to afford to retire because they're not really that committed.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   And the people who can afford to retire don't retire in that sense.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   So the idea of retirement being I'm just going to – I don't remember what age you were when you considered yourself retired or financially independent or whatever word you want to use.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:34.160]   Well, I was financially independent when I was 30 but I was still working in physics at that point and pursuing an actual career.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.160]   I stopped doing that when I was 33 and that's kind of like the cutoff date that I would consider.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.100]   Right.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.100]   And I'm not going to be any longer pursuing any kind of like 40-year work plan.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.100]   Right.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:57.100]   And this idea that you're supposed to turn 30 and then you're supposed to, what, golf every day for the next 65 years of your life?
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.100]   I mean it's utterly foolish.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:06.100]   It's like quite restrictive in terms of like – I coined the term internet retirement police at one point.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.100]   Right.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   And it kind of got popular.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.040]   And there's like a bunch of people on the internet who like to sort of specify what you allow.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.040]   Right.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   And what you're not allowed to and what you're not allowed to do.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   And I mean one of the funny things is I mean after three years, two years of – when I was 35, I actually went back and got a real job again in a field that's always fascinated me.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:41.980]   And there was like a bunch of people who were like really upset because they had sort of now put me in the pigeonhole of me as someone who was supposed to be retired and therefore I was not really allowed to have freedom that I pretty much –
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:42.980]   Right.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.980]   I mean I spent the past five, ten years of my life building up.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.980]   I was not supposed to have that.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.980]   See what I mean?
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.980]   Right.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:21:11.920]   And but I mean it's – the kind of thing I really want to talk – really want to promote is not so much like the traditional sense of life prescription where retirement is at the end but building up the freedom to do like many different things to sort of like interact with people.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   Right.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   Right.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.920]   Well, the thing that I like to point out and it took me a while to learn this because when I was a kid, I would read all of these personal financial books, personal finance books.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.920]   And the main thing that – I mean I consumed hundreds of these books that all said the same thing.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.920]   Look, Joshua, if you'll just start saving it and early enough, you're going to be able to save it.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920]   Right.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.920]   Right.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   Right.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   Right.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   Right.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   Right.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   Right.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   Right.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   Right.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   Right.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   And I think that's kind of what I'm aiming at.
