[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.120]   the book of the prophet Isaiah in the fifth chapter, reading verses 22 and 23.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   Verses 22 and 23 in the fifth chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.840]   Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.520]   which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.520]   him.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.240]   which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.800]   him.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.760]   We are looking here at the sixth and the last of the words that were pronounced by the prophet
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.000]   Jeremiah upon his contemporaries.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.120]   You remember, those of you who attend here regularly week by week will be well aware
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.120]   of this fact.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.000]   I put it again for the sake of those who may be here for the first time or who may not
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.080]   have heard our previous consideration of the message of this chapter.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.360]   You will remember that here the prophet is delivering one of his great messages to the
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   nation.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.860]   He had been called of God to do so.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.560]   It was not his own meditation upon the situation that made him speak.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   No prophet ever spoke of himself.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.440]   No prophet ever spoke the result of his own cogitation.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   No prophecy of Scripture, as Peter puts it in the second epistle in the first chapter
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.960]   at the end, no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.200]   That doesn't mean we can't interpret it privately.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.760]   It means that it never came into being privately.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.920]   It's not a man's private interpretation.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.640]   It isn't a great philosopher.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.720]   It isn't a seer looking at the position and then meditating upon it and coming to conclusions
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   and then speaking.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.520]   That's not prophecy.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.960]   Prophecy is a message given by God to one of his servants, to men who he called and
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   who he prepared, sometimes to very reluctant servants.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.040]   Jeremiah, for instance, was a most reluctant servant.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040]   He didn't want to speak.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.000]   It gave him no pleasure at all.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.640]   God, in a sense, had to force him to speak, had to put fire into his bones through the
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640]   word.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.720]   And it's exactly the same with Isaiah.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.400]   He had received a message.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.680]   God gave him a message to deliver to the people.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   Why?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.080]   Well, because they were going astray, they were going wrong, and they were beginning
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   to get into trouble.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.840]   And there was still greater trouble looming on the horizon and threatening to come ever
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.960]   nearer and nearer.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.640]   That's why the prophet spoke.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.720]   That's why all the prophets spoke.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.400]   God sends prophets to men, individuals, and to nations because of his love.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.320]   Here the prophet puts his message in the form of woes, but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.200]   The object of the woes is to call them to repentance, to warn them, to urge them to
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.760]   escape, to repent and to come back.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.160]   It's most important that we should always bear this in mind.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720]   The whole purpose, I say, of God in raising up prophets, giving them a message, and sending
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.400]   them to the people, is that the people may be saved from disaster, from the consequences
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.120]   of their own fall.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.760]   And here we've been looking at this great message.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.240]   And we are doing so, of course, not because we are animated by any merely historical or
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.440]   antiquarian interest.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.660]   Although, if you really want to do something intelligent and interesting, there's nothing
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.280]   better than to consider the story and the case of the children of Israel.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.720]   Much more exciting than any detective novel, much more exciting than anything fictional,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.960]   the actual history of these people, and read it and see what happened to them.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.360]   But we are not doing it for that reason.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.520]   And I'll tell you why we're not doing it for that reason.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   We can't afford such luxuries.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.440]   We are in too much trouble ourselves.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.320]   I'm calling attention to it because, as I've been trying to show, it provides us with such
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.460]   a perfect parallel of our own exact position at the present time.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.080]   These things keep on recurring.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   We are living in a world of trouble.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.600]   You needn't have come here to hear that, you know that.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.440]   That's why you're here.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.360]   The world is in terrible trouble.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.960]   And so many of our problems are due to the fact that we know that.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.400]   And some panic, and some feel utter despair.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.720]   Here it is.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.480]   Well, now, what can we do?
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.200]   Our business is to listen to this message of God through his prophet.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.560]   Because this message is always contemporary, it's always up to date.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.680]   And as we've been going through it, we've seen more and more clearly that we might very
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.800]   well be listening to a word that is addressed to us at this present hour.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.960]   And here we come tonight to the last of these woes, pronounced by the prophet in these extraordinary
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.560]   words that I've just read out to you.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.040]   Now, some may think that this is a repetition of what he said previously in the second woe,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.680]   or in the fourth woe.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.160]   We read in the second woe, "Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.080]   may follow strong drink, that continue until night, till wine inflame them."
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.640]   Or, you may think that it's got something to do with the fourth of these woes.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.920]   "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.320]   for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter."
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.280]   On the surface it may sound as if the sixth woe is just a repetition and a kind of combination
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.320]   of those two previous woes.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.480]   But I want to try to show you that it isn't that.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.120]   It's got an element, of course, which is the same, but it goes much further.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.720]   It carries the analysis of the condition of the children of Israel right to its highest
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   point.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.120]   For what we are dealing with in these two verses is the manifestation of the sin of
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:49.920]   Israel in her greatest leaders, in her judges, in those in the highest positions who are
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:07:00.560]   guilty not only of giving way to drink, but also to injustice and a loss of a moral sense.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:10.960]   So that's the position here, licentiousness and injustice in the highest quarters.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.040]   In other words, these two verses must, of course, be taken together.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.760]   The woe is pronounced upon men who are guilty of these two things.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.960]   And as I want to try to show you, these two things go together.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now as we look at these woes, and we must summarize them as we are looking at this last
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.320]   one, we must have been struck and impressed by the protean character of sin.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.880]   It's a terrible disease, sin, its symptoms are almost endless in number.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's the great message that comes out in the Bible, men in a condition of sin, what
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.680]   he's capable of, and the variety of the manifestations.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.560]   We've had a collection of them here, but it's all due to the same thing.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.800]   It's all produced by fundamentally the same thing.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.240]   There is nothing more extraordinary about sin than just that.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.160]   And of course, it is because of this character, this varied character, or the variety in the
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.600]   manifestations of sin, that people so often don't recognize it as sin at all.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   Our tendency, all of us by nature, is to regard certain things only as sin.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.640]   And we're not aware that other things that seem to be so different are equally sinful.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.560]   For instance, take the way it's put in the Gospels.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:43.880]   You've got two classes of people having dealings with our Lord, publicans and sinners, Pharisees
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.340]   and scribes.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.260]   And you feel at first that there's nothing common to them.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.240]   And yet, you see, the whole point of our Lord's teaching was to show that both classes were
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.080]   equally sinful.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.880]   And that's what infuriated the Pharisees.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.760]   They recognized that the publicans and the sinners and the harlots were sinners, of course.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.600]   Everybody knew that they were sinners.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.880]   But the Pharisees never imagined that they were sinners, that they were suffering from
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.600]   essentially the same disease.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   Why not?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.120]   Well, because they didn't produce those particular symptoms.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.780]   They hadn't got those particular manifestations.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:27.880]   But this one self-same disease can produce quite different symptoms and manifestations.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:37.720]   In other words, self-righteousness is as much a manifestation of sin as is profligacy and
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.040]   riotous living.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.000]   Both of them are manifestations of the same essential condition.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.840]   Because you see, sin ultimately is a wrong relationship to God.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.320]   And it doesn't matter what form it takes.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.240]   As long as it is a wrong relationship to God, it is sin.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.360]   It may be highly respectable.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.580]   It may be shameful and obviously disgraceful.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.080]   It doesn't make the slightest difference, not a bit.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.840]   Indeed, I could put up a very good case for arguing that in the sight of God, respectable
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.800]   sin is much more terrible than the other.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.640]   But the point I'm making is that we are shown here how sin in all its subtlety can be so
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.400]   involved, can be so variegated as it were in its manifestations, so much so that it
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.360]   eludes us and deludes us and makes us think that we are not sinners at all.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   So the prophet, in the wisdom given to him by God, he doesn't just say you're sinners.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.700]   He says you're sinning in this respect and that and that and that.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:50.240]   He shows the wide character, he brings it home and he shows how it's common.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.240]   That has come out, I think, very clearly.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.280]   And another thing has come out very clearly and that is the terrible power of sin.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.920]   And this is the thing I want to deal with this evening because it seems to me that this
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.880]   is the thing of everything else that is not being understood at the present time.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.080]   And seems to me, therefore, to be the main cause of most of our present troubles, the
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.360]   power of sin.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   It comes out particularly strikingly in this last of the worlds.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.840]   Of course the popular idea about sin is that, well, in fact they don't like the term at
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   all.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.520]   The whole notion of sin has been hated in this present century.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.260]   I'm really amused to see some men who have spent most of their lives in pulpits denouncing
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.440]   the biblical teaching of sin, now getting rather excited at the manifestations of the
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.720]   sin that they've denounced for so long as it's appearing in a social manner in this
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   country.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.320]   If it were not so desperately serious and tragic, it would indeed be really funny.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.560]   And I could spend my evening here in just showing you how utterly ludicrous it is.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.240]   They have never understood the power of sin.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.320]   They have told us you shouldn't say that sin is something positive.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.240]   What you mean is that certain qualities are lacking.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.680]   You mustn't say a man's bad.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.840]   What you should say is that he isn't good.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.520]   Well, that's how it's put.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.120]   You mustn't say it's positive.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.240]   It's a negation.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.940]   It's the absence of qualities.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.840]   So you see, they say that mankind has been misled throughout the centuries by this biblical
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.360]   teaching concerning sin.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.280]   It's simply that man isn't fully developed yet.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.560]   It's like a child who doesn't realize what he'll come to know later and grow up and he'll
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   stop doing certain things.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.160]   It's a characteristic of the infancy of the human race.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.560]   And therefore, it's something that we have to be patient with.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.020]   We don't denounce it.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.200]   We don't pronounce woes upon it like Isaiah did.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   That's so terrible.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.000]   This God of the Old Testament, whom they so hate and pronounce it because he pronounces
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.920]   woes and judgment.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   They don't like that.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   No, no, no.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.800]   You've just got to be patient and you've got to show people the beautiful.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:13.480]   So you give them pictures of the beautiful and you tell them affecting and sentimental
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:19.820]   stories and you do it perhaps with a sentimental affective voice and you play with colored
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.580]   lights and try to produce a psychological effect and make people feel nice and comfortable
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.320]   and happy and so they'll soon be living better lives.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:37.600]   But now, the very teachers of this false doctrine are themselves beginning to get alarmed as
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.560]   they see the breakdown of morals more and more evident day after day and week after
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.160]   week and month after month.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.440]   No, no, my friends.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.920]   I say it again.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:54.040]   The most powerful force in the world tonight next to the power of God is the power of the
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.840]   devil, is the power of sin.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   Sin is the most powerful thing in the universe next to God.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.240]   You talk about your atomic power.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.280]   It's nothing by the side of sin.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:17.480]   I know the explosion of an atomic bomb can bring much chaos and calamity, but look what
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.640]   sin has done to the human race.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.560]   Here has been the greatest power in the life of men that has brought him to his wretchedness
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:32.080]   so constantly and threatens finally to engulf men in an ultimate and a final disaster.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   No, no.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.800]   Sin is not negative.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.120]   Sin is not the absence of something.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.840]   So sin can't be dealt with easily by education and moral exhortation.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.560]   Sin can't be solved by setting up more royal commissions, but that's what they're still
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.160]   proposing, isn't it?
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.640]   You've been reading about the BMA report this week, haven't you?
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.800]   These facts have been known for a number of years.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.400]   Here's a committee that's been sitting for two years and it's brought out its report.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   All this has been reported by medical officers of health.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:08.040]   These venereal diseases are increasing with a terrible rapidity in this country and in
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.840]   all the countries.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   What can they do about it?
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.400]   Oh, they want to call a conference.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.240]   The educational authorities and the sociologists must come together and the church.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   Those who teach morality in the church, that's what the church is, the place where morality
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   is taught.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.880]   They must all come together and devise some scheme whereby this can be dealt with.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:36.960]   You see, the whole trouble is due to the fact that they've never realized the power of sin,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.160]   the greatest power in the universe apart from the power of God.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.440]   We are, you see, in a world in which these two great powers are fighting a battle and
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.960]   for the soul of man, for you and for me.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.360]   We are not fighting some academic or theoretical problem.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.840]   The matter I'm raising tonight is not of theoretical interest.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.760]   My dear friends, we're all involved in this.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.320]   There are parents who are involved in this with their children in trouble.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.200]   The children themselves are involved in it.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.360]   Young lives are being ruined and terrible things are happening and worse things can
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   happen.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.880]   We are all involved in this.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.320]   So I say the essence of wisdom is to listen to the biblical message in order that we may
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.640]   learn something together of the awful, terrible power of sin.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.560]   Now I want to show you that in terms of this last of the wars because it is, as I say,
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.840]   brought out here in a particularly striking manner.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:44.400]   The first thing we are told is this, sin is no respecter of persons.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.240]   That's been another great fallacy, hasn't it?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.680]   People used to think, as it were, that you only had sin in the east end of London.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.120]   But sin is as common in the west end of London as it is in the east.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.040]   The truth about sin is that it's common everywhere.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.720]   There is nowhere where you don't get it.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.200]   Here, you see, we are told that it affects the highest in the land, the judges, the men
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:16.720]   to whom you should look up for righteousness and for equity and for a just opinion.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   It affects them.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.640]   Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   him.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:38.240]   Now that he puts it like that in terms, of course, of his own civilization, some eight
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.300]   centuries before the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.320]   But we are going to look at this in its contemporary form.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.900]   Here, I say then, we are shown so plainly and clearly that sin is no respecter of persons
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.480]   at all.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.320]   And that if you think you can divide men and women up into those who are sinners and those
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.760]   who are not sinners, and that those who are not sinners are in that position because they
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.620]   belong to a certain class or because of their birth or because of their ability or because
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:16.280]   of their education, you are guilty of the greatest fallacy of all.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.500]   For the message here is that none is immune to the power of sin.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.720]   No one has a natural immunity to sin.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.960]   No one can acquire an immunity to sin.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   Nobody.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   Sin is so powerful that it can attack the biggest and the mightiest and bring them down.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   Now the Bible is full of that.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:44.200]   Of course, some of these moderns, they don't like the Old Testament.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.400]   And they don't like the Old Testament because they say it isn't quite a decent book.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   We are told about David committing adultery and murder.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.360]   You can't show things like that to your children.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.040]   So these modern men in 1964, they can't touch it.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   They're so pure.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   But why does the Bible tell us about the adultery of David?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.360]   I'll tell you.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.880]   It is to show you the power of sin.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:16.680]   He is the king of Israel and a great man at that and a mighty warrior and a great psalmist,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.280]   a wonderful poet.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.120]   But sin got him down.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.160]   Thank God for an honest book.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.680]   Here's your BMA report, anti-dated by many centuries, and all your other reports.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.280]   There's nothing new in all this.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.520]   My dear friends, when are we going to wake up?
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   When are we going to become adult?
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.000]   When are we going to start reading the Bible, if it were merely for its history, and cease
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.960]   to think of ourselves as if we were some special people because we live in the post-war world
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.760]   and in the atomic age?
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:52.800]   When are we going to think and become men and face the facts of history?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:01.840]   And here is the great record that sin attacks everybody, that nobody is immune to sin.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.520]   What do you say?
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.320]   Do you mean by that that a man's ability doesn't matter, that a man's education doesn't count,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.240]   and his birth and upbringing make no matter?
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.360]   All I say is this, all they do is to modify the manifestations a little bit.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.440]   The thing remains, the disease is there, the symptoms can be manipulated.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.660]   We are good at medicating symptoms, but we are very poor at treating the disease.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.480]   The thing itself remains exactly the same.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.600]   Nobody is immune to sin, high and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.000]   All are victims of sin.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.200]   Learning, knowledge, education are nothing but a cloak.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.400]   The heart of men remains what it was.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.320]   The rank is but the guinea stamp.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.200]   A man's a man for all that.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   Quite right.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.920]   Poor Robert Burns, he knew it.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.400]   He knew it in himself, he knew it was true of others.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.560]   The rank is but the guinea stamp.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.600]   We bury the dress.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.120]   We sin in evening dress rather than in rags, and we think it's different.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.680]   Thus we fool ourselves.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.440]   Thus humanity and civilization goes on fooling itself because the clothing is different.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.640]   The heart, the thing itself, is the thing that matters, and that is the same in all
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   types.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.120]   Here are the judges of Israel gone wrong, the learned men, the men of whom you could
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.480]   expect something better.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.800]   But sin is no respecter of person.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:43.640]   I shall never forget the shock that I first received many years ago when, as a young professional
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:52.920]   man, I had the privilege of attending a dinner party of learned men in a certain profession.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:22:00.240]   And to my amazement, I know that I've still recovered from it, I heard these able men,
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:11.600]   in prominent positions, spending their time in repeating supposed so-called jokes.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.840]   I didn't expect it in such circles.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.160]   I foolishly hadn't understood this message.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.960]   I thought that it was only a certain class of person who did that sort of thing.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.360]   I thought you got that in the bar parlors of life.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.880]   I thought you got that sort of thing amongst the illiterate and the uneducated.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   I thought you got that amongst farm laborers and people like that.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:40.800]   But here I was suddenly listening to it in these learned circles, spending their time
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:47.200]   repeating things which the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians told us should
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   not be repeated.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   And I remember another occasion.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:58.600]   I'm only giving you these things to illustrate it, my dear friends.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.920]   I've only been in Claridge's Hotel twice in my life.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.160]   And the first time I was in Claridge's, it was at a dinner again.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.320]   I was invited for one reason only, that I had certain peculiar information which could
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   be conveyed to the gathering.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.280]   It was a gathering of thirty men only, who had been very carefully selected.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.560]   And there we first had dinner, and then the speeches came.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.480]   But this is what I want to tell you.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.160]   Again I had a shock.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   The man sitting on my right, a highly qualified expert professional man, was literally during
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:41.080]   the dinner, sick upon the floor.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.040]   Now you see, sin is no respecter of persons.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.000]   That's the point I'm trying to establish and to put to you.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.920]   And you can look at your life today in the highest circles, in the highest professional
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.320]   circles, I don't care what your profession is.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.400]   You can go to Oxford and you can go to Cambridge, which were founded originally as Christian
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.520]   institutions to teach men to live as men.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:16.000]   And you can find sin rampant, not only amongst the undergraduates, but amongst their teachers.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.800]   There is nowhere where you don't find it.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.880]   Everything that civilization has ever produced has the slightest effect upon sin.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   I say that deliberately.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.960]   Civilization has been man's attempt to overcome the problem of sin.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.720]   It doesn't put it like that, of course, because it doesn't believe in sin, but that's what
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.640]   it's been doing.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.380]   Civilization is trying to produce order out of the chaos, trying to lessen and to mitigate
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.840]   certain wrongs and injustices and suffering.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.400]   But everything that civilization has tried to do up to date has completely failed to
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.720]   deal with this terrible power of sin.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.120]   For it is something that affects even the most cultured, the most educated men, the
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.880]   men in the highest positions from whom you'd expect something better.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:11.840]   But the highest can swear like troopers and use the same foul language as the poor Tom,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:18.440]   Dick and Harry in the street.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.680]   Very well, I say, this is the vital matter for us to realize, that sin is as powerful
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.720]   as death, that there's no respect of persons in sin.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:34.040]   And we must get rid of this notion once and forever, that anything that man can do can
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   deal with sin.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   It can't.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:42.240]   That, as I've reminded you, was the essential sin of Pharisees.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.680]   But let me hurry on to my second point.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.040]   The power of sin is also shown in this way.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:58.440]   Not only that it affects all and that none are immune, but sin also makes a man insult
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   his own nature.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.920]   That's the terrible thing about sin.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:11.000]   It makes man insult his own nature, his own self, his own true greatness and blah.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Where do I find that?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.240]   Well, it comes out in a very striking way in these two verses.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.480]   Look, for instance, at the way, at what rather, men boast of.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.920]   Now this is a very remarkable saying, this.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:30.480]   "Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink."
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:41.240]   Another translation is this, "Woe unto them who are hearers at drink and strong in mixing
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   wine."
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:50.960]   Hearers at drink and strong in mixing wine.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.560]   This is a tremendous indictment of those who are guilty of sin.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.760]   In other words, I say, look at what sin makes a man boast of.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.640]   What's a man proud of?
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.440]   What does he regard as real strength, something of which he can boast?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:15.400]   Well the answer is, as it was in the time of the prophet Isaiah, so it is today.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   What is man proud of?
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.800]   He's got faculties, he's got powers, he's got a brain, he's got ability, he's got physical
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   strength.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   What's he proud of?
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:29.280]   Well, one of the things he's most proud of today is his knowledge of drink.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.640]   Now this isn't romancing.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.200]   One of the most popular men who ever appears on the television in this country never fails
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.160]   to boast about his drinking, never.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.500]   You know to whom I'm referring.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.960]   He doesn't believe in God, he ridicules Christianity.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.280]   What does he boast of?
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.920]   These sophisticated men of the world, what is to him good living?
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.880]   Well he told us one night on the television.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.240]   What is the essence of good living?
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:06.040]   His answer was this, good food and then with a smile, good drink.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.720]   Good food, good drink, that's the good life, that's the real life, this is the cultivated,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.720]   the cultured life.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.760]   He boasts as so many of them do.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.920]   This has become the thing to do, your knowledge of drinking.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:25.480]   If you don't know what particular wine to have with particular courses in your meal,
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:30.120]   you're a fool, you're an ignoramus, you don't know, you haven't arrived, you're not with
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   it.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   Where are you?
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.440]   You don't fancy not knowing what to have with fish, with the fish course, not knowing what
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   to have with the meat.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.240]   My dear sir, where are you, where do you live, where's your mind, where's your education,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.360]   where'd you come from?
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.320]   This is the way in which you estimate and judge a man, his knowledge of drink.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.080]   Ah yes, listen, there's the other element I want to show you, I went up to date Isaiah
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.200]   is men of strength to mingle strong drink.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   What do they boast of?
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.440]   Now I'm not talking as I say again of the men in the street, I'm talking about men to
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.320]   whom we should look up as leaders.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   What do they boast of?
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:15.600]   They boast of this, they know how to mix a cocktail, mixing strong drink, mixing, the
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.120]   very same term, mixing a cocktail.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:24.200]   Here's the thing, everybody doesn't know how to do it, how to mix a cocktail.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.640]   This is the thing to boast of, this is the thing that makes a man a man, this is the
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.120]   mark of sophistication, mixing a cocktail.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   And what else?
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:40.000]   Ah yes, there are men of strength to mingle strong drink, they are mighty to drink wine.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.760]   How do you estimate a man's strength?
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.440]   The strength of a man, not an animal, but the strength of a man.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   How do you estimate it?
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.560]   I'll tell you, the modern way of estimating the strength of a man is this.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   How much can he drink?
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.920]   Can he carry his liquor as a gentleman?
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.880]   That's the way you estimate strength.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.320]   I'm not romancing, these are sheer facts.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:09.000]   I've heard distinguished men, able men, boasting of the amount they could drink, that they
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.440]   were the last to remain on their seats when the others had fallen to the floor.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.880]   This was something to boast of.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.480]   Don't laugh at it, my dear friend.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   Don't laugh at that.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.240]   There are things to laugh at, but not that.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.280]   Never laugh at drunkenness.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.400]   Never laugh at a drunken man.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.520]   There is more havoc and misery wrought in this world tonight by that than by anything
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   else.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.880]   Don't laugh at that.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.160]   They boast of this.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.520]   Can he carry his liquor like a gentleman?
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.400]   That's the definition of a gentleman.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.320]   Strong to drink, he can stand it, he can stand up to it.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.040]   So he drinks and drinks and drinks, but he can still stand.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.800]   He's the greatest, he's the strongest.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   That's what they boast of.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.600]   They were doing it at this time.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.240]   Woe is pronounced on that kind of thing.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   What else?
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.640]   Well, you notice here that sin in this way makes a man insult his own nature in that
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.320]   he obviously fails to find pleasure without indulging in these artificial stimulants and
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   aids.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.240]   Why do people do this sort of thing?
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.720]   They do it because they're miserable without it.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.240]   They have failed to find happiness.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.280]   They have failed to find peace.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.000]   They have failed to find pleasure even.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.920]   This is to me the most astonishing thing and the most insulting thing to human nature.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.040]   We are being told that you cannot be convivial without drink, that you've got to be loosened
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   up.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.680]   Are men such that he cannot be convivial, he cannot be pleasant, he cannot be happy,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.800]   except he's under the influence of drugs?
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.960]   But that is the position.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.920]   It shows the utter bankruptcy and the utter emptiness of life without God and without
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   Christ.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.580]   They can't live without stimulants.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.440]   So you get your cocktails, your pep pills, and these other things, hashish and others,
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.640]   that they're smoking in Oxford and in Cambridge, in the seats of learning.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.960]   To get a kick out of it, they say.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   Why?
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.080]   Well, because they're so miserable, because they're so unhappy, because they're so completely
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.880]   bankrupt.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.960]   In the name of human nature, I protest.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.080]   Man hasn't sunk so low that he can't find pleasure, except he drugs himself and bombards
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.320]   his brain and insults himself.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.760]   But this is the thing, and then that they should take pleasure in this kind of thing
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.680]   and burst of it and think it's wonderful.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:38.520]   And it all results, as I was saying the other Sunday evening, from knocking out the highest
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.840]   centers of your brain and allowing that which is elemental to take charge and to take control.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:49.280]   But you see, notice it's implicit in this statement here, the way in which this abuses
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.960]   man's body.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:58.640]   Not only his mind and his spirit, he even abuses his body and the powers of his body.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.200]   And as they do it, they're abusing their very bodies and the powers of the body.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.000]   They put their energy, their strength into it all.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.560]   You see, there's an element of sarcasm in this world.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.480]   They're no longer mighty for their country.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:35.040]   They're no longer men of strength for some great and some noble cause.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:42.160]   So, it all goes into this kind of thing, into pleasure, into living on drugs and standing
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   up to it.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.440]   And the strength of the body is given to this.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.200]   No longer a service and so on, admired and revered by men.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.480]   No body, mind, everything and the whole of men's strength is being given to debauchery
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.640]   in various ways, and it's a terrible abuse of the body.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:12.000]   There have been some notable examples of this very thing in this present century.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.600]   One of the most brilliant brains in the political world of this present century died at the
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:24.240]   age of 58 of cirrhosis of the liver, entirely due to excessive drinking.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.320]   And he is not the only one.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:35.640]   It's an insult to men, it's an insult to his mind, his brain, his understanding, his
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   body.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.720]   It hits, it attacks the body, it violates the body.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.120]   And you see, the tragedy is this, that the whole time when men are giving their strength
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:52.840]   to drink and to mixing wine and to pleasure and things of this kind, they have no idea
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:35:01.480]   of men truly functioning as men, men as made by God, mind or spirit and soul and body,
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.200]   a wonderful triunity, a perfect balance, and man was meant to live in all these realms
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   at the same time.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.360]   They have no idea of that at all.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.560]   And man's strength should be in what?
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.600]   Well, I'll tell you, our Lord summed up the law one day by putting it like this.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:31.320]   and with all thy strength, and thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.880]   But you see, while man is the victim of sin and under the power of sin, he has no conception
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.440]   of this at all.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.120]   And he insults his mind, he insults his soul, he insults his very body.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:49.040]   He's abusing it, he's overstimulating it, and he dies at an early age or he has frayed
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.680]   nerves and he becomes the victim of perhaps various branches of medicine to which he should
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:03.040]   never have to go at all, simply because he doesn't know how to live.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.880]   I could illustrate this, my dear friends, at very great length if I was disposed to
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.320]   do so.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.480]   I once had the privilege of looking through the card index of the patients of a very great
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:20.560]   physician, and I found that this was his diagnosis very frequently.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.320]   Now, this was a great expert in medicine, but this was the diagnosis.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:35.400]   Eats too much, drinks too much, dances too much, doesn't sleep enough.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.680]   In his business at day, rioting at night, as it were, living for pleasure, and insulting
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.800]   his body, getting himself down, his strength being wasted.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:53.520]   Not realizing how to live and to use the gifts that God has given him, not using his mind,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:00.000]   not using his soul, not using his strength, even his physical strength, but all the time
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.680]   attacking it with overstimulation, and the result is a premature exhaustion.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.400]   But let me come to the third and the last principle which is taught us in these two
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.040]   verses and which is, of course, the most serious of all.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.480]   Sin affects all types.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.860]   No man is immune to it.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.920]   It causes a man to insult his own nature, and thirdly, it degrades men and destroys
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.200]   the best and the highest in him.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.920]   The two things go together.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:36.520]   Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.080]   which justifies the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.160]   from him.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.280]   And they do the second because of the first.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.040]   Though they're men of ability, the men of understanding, though they've got to the
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:54.480]   high positions, because of the degrading effect of sin in their own personal lives, their
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.160]   very judgment goes, everything goes.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.680]   Sin always leads to degradation in every form.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.600]   I've shown you how it does it to the body.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.520]   It does it still more in the highest respects of all.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.360]   Now the Apostle Paul has summed all this up by putting it like this.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.320]   He says evil communications corrupt good manners.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.800]   And they do.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.840]   Wrong ideas will always lead to wrong practice.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.320]   It may take a long time to do it, but it always does so.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:34.120]   I suppose that the greatest fallacy of all of this twentieth century has been just this,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:41.400]   that you can have righteousness without godliness.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.640]   That I think has been the greatest single fallacy.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:52.920]   That though you give up God and give up a belief in him and in the gospel, you can still
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.200]   maintain the righteousness of the gospel.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.640]   That you can hold on to the ethics after you've abandoned the doctrine.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.440]   That's been the greatest fallacy.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.720]   That's exactly what they began to do about the middle of the Victorian era, and it's
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.240]   been accelerated greatly, of course, in this present century, and we are now witnessing
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.320]   the full effect and result of that very teaching.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   But it's impossible.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.840]   You cannot have righteousness without godliness.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   That's the great message of the Bible.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.200]   The apostle Paul puts it again in Romans 1 18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:39.400]   him against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.760]   And here the prophet Isaiah puts it in this pictorial manner before us.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.600]   You see, these very men to whom they should have looked for justice and for leadership
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.800]   themselves were beginning to tamper with justice.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   Why?
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:59.240]   Well, because of their own personal sin and because of their own personal failure.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.600]   Sin always blunts the moral sense.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.200]   Sin always blunts the sense of right and wrong.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.960]   Sin always blunts the sense of justice.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.920]   You cannot go on sinning without your conscience being affected.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.680]   For the difference there is between committing an act of sin the first time and the hundredth
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   time.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.400]   Oh, the hesitation the first time.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   Why?
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.720]   Well, conscience was speaking powerfully and restraining you and warning you and telling
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   you, "Don't!
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   Look at what happens.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.720]   Look at the conscience."
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.000]   But then you do it, and then, "Ease your necks, time.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Ease your necks."
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.240]   And on and on you go until at the end your conscience doesn't speak at all.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.360]   You very early haven't got a conscience at all.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.200]   Or as the apostle puts it again, "It has become seared with a hot iron."
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.800]   And you are, as it were, a conscienceless person because sin always corrodes the conscience.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.960]   It always dulls it.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   It blunts it.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:59.680]   A man cannot go on thinking wrongly and sinning in any respect without blunting all his moral
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   values and his sense of right and wrong and his sense of justice.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   The conscience is always involved.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.640]   And of course, this is the very thing that we are seeing before our eyes at the present
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.400]   time.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.920]   I prophesy to you that the day is not far distant when they'll probably have to do
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.480]   away with the jury system of trying cases in this country altogether.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   Why?
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.520]   Well, because you can't rely upon jurymen bringing in verdicts of justice.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   Why not?
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.800]   Well, because they don't look at it in terms of right and wrong.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.720]   They look at it in terms of themselves.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:41.200]   Now, a friend of mine was serving on a certain jury, grand jury, some three or four years
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.800]   ago, and he told me exactly what happened.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   There were a whole series of motoring offences.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.360]   This was a number of cases being tried at certain famous court of sessions.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.400]   And my friend told me that this is what had happened.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   They had heard the facts.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.800]   Then the jury retired.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.720]   And the foreman of the jury said, "Well, now then, what about it?"
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.160]   And to this friend of mine, the case was as plain as daylight.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.480]   The man on trial was obviously guilty.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.720]   It wasn't a difficult case.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   There was no hesitation.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.240]   There was no question.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.200]   So when the foreman of the jury put the question, my friend replied and said, "Well, surely
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.520]   it's a perfectly clear case.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.080]   The man is obviously guilty."
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.440]   And he thought they'd all agree and they'd soon be able to go home.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.120]   Not a bit of it.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.480]   The attitude of his fellow juryman was this.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.840]   It might be you next time.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.600]   This might happen to you.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.700]   Would you like a verdict of guilty if you were the man on trial?
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.280]   In other words, you see, you're no longer thinking in terms of right and wrong.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   It's no longer justice.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.680]   What if it happens to me?
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   How can I protect myself?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   Yes.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.880]   Justify the wicked for reward.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.560]   And the reward is that I get off when my case comes up.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.360]   You're no longer looking at it dispassionately, objectively, and honestly.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.720]   You're an interested party.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.320]   You've got an ulterior motive.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.160]   Your whole notion of justice has become vitiated.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   Because?
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   Why?
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.240]   Well, because you're a sinner.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.360]   Because you know that you tend to do the same thing as this man on trial did.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.600]   He tried to pass when he shouldn't have done.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   He was caught.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   He went.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   Ah!
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.280]   What if it's you next time?
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   What if it happened to you?
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   Well, there it is.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   There's a simple illustration.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:34.440]   But you see, this is not something that is confined to the ordinary men, the businessmen,
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   and others.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.240]   I suggest to you that this is the thing we are witnessing on a much higher level at the
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.640]   present time.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:49.120]   Almost every day we are reading some statement or other by some don in Oxford or in Cambridge
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.840]   on this moral question.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.800]   And this is the modern attitude.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.920]   Not is this right or is this wrong?
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.600]   I don't go looking into cupboards.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:04.360]   And what I don't see, I don't speak about.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.520]   You see the attitude.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.160]   Not only that, it's even worse than that.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.640]   Sin is being excused.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.480]   Sin is being explained away.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.880]   Sin, the notion of sin is being ridiculed.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:23.280]   We've got a new morality, which is indicative of the changed times, we are told.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.440]   You don't go on with old ideas as many evolves and changes.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.880]   Your ideas must change.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.360]   What may have appeared wrong is no longer wrong.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.520]   You've no longer got objective standards.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.080]   Everything is in a state of flux, no eternal truth.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.880]   Isn't this the position at the present time?
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.160]   Where are the guardians of morality?
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.080]   Where are the men who should be speaking?
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.880]   What are the statesmen?
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.960]   What are leaders in church?
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   What are the leaders in every department of life?
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.880]   Listen to them on your wreath lectures and other places.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.160]   Read their lectures and you'll find their advocate experimental marriage.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.720]   And they say that these things are not always wrong.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.280]   There are times when they may be right, that love is before chastity.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.640]   Indeed, they put love and chastity as opposites.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   The new morality.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   Here's the very thing of which the prophet Isaiah was writing and on which he was pronouncing
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   his will.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.960]   And it all, you see, leads to this.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:27.120]   That a sense of duty and of responsibility is rapidly disappearing out of the land.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.600]   Ideas of service have gone.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.720]   What can I get out of it?
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.160]   The easiest and the maximum reward.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   Nothing voluntary.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   Service is going.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.400]   All these glorious things are rapidly disappearing out of the land.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.240]   And everything's being excused.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   Everything's all right.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.760]   We're in a state of change and we're advancing.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.640]   Goodness is despised.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.160]   Integrity is laughed at.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:03.400]   And chastity and purity are regarded as outmurdered and old-fashioned and out of date.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.800]   And if you happen to be trying to live a godly and a righteous life, you'll be persecuted.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   You'll be laughed at.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.680]   You'll be treated with scorn and with derision.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.600]   Defy the wicked for reward.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:23.200]   Take away the righteousness of the righteous from him.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:32.240]   And all that, I say, is due to the fact that men are living lives of sin themselves.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.960]   Why are they attacking the teaching of the Bible about sin?
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:41.640]   Well, because, you see, this is one of the general effects of sin upon a man.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.180]   It poisons him.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.180]   It makes him cynical.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.180]   What's it matter?
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.080]   He says, "Give me peace, anything for a life of peace."
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:53.280]   Not only that, he's covering himself.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.640]   He's trying to quieten his own conscience.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.440]   And if your conscience is attacking you on the grounds of morality, the best way of treating
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.160]   it is to produce a new morality and prove with your intellect that what's hurting you
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.720]   is simply some hangover from some ill-developed condition of the human race.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.880]   So you invent a new morality in order to try to quieten your own conscience.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.760]   And then you take your drugs and on it goes, and you plunge more and more into pleasure.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.140]   And you excuse it in others in order that you may be excused yourself.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:33.000]   And as you go on, your highest centers have been knocked out of action.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.040]   And you are returning to the life of an animal.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:44.200]   And sometimes it's even worse, it's the life of a beast.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.800]   And it's even worse than death.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.600]   For the beast doesn't deliberately drug himself.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:57.240]   The beast doesn't deliberately knock out his highest centers of understanding and of control
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.480]   in order to have a riot of the lower nature.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:08.000]   He may eat poison berries by accident, he doesn't know it, but man does it deliberately.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:18.880]   And thus man stands out in the whole of the universe of God as the greatest fool, insulting
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:28.120]   himself, insulting the nature that has been made after the image of God, and boasting
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:36.680]   and glorying in his shame, whose God is their belly and they glory in their shame.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:49.640]   Not only do evil, but rejoice in them that do it, and encourage one another in the performance.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.040]   And the Bible has got nothing to say to such people except that the wrath of God is upon
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.040]   them.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:03.360]   Woe unto them that think like that and that live like that.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:11.600]   You can't insult yourself and you can't insult God and get away with it.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.320]   If you could, God wouldn't be God.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:19.320]   God must deal with this, he must punish it, and he has told us that he's going to do so.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:25.480]   He has warned us, he's pronounced his woes, he's exposed it to us, he's asked us to think
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.960]   and to realize it.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:36.920]   Why, in order, I say again that we may see it and repent of it.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:42.640]   And I'm in this pulpit in order to voice out this word of invitation from God.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.720]   I've told you his hatred of sin and evil, I've reminded you of his woes upon it, but
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   my dear friend, I'm here to tell you that that isn't God's last word.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.480]   "Realize it," he says, "and stop.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:06.000]   Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light."
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.880]   It's life you want, isn't it?
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.640]   It's happiness you want, it's joy you want, that's what you want.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.520]   Of course it is, it's all right, that we should desire that, but my dear friend, there's only
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.440]   one way to get it.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.280]   You don't get it this other way.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:28.480]   It mocks you, it deludes you, it leads you on and leaves you in misery and in despair
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:36.000]   and in unhappiness and final utter hopelessness.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.840]   And there's only one way out of all this.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:49.160]   It isn't more education, it isn't further royal commissions, it isn't a new department
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:56.680]   of state, it isn't a new cabinet minister with special charge for the problem of immorality.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.360]   We'll probably come to that.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:05.200]   But it'll avail us nothing, nothing at all.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.720]   Sin is so powerful.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:12.640]   It can affect the greatest brain, the greatest understanding, the most stalwart person, and
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.280]   it brings them down.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.960]   It can break a man physically, it can break him mentally, it can break him morally, it's
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:27.600]   been doing so throughout the running centuries, it's still doing so.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.720]   And there is only one power that can deal with it.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:38.600]   Listen, he breaks the power of cancelled sin.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:44.280]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.840]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:56.440]   His blood availed for me.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.960]   This is the only power that can break the power of sin, the power of Christ, the Son
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:09.360]   of God, the power of his holy life which never sinned, the power of his resurrection, the
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   power of his blood to cancel all your sin and iniquity, the power of Christ through
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   the Holy Spirit to give you a new birth and a new nature and a new outlook and a new understanding
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:30.760]   and a new everything.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:37.600]   He will give you a nature that will make you love the light and hate the darkness instead
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.720]   of hating the light and loving the darkness.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:51.760]   Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.200]   God who commended the light to shine out of darkness has shined into our hearts to give
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:03.400]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.320]   And when you've seen it, you'll have peace, you'll have joy, you'll have happiness, you
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   won't need drugs.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   Christ is everything, all in all.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:20.320]   The lily of the valley, the bright and morning star, is the fairest of ten thousand to my
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   soul.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:28.240]   He said to the woman of Samaria, poor woman, who'd had five husbands and then was living
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:35.800]   with a man who wasn't a husband, trying to find happiness, trying to find joy, but not
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   succeeding.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   He says, woman, the water that I give thee shall be in thee a well of water springing
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.480]   up into everlasting life.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.200]   He that drinketh of this water shall thirst again, but he that drinketh of the water that
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:54:00.760]   I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I will give him will be in him
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.160]   a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.840]   You needn't take purple hearts if you're a Christian.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.740]   You needn't mix your cocktails.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.720]   You needn't get a kick out of artificial stimulants.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.420]   You'll get it all in Christ, and infinitely more.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:22.200]   And it's clean, it's pure, it'll even revivify your very body.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:28.240]   It'll make a man of you a total personality.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.120]   And it'll do that for you immediately.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.320]   And it'll enable you to live while you're left in this world.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.880]   And it'll enable you to die triumphantly and victoriously.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:50.280]   And it'll usher you into heaven and the glory of God, and the joys that have no ending,
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.120]   and the love which cannot cease.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:55:01.640]   Oh, my dear friend, recognize that you are as you are by nature, are a victim, a slave
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:10.160]   of sin and Satan and evil, and that nothing and no one but the Son of God can set you
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.760]   free, but he can.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:23.080]   If the Son shall set you free, ye shall be free indeed.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:35.680]   Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.160]   Amen.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.080]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
