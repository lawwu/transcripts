[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.040]   As I mentioned last time, Pastor John is in the middle
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.440]   of a very busy ministry month of January,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I would ask for your prayers on his behalf.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.880]   He began the year preaching at the Cross Conference
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.480]   in Louisville, a little later at the G3 Conference
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.240]   in Atlanta he spoke, and now he prepares
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.160]   for the 2019 Bethlehem College and Seminary Pastors
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.080]   Conference on the theme of Christian joy.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.020]   Looking forward to that.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.120]   That conference is here in Minneapolis.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.860]   It begins on Monday and it ends on Wednesday.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.940]   Again, your prayers would be appreciated.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.040]   And one more time, with Pastor John out of the pocket,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.320]   we are joined by Tim Keller over the phone
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800]   from New York City to talk about vocation and work
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.280]   in his really helpful book, "Every Good Endeavor,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.380]   "Connecting Your Work to God's Work."
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.400]   Tim, yesterday we talked about vocational misuse
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.520]   when we think of work only in terms of self-fulfillment,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.280]   self-realization, and how it slowly crushes a person
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.540]   when they approach their vocation that way.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.320]   This is a huge topic for parents who are desiring
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.520]   to train their kids for this diligent labor in the future.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.300]   In your book you write this, quote,
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.140]   "Work did not come into creation
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.840]   "after a golden age of leisure," end quote.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.040]   That's a great point.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.560]   Work did not come into creation
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.020]   after a golden age of leisure.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.420]   Human labor is deliberately embedded into creation
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.320]   from the start, as you know.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.200]   I love this line.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.360]   Speak to parents, though, building off of this.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360]   Tim, how do I as a dad teach and train my kids
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   about the divine value of work?
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.860]   - Well, you have to get the basic doctrines
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.360]   of creation and fall and redemption,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.640]   and you have to give it to children at every age,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.360]   but you have to give it in a form
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.480]   that they can handle at that age.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.120]   But I think you have to say that work was put
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.640]   into the Garden of Eden.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   When God had everything absolutely perfect, there was work.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   And that must mean that even though in this life,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.920]   work is often difficult.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   Our bodies break down, so work can actually wear us down.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.900]   Our minds and our hearts aren't what they should be
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.240]   because of sin, and very often we have trouble
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.060]   paying attention to things.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.640]   But basically, in the end, we were made to work,
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.240]   and we're only happy if we do work.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.480]   And you can even say people that don't have work
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.200]   or don't do work in the long run get depressed.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.680]   And the reason why they do that
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.580]   is because we were made for it.
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.160]   We were made to find fulfillment in working
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.920]   and being useful to others in that work.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   And I think there's a way of getting that across
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.840]   to 11-year-olds and seven-year-olds.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.460]   The way I raise children, too.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.080]   You say things, you're not sure they get it.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.640]   You find out in question and answer
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.840]   to what degree they understood it
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.680]   and what degree they don't,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.760]   and then you try to make it simpler
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.560]   until you feel like you've hit home.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.000]   - Yeah, absolutely, very true, good word.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.560]   Okay, so the kid grows up.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.520]   Fast forward to a young man or a woman
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.840]   now seriously contemplating a career path.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.960]   One of the things you say in your book
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.320]   is that you find in New York City
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.440]   that a number of young college graduates
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.000]   select careers as a form of personal identity.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.840]   A career becomes something like a car,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.520]   is a status marker.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.680]   Explain that phenomenon, what do you see?
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.200]   - Well, there's been a lot of great books
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.800]   written recently on this idea
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840]   that we live in a consumeristic age
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.600]   in which your identity is seen in the products you consume.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560]   I'm the kind of person that wears this kind of clothing,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.420]   owns this kind of, these electronics,
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.960]   these are the accessories I use.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.220]   So you actually get your identity
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.760]   from the brands that you use.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.680]   And I'm afraid that what's happened here
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.720]   is that jobs are like that too.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.600]   And there's just no doubt,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   I see plenty of people taking jobs that really don't fit.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.680]   A, it doesn't fit their talents very well.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.360]   And B, very often the jobs don't necessarily fulfill them
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.480]   because the jobs aren't really maybe helping people
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   very much, but the jobs are high status.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.840]   And because they're high status,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.160]   people feel like I need to be in that job
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.360]   so I can feel good about myself.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   So it's an identity marker.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.640]   So people are very often not choosing jobs
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.800]   on the basis of vocation,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.000]   not saying what gifts do I have
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.280]   and how can I be useful to other people through my work?
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600]   But how do I take a job that gives me
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.900]   the same kind of sense of self-worth I get
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.080]   when I'm driving a particular kind of car?
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.240]   - Yeah, that's an important word.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   Okay, so let me press into vocation
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.000]   from the consumer's perspective
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.880]   and post you a little hypothetical scenario, if you will.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.720]   Let's say in ancient Babylon,
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.840]   there's a man who grows straw.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.880]   He's good at it.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.880]   He works hard.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.520]   He serves his buyer well.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.920]   He always delivers the product on time.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.320]   He never overcharges.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.440]   His straw then is purchased
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.200]   and is immediately used to create reinforced baked bricks
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.480]   that are stacked by other laborers into the Tower of Babel.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.520]   All of that to ask,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.800]   at what point is the straw grower's vocation
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.720]   made virtuous or corrupt by the end product down the chain?
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.000]   How do you think through that?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.240]   - Well, I mean, I think you have to be
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.000]   very directly collaborating with the evil
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.560]   before you start to try to get that.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.320]   See, the trouble with the purest impulse is this.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.920]   If I make bread and I know that there are criminals in town
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.520]   eating that bread and staying alive
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.320]   because of my bread making,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.680]   should I really get out of that?
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.640]   Should I say, okay, well, only a certain percent,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.560]   well, only a certain percent.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.400]   I'm helping them live.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.080]   I mean, if you actually,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.560]   Luther would laugh at the idea
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.360]   that you in some pure way have to make sure
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.000]   that your work only furthers godly ends.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.120]   He says, your job is there to,
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.760]   God feeds everything that has breath.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.640]   Luther expounds the Psalms,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.720]   especially Psalms 145 and 146, 147,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.800]   where it talks about God feeds everything that has breath.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.760]   He loves everything that he's made.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.720]   And Luther then says, okay,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.200]   well, how does God feed everybody?
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.440]   Well, he feeds them through the farmer.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.000]   He feeds them through the milkmaid,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   who's milking the cow.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.080]   He feeds it through the truck driver
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.960]   who's bringing the things to market.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.560]   That's really God's work then.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.640]   If you're just farming, you're doing God's work.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.720]   It doesn't have to be a Christian farmer.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.740]   You just do it and it's God's work.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.520]   But then at a certain point,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   I do believe 'cause I'm Reformed
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.020]   and I believe in world view, importance of world view,
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.760]   that work also does need to have,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.580]   it has to be done from a Christian perspective.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.280]   But I also think that Luther's got something to say,
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.620]   that all work is good work if it's done well.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.480]   And that if you actually try to say,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.740]   well, this work is actually helping someone
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.980]   who's furthering evil ends,
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.040]   at a certain point you'd be completely paralyzed.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.120]   You couldn't do anything.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.960]   - Right, yeah.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.160]   So apply Luther's logic a step further
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.280]   and apply it to that Christian brother or sister
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.040]   we talked about last time on Wednesday
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.120]   who feels trapped in a vocation that they don't like.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.160]   - Luther's understanding of calling
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.440]   is that the farm girl who's milking the cows
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.880]   needs to, even if it's the only job available to her
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.920]   and she'd like to go somewhere else,
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.660]   she needs to see what she's doing is God's calling.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.840]   She needs to see that this isn't just milking cows,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.000]   this is my way of participating
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.160]   in God's care for his creation.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.600]   Because he has decided this is how I'm going to do it.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.120]   - There's a place where Luther takes,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.960]   I forget what Psalm, where he says,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.440]   God strengthens the bars of the city gates.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.800]   In other words, he gives you security.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.640]   And then Luther says,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.400]   but how does God strengthen the bar of your city gates?
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.320]   He does it with good governors
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.200]   and good policemen and good soldiers.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.880]   And what he's trying to get across
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   is that all good work done well is God's calling.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.640]   And that aspect, see,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.760]   I actually do think that the Calvinist understanding
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   of calling, which is doing God's work
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.400]   from a Christian worldview
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.660]   and the Lutheran understanding of calling,
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.320]   which is simply caring for creation,
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.220]   being useful to other people through the work you do.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.680]   I do think they're complimentary.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.360]   I really do.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   And I think it's a very big part of the book
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.680]   is to bring out the fact that I think they're complimentary.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.440]   You've got to use them both.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.680]   So seeing your work as a calling is not a problem
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.600]   if you're stuck in a job you don't like.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.840]   You need to say that right now, it's still God's calling.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.960]   And that gives me a set,
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.000]   I think that gives you a lot of peace to say,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   hey, I can still answer God's calling in this job,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.280]   even when I am looking for a job
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.960]   that I think fits my gifts better.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.800]   - Really good.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.080]   Thank you for your time, Dr. Keller.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.560]   I wish we had more time together
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.080]   and thank you for writing this really excellent,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.720]   thoughtful, substantial, and approachable book
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.200]   on vocation, "We Needed It."
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.320]   - Thank you, Tony.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.160]   I appreciate that.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.680]   You are most welcome.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.720]   That was Tim Keller from his office in New York City
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.040]   talking with us about his book,
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.880]   "Every Good Endeavor, Connecting Your Work to God's Work."
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.640]   And this was actually a phone interview
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.320]   I recorded with him a few years back,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.200]   but never released in the APJ series.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.040]   So there you are.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.840]   And speaking of years, in six years,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.960]   we have generated over 1,300 episodes in this podcast.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.440]   And all of them can be found at our online home
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.520]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.320]   Again, please be praying for Pastor John
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.560]   and for the Bethlehem College
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.000]   and Seminary Pastors Conference, which begins on Monday.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.400]   It could be live-streamed, maybe, maybe not.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.200]   Honestly, I don't know if it is or not.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.440]   Usually it is.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.320]   In any case, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.520]   We'll see you next time.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
