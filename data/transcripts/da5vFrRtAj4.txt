[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   We are still considering, as most of you will remember, the words which are to be found
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.760]   in Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 8 and verse 16.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:22.080]   The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240]   Now we've been looking at this great and most important subject.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.400]   We've been defining what it means, the nature of the experience that one has when this takes
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.880]   place, when the Spirit does bear witness with our spirits.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.360]   In other words, we've been considering how the Spirit bears this witness, and we've seen
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.960]   that it's something very direct.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.280]   It is the Spirit really bearing His witness with our spirit that we are the children of
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.360]   God.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.520]   And then we went on last week to consider how this could be differentiated from a spurious
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.520]   or a false kind of experience which the devil, the adversary of our souls, is always ready
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.360]   to supply as a kind of counterfeit.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.040]   The history of the Church, as I indicated, as well as the teaching of the New Testament,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.040]   compelled us to do that.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.080]   We are to try the Spirit.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.360]   We are not to believe every spirit.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.400]   That's New Testament warning.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   And therefore we had to spend some time in considering the ways by which this true experience
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.600]   can be differentiated from the false experience.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400]   Now that leads us on to another matter.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.620]   It's not at all difficult to understand how it comes to pass that the devil should be
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:04.280]   particularly anxious to cause confusion over this which I have described as the highest
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.040]   and perhaps the greatest experience that is possible to a Christian in this world.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   Obviously, the higher you go in spiritual experience or in the spiritual realm, the
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.200]   more you are likely to be attacked by the devil.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.480]   No one has ever been tempted in this world in the way in which our blessed Lord and Saviour
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.840]   was tempted.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.640]   And it has been the universal testimony of the saints throughout the centuries that the
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.560]   closer they walked with God, the more furious was the attack of the adversary upon them.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.520]   And furthermore, the history of the Church demonstrates so clearly that any very central
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   and glorious doctrine has been a special object of attack.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.900]   Take for instance the confusion which has reigned for so long over the whole question
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.480]   of the Lord's Supper.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.820]   There you see again is something very special.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.680]   So the devil has come in and he has invented theories and brought to pass the most extraordinary
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.880]   and fantastic views.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.280]   In other words, whenever there is any aspect of the Christian life, I say, which is unusually
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.400]   precious, you can be certain that the attack of the enemy at that point will be particularly
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   strong.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.360]   Well, now it is exactly the same with this particular matter of the testimony of the
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.480]   Spirit with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.040]   Now we have seen that partly already, but I come tonight to look at another aspect of
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.280]   it, and that is the relationship between this experience and sanctification.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.920]   Now it is most unfortunate, it seems to me, that this confusion has ever arisen.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.120]   Unfortunately it has arisen many times.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:13.400]   Throughout the centuries there have been various groups and collections of people who have
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   dropped into this confusion.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   There have always been groups that have taught a kind of perfectionism, and the perfectionism
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.720]   has generally been taught some way or another in terms of this particular experience of
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.880]   the sealing of the Spirit, the baptism of the Spirit, whichever term you may happen
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.440]   to imply.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.840]   And unfortunately that is still the case.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:47.600]   The modern confusion as between this experience and sanctification was started by no lesser
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.880]   person than John Wesley.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.760]   He began to teach that in the early 1740s, and it has persisted in various forms ever
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   since.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.440]   And you are able to trace most of the modern perfectionist groups in the Christian Church
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.320]   right back to the teaching of John Wesley.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   Some of them you can trace much more directly than others.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.520]   However, he is the father of all this tendency to identify these two things.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.280]   Now the teaching more or less is this, that it is possible for the Christian to have this
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   baptism of the Spirit, and in having it he is entirely cleansed from sin.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.160]   He is given a new or a clean heart.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.720]   He is given perfect love, and there is perfect love towards God.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.160]   The teaching is that sin is entirely eradicated out of him, taken right out of the entire
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.960]   system, out of the whole personality, so that as a result of this baptism of the Spirit,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:05.240]   this experience of the Spirit, the believer is entirely cleansed from sin and becomes
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.600]   completely or entirely sanctified.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.000]   Well now you may well ask, on what ground do they put their teaching forward?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.160]   What scriptural evidence do they claim they can adduce to support and to substantiate
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   this teaching?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.920]   Well now, the two main passages are the ones I have already read to you this evening, but
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.480]   let me remind you of them.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:42.600]   The first is in Acts 15, 9, where you remember the apostle Peter is explaining to the council
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.640]   at Jerusalem what he did in the case of Cornelius and his household.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.040]   "God," says Peter, "which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.960]   Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.640]   And he put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.680]   Now there it is, they say.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.400]   You have already quoted that verse in establishing that this experience of the Spirit is something
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:23.880]   separate from, and subsequent to, and additional to, the original belief and regeneration.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.480]   But they say, "Why didn't you go on and complete the statement?
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.840]   Why didn't you go on and quote the whole of the Scripture?"
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.480]   There is the final statement, "put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480]   by faith."
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   They say the thing is quite clear.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.400]   Purifying means purifying.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.440]   And we are told that their hearts were purified by faith.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.720]   That is the argument.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.600]   And then you have got the second one in the 26th chapter of the book of Acts of the Apostles,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   in verse 18, where our Lord is giving the apostle Paul his commission.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.360]   And he is telling him that he is going to deliver him from the people, which means the
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   Jews, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:24.840]   them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:33.680]   forgiveness of sins, and the inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith, that is,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   in me.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   There you are.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.400]   They say you have got the same thing again.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.600]   It is said that they are sanctified by faith.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.880]   And therefore, they do not hesitate to teach that it is possible thus for a Christian believer
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.040]   to be entirely sanctified or purified by faith.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.480]   And their argument is that you have got their two explicit statements in the Scripture.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.360]   Well now then, what do we say about this?
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.760]   It obviously is a very important matter.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.840]   There are people who claim that they have been entirely sanctified, that they have been
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:16.200]   entirely purified, that there is no longer any sin in them at all, but that they are
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.160]   in the condition which they would claim is described in these two verses.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.600]   Well now, let us have a look at these two statements and see what we can discover.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   The first thing always when you have a verse or a statement of Scripture which is perplexing,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.120]   the first thing you must do always is to look at your statement in its context and in its
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   setting.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:46.560]   And never was that principle, that canon of interpretation, more important than it is
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.800]   at this particular point.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:58.240]   Now look at the context in both cases, and I think you will see the moment you do so,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:07.920]   that the question of sanctification does not arise in either of the instances.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:16.000]   Both statements are not concerned at all with the biblical doctrine of sanctification.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.440]   That means, as you know, that one is progressively cleansed and purified from sin.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.320]   One becomes more and more holy.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.640]   Now then, I am saying that in both the settings there is no reference whatsoever to that.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.120]   Take the case of Acts 15.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.600]   Peter was not at all concerned there to deal with the question of sanctification as distinct
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.480]   from justification.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.600]   Neither was our Lord in giving the commission at that point to Paul, telling him that he
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.120]   would have to teach justification and then sanctification.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.840]   It does not arise in either case.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   Well what is it?
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.000]   Well clearly, what is happening in both cases is this.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.080]   The pointed issue in the council at Jerusalem in Acts 15 was the position and the condition
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.000]   of the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.040]   Peter had admitted Cornelius and his household into the church.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.840]   There were Jewish Christians who were querying that and questioning them.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.880]   Their argument was that nobody should become a Christian unless he became a Jew, unless
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.780]   he become circumcised.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.240]   That circumcision was essential to salvation.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.320]   That was the argument, and that therefore Peter was very wrong in baptizing these people
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.460]   because they were Gentiles and because they had never been circumcised.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:48.480]   And all that Peter is concerned to do is this, is to justify himself in baptizing and admitting
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.520]   into the Christian church these Gentile believers.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.920]   That is all he is concerned to do, nothing further.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.560]   He is not concerned at all to deal with their state of sanctification or of anything else,
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.240]   but simply to justify the fact that they are in the Christian church.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.000]   That is his sole motive at that point.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.280]   And what he says is this, that with the coming of the gospel, the way to become God's people
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.800]   is no longer that of circumcision.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.600]   It is that of faith and of belief.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.400]   That is the only thing he wants to say, it is the only thing he needs to say, it is the
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.120]   only thing that he says.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.720]   All he says is this, he says you must no longer think in terms of Jews and Gentiles, the Jews
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.760]   being God's people and clean, the Gentiles being dogs and unclean.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.360]   No, says Peter, that is gone.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.480]   Jews and Gentiles are now both made clean and God's people in the same way, and the
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.080]   way is by faith, purifying their hearts by faith.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.680]   And of course in the commission given to Paul by the Lord on the road to Damascus, it is
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.160]   exactly the same thing.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:09.200]   He says I am going to deliver you, I am going to protect you and keep you safe from the
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.440]   attacks and the onslaughts of the people, that is to say the Jews, but not only the
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.360]   Jews but also from the Gentiles unto whom I now send thee.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.520]   Now then what is he going to tell the Gentiles?
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.880]   Well he is to open their eyes, he is to turn them from darkness to light and from the power
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.480]   of Satan unto God.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   What for?
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:39.920]   Well that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance, a share, a position.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:48.240]   Well, among those, them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   In other words, it is the same point once more.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.160]   The Jewish believers in Christ are set in this new position, but so are the Gentiles
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   who will believe in Christ by faith that is in me.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.080]   They are put into this same position as the Jews, and there is no difference at all.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.520]   It is possible, in other words, says the Lord to Paul, for you now to tell Gentiles that
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.760]   if they but exercise faith in me, they shall not only have their sins forgiven, but they
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:23.880]   will be put into the same position as the Jews like yourself who have already believed
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880]   in me.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:32.200]   Now then, that I am suggesting to you is the sole purpose of both statements.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.680]   Sanctification does not arise at all.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.720]   The biblical notion of sanctification as something distinct from justification is not considered
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.400]   even in either of the two illustrations.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.680]   Let me tell you what it does mean.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:54.840]   This I say is just a statement in both instances to point out what God had said long ago to
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.000]   the children of Israel just before he gave them the Ten Commandments.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.280]   You will find it in Exodus 19, and you will find that the Apostle Peter quotes it in the
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.200]   first epistle in the second chapter and in verses 9 and 10.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   Now what was the statement?
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.600]   Well, God looked at the children of Israel and he said, "Ye are a chosen generation,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people."
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   You remember it?
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:32.440]   And then the Apostle Peter writing to Gentiles, who now had become Christians, applies that
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   to them.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.520]   He says, "Don't you realize this?
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:44.800]   You," he says to these Gentile believers, "are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.200]   an holy nation."
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:54.660]   True of the Gentiles now as well as it is of the Jews of old.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:02.120]   In other words, the meaning of the terms "purified" or "sanctified" by faith in both cases is
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.200]   "setting apart as God's people."
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.620]   It doesn't mean any more than that.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.840]   It didn't mean any more than that in the case of the Israelites.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.720]   You only have to read their story to know that it cannot mean sanctification.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.640]   All it means is this, that while the other nations of the world were not God's people,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.800]   God had put these people on one side as his own people.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.520]   He'd made them for himself.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.640]   They were to be to him a peculiar possession, so they are a holy people.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.760]   The others are profane.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.680]   And in exactly the same way as you know, you get the mount on which the law was given to
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.120]   Moses referred to as a holy mount.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.560]   It's a sanctified mount.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.080]   It's a mount that's set apart.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.360]   You talk about purifying of the instruments and the vessels of the sanctuary and of the
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.840]   temple and so on.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.200]   Now that is the meaning of the terms in both instances.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.480]   Sanctification is not even remotely introduced at all.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.640]   But wait a minute, that's only the beginning of the evidence.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.860]   I'm asserting that the context establishes all that.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:12.320]   That it was only concern to say that the Gentiles become the people of God, a part of the holy
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.580]   nation, a part of this peculiar possession of God by faith.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.840]   That they've been cleansed from that which kept them out before.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   What is that?
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.640]   Well, further, here we have a statement in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 3 and
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.440]   verse 12, which is very important in this whole argument.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:42.840]   "Take heed, brethren," says the author, "to these believers, lest there be in any of you
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God."
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.160]   Now that's a very important statement.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:05.920]   Unbelief comes from an evil heart, which means a polluted heart, an unclean heart, an evil
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.800]   heart of unbelief.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.120]   What's the opposite of that?
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.720]   Well, the opposite of that is belief.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.280]   Where does belief come from?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:21.000]   Well, belief comes from a heart that is no longer evil, it's no longer unclean, it is
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.360]   no longer polluted.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.320]   Which is precisely the thing that Peter argues in the council at Jerusalem as having taken
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:35.280]   place, put no difference between them and us, purifying their hearts by faith.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.160]   Their hearts were evil, their hearts were unclean.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.120]   But says Peter, as I was preaching, they believed the gospel.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.320]   It's obvious, therefore, that their hearts have been cleansed from that evil unbelief
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   that was in them.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.600]   They've no longer got evil hearts of unbelief.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.520]   Their hearts have been purified by faith.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.040]   And so, says Peter, I baptize them.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.240]   Peter's not saying for a moment that these people have been suddenly completely sanctified.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.560]   That's what it means.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.280]   The other argument means that Peter is saying that Cornelius and his household, hearing
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.840]   the gospel for the first time, were not only made believers, but were entirely sanctified
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.040]   at that one moment, and never had any need to grow afterwards.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.400]   The thing, of course, is quite ridiculous.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   All we are told is that their hearts were delivered from that evil unbelief that was
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.200]   in them formerly.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.400]   Their heart is purified from unbelief by faith.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.480]   In other words, the way they come in is not that they go through some ceremonial ablutions
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   and so on.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.440]   It's simply by faith, by believing.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   Very well.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   But wait a minute, we've got still further evidence.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.200]   Take, for instance, what the Apostle Paul says in the first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.240]   chapter 6, beginning at verse 9.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.520]   "Be not deceived," he says, "God is not mocked."
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:06.640]   Most important statement is, "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.240]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.840]   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:28.120]   And such were some of you, but ye are washed, ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.800]   the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.680]   Now, what's important there, of course, is to notice the order.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.320]   You notice that "sanctified" is put before "justified."
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:47.200]   He says, "You're washed, you're sanctified, you're justified."
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.160]   Has the Apostle suddenly gone to sleep?
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.640]   Has he forgotten that justification must come before sanctification?
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.720]   Well, obviously he hasn't.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.200]   He's a man divinely inspired and there are no mistakes.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:06.960]   And when he puts sanctification before justification in these terms, he's doing so quite deliberately.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.400]   In other words, "sanctification" there does not mean what it means, for instance, in the
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.560]   first chapter of that same epistle and in verse 30, where he says, "But of him are ye
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:26.040]   in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, even righteousness, sanctification,
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   and redemption."
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.160]   Now, there's the typical theological order.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.360]   Righteousness, justification, sanctification, meaning progressive sanctification, redemption,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   meaning glorification.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.440]   That's the order.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.640]   But here you see it's got a different order.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.880]   "Washed," "sanctified," "justified."
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.040]   So that there it doesn't mean what sanctification normally means.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:55.640]   It means, I suggest, once more, exactly the same thing as we have in Acts 15 in the ninth
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.200]   verse and in Acts 28 in verse 18.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.800]   But let me give you another one.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:08.560]   Take the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the second chapter, and the thirteenth verse.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.200]   Two Thessalonians 2, 13.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.960]   "But we are bound to give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:26.120]   God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.560]   and belief of the truth."
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.960]   You notice the order?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.840]   Sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.040]   He puts sanctification of the Spirit before the belief in the truth.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:50.760]   Well, now, there's only one possible way to expound that accurately and properly.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.280]   It is not referring to sanctification in its general New Testament sense.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.280]   What he's saying is this.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   Look here.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.440]   He says, "I thank God for this, brethren and beloved of the Lord, because God hath
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.480]   from the beginning chosen you to salvation."
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.760]   How has he done it?
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:14.920]   "Well, he separated you by his Spirit to belief of the truth."
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.840]   That's exactly what the Spirit does.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.720]   Here is a mass of people listening to an evangelistic sermon.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.200]   At the end of the sermon, some have believed and some have not believed.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.880]   Why is it that some have believed?
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.520]   It is because the Spirit has sanctified them.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.040]   The Spirit has set them apart.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.400]   He's called them out.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.300]   It is the call of the Spirit.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.440]   It is the work of the Spirit in conviction and calling out and giving the power to believe.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.180]   That's what sanctification means, setting apart.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.400]   As the mountain was set apart and is called the Holy Mount, these are set apart by the
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:54.840]   Spirit and that's the process, setting apart of the Spirit and belief of the truth as the
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.160]   result of that.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.680]   It's exactly the same thing once more, but let me give you another.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.760]   This is really a very vital matter because there are people, honest and sincere, who
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.360]   misinterpreting these two verses are thus persuading themselves that they're entirely
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.520]   sanctified and when they subsequently fall into sin and people know that they do, they
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.400]   themselves sometimes feel that they've never been Christians at all or that they've sinned
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.560]   against the Holy Ghost and the others look on and say, "There's your perfect person
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   for you.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.720]   There's your heart that was pure and full of love and entire sanctification.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   Look at it."
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.520]   And it does grievous harm to the Christian cause.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.960]   That's why I'm going through it so carefully.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.480]   But take the statement in 1 Peter, the first chapter and the second verse.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.520]   Here the apostle, as I've already reminded you, is writing to a number of strangers scattered
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   abroad.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   He doesn't even know them.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   What does he say?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.040]   Well, he says, "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:02.880]   Pontus, Galatia, etc., elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:11.680]   sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.640]   The same order again.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.240]   How have these people become Christians?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.880]   Here's the method.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.120]   Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   How has he done it?
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.920]   Well, through, by means of, the sanctification of the Spirit.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   What for?
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.400]   Well, unto.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   The Spirit puts them on one side.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:36.320]   He does his gracious work in them in order that they may give obedience unto the truth
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:43.560]   concerning the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, whereby a man's sins are remitted
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.820]   and he becomes a child of God.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:52.340]   But you notice, it is through sanctification of the Spirit unto belief and obedience.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.260]   Whereas we know that with the doctrine of sanctification as generally expounded, you
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:04.380]   believe first and are justified, and then your sanctification follows and goes on progressively.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:10.500]   There is only one possible way in which all these verses can be explained.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.220]   But if you want something which really should settle it for you once and forever, you've
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:20.220]   got to go to the twenty-second verse in that same first chapter of the first epistle of
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   Peter.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.580]   Now, listen to this.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:29.780]   One Peter, one twenty-two.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.820]   Let me go a bit further back, perhaps.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.540]   Verse eighteen, "Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.340]   as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.380]   with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.500]   verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:59.180]   times for you, who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.740]   him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:15.460]   Knowing that you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:21.740]   unfamed love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a fervent love fervently."
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.420]   You notice what he says, don't you?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:32.020]   He here says, the apostle says at this point, that these Gentiles have purified their own
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.300]   souls by believing.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.780]   But you see, that's the very thing Peter was arguing in the Council of Jerusalem.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.940]   He said, "I'll tell you why I baptized Cornelius and his household.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.580]   God purified their hearts by faith."
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:51.100]   But here he says that they purified their own hearts, their own souls, by believing
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   the truth.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.540]   Of course, it means exactly the same thing.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.540]   He is saying in both instances that God has given these people the gift of faith, and
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.380]   in exercising it, they have purified their hearts.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:11.620]   What purifies the heart is the belief, the faith, the obedience to the truth.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:18.060]   And so the apostle is equally right in saying here that they have purified their own souls
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:23.100]   in obeying the truth through the Spirit of God.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.060]   It's always through the Spirit.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.780]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.780]   unto him.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.940]   No man believes this truth except through the Spirit.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.820]   The Spirit does this separating work, this calling out, and then in believing our hearts
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.820]   are purified.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.780]   It's no longer an evil heart of unbelief.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.880]   By believing, you purify your heart.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.260]   So it doesn't matter whether it is said that your heart is purified or that you have
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.540]   purified your own heart.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.420]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:01.220]   Now that 1 Peter 1.22 is surely enough in and of itself to settle this matter once and
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.500]   forever.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.820]   So if a man comes to you and says, "Look here, it says in Acts 15.9, purifying their
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.820]   hearts by faith.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:13.060]   It says that God purified their hearts simply on their faith to accept it."
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:18.940]   You say the answer to that is in 1 Peter 1.22, the same speaker who says that they purified
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.420]   their own souls by obedience unto the truth through the Spirit.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:33.940]   So that there is really no ground whatsoever for this teaching, that those two verses would
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:41.660]   have us believe in the possibility of entire sanctification by faith at any moment.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.860]   They are not concerned to teach anything of the sort, and they most certainly do not do
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.860]   so.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:52.940]   Then, having dealt with it directly like that, I want to just give you one quotation
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.500]   which supports it all indirectly.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.620]   And now you have to go to the first epistle to the Corinthians, to chapter 7 and verse
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.760]   14.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:11.460]   This is the great chapter in which the apostle deals with the married relationship in people
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.140]   who have become Christians.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:18.780]   You remember, many of these early Christians thought that if one of them had become a Christian,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.180]   he or she should leave the unconverted partner.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.380]   And the apostle's teaching is that that is quite wrong.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.820]   He puts it like this, "If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.660]   to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:40.260]   And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her,
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.060]   let her not leave him.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:53.180]   For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:31:01.380]   by the husband, else were your children unclean, but now they are holy."
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.340]   Now here's the most important verse, isn't it?
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.820]   You see, these friends will come to you and say, "Now they'll say, look here, you don't
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.620]   believe the scripture, you don't take scripture as it is, you are putting your exposition
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.900]   over the scripture.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.700]   When the scripture says 'purify', it means purify.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.460]   When the scripture says 'sanctify', it means sanctify.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.620]   So if it says that their hearts were purified by faith, it means that they were absolutely
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.460]   cleansed from all sin.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.380]   If it is said that they're going to have an inheritance, a joint inheritance among them
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.060]   that are sanctified by faith that is in me, sanctified means sanctified, and it means
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.420]   that they're absolutely cleansed from all sin.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:43.180]   Well, the simple answer to that is 1 Corinthians 7, verse 14, where the same word is used,
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.180]   remember.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.500]   The unbelieving husband, here's a man who's not a Christian at all, we are told he is
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.220]   sanctified by the wife, sanctified means sanctified.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.500]   So the unbelieving husband is entirely cleansed from sin.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.100]   You see how ludicrous it is, how utterly ridiculous it is.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.100]   We mustn't argue like that and say, "Here's the word, it must mean..."
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.060]   It doesn't, you must take your context.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:12.900]   You see, language is always insufficient in these matters, and the same word has to be
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.340]   used with several different connotations.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.340]   But if you only pay attention to your context, you'll never be in trouble.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.660]   We are told here that these children of one or the other of these believing parents are
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.860]   holy, they're no longer unclean, and it can only have one meaning.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.140]   It doesn't mean that they're entirely sanctified, it means this, that they're allowed to come
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.180]   into the church, they're allowed to come amongst God's people, the Christians, while they're
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.300]   worshipping in their churches.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.140]   It means nothing more, cannot mean anything more.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.240]   And that is, of course, all that it is intended to believe.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:53.100]   So these terms, as you find them in these different places, all are teaching the same
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.540]   thing.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:02.740]   So we deduce this, that all we've got in those two statements in the book of Acts,
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:10.340]   Acts 15, 9 and 26, 18, is just this, that they have been set apart.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.820]   Now I want to quote to you the words which are in this newest and best lexicon by Arndt
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.820]   and Gingrich.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:26.060]   They say it means this, "to include in the inner circle of what is holy in both religious
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.260]   and moral uses of the word."
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.260]   Nothing more.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.380]   That you're allowed to belong to this particular company.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:39.180]   Indeed, they go on and say another thing which is very important.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:46.140]   These words which are translated by either "purify" or "sanctify" or "make holy"
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.220]   are what are described as "cultic" words.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.620]   Cultic, not Celtic, but cultic.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.140]   C-U-L-T-I-C.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:02.620]   And that means, of course, that they've always got an association with the various
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:09.780]   mystery religions and other religions that were known in the world in New Testament days.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:16.260]   The pagans had their various religions, you read about it in Greek mythology and so on.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:25.980]   Now these words always have this cultic association, and they always conjure up the notion of some
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:35.300]   ritual ceremony or some process of initiation into the circle of the devotees of that particular
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.980]   religion.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.780]   Now similar things are happening in the modern world.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.820]   I don't know, but I'm told that people who become Freemasons have to be initiated.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.100]   Whatever it may mean, whatever they do, I don't know.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.640]   But it's a part of the same idea.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.620]   You get initiated into the circle, and there are various ways in which people used to be
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.500]   initiated of old, and you couldn't belong to that particular religion unless you'd
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   been initiated.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.140]   An animal might be killed and the blood put over you, or various other things.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:11.840]   Now all these words are saying is this, that the way of initiation into the Christian church
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.700]   and into the kingdom and the family of God is by faith.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.460]   That's all they're saying, nothing more.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.740]   You're no longer unclean, not in the sense that you're not perfectly sanctified.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:30.820]   No, no, outside the kingdom of God we are all unclean.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.340]   So to come into the kingdom of God you have to be cleansed in the sense you are washed,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.900]   you are sanctified.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.820]   And thus you are brought in.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.620]   It's the initiation.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:47.260]   You are introduced, and it is always, since the coming of our Lord and his perfect work,
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.980]   a matter of faith.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:36:00.060]   Faith and faith alone admits into this relationship to God which is found in and through our Lord
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.400]   and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.380]   So purifying their hearts by faith means that.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.380]   Sanctified by faith that is in me means exactly the same thing.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:17.140]   And of course, you've noticed this I have no doubt as I've been expanding these statements.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:25.620]   In all these examples and illustrations the reference has been to all Christians.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.460]   Now when Peter was talking there in the council at Jerusalem he was saying something about
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:36.700]   all those who had believed with Cornelius in his house, all of them, and all other Gentiles
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.760]   who had believed subsequently.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:46.580]   In exactly the same way it is stated of all the members of the church at Corinth that
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.180]   they had thus been washed and sanctified.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:56.220]   The Lord in giving his commission to the Apostle tells them that this will happen to all Gentiles
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.220]   who believe.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:03.100]   All Gentiles who exercise faith in him shall have this share in the inheritance amongst
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.020]   all these who are sanctified.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.100]   It is always universal.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.580]   Peter in writing to those strangers scattered abroad was writing to all of them, all the
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:19.020]   members of the churches, all Christians in all those countries.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:25.860]   But you see according to this other teaching all Christians are not sanctified by faith.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.460]   It's a second and a special blessing.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.940]   They say all Christians are justified.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.500]   But they say it is only some who are sanctified by faith.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:41.780]   They are the people who believe their teaching and therefore go in for the second blessing.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.220]   So they say it doesn't apply to all, it only applies to some.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:51.540]   Whereas the two verses which they quote are universal and all the other verses are equally
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.980]   universal in their application.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:03.900]   So that from every conceivable standpoint there is no shred of evidence whatsoever for
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:11.340]   this teaching that the baptism of the Spirit means entire sanctification by faith.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.380]   Now you see the subtlety of the thing.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   Look at Acts 15.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:20.300]   Peter is there saying, "When I saw that the Holy Ghost had come upon these people,
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.140]   when I saw that they had received the same gift as we received at the beginning," and
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:29.860]   he's referring to Acts 2 and the day of Pentecost, he's talking about the baptism of the Holy
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   Ghost.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.340]   And then he goes on to say purifying their hearts by faith.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.420]   They put the two together and they say that's it.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   The baptism of the Holy Spirit means entire sanctification, purification of the heart,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.860]   entire eradication of sin, complete holiness.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.660]   How subtle it all is.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:54.260]   But if you only take trouble and are careful, you will see how it doesn't follow at all
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.140]   and two things are coalesced which would never be.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.500]   However, let me give you some further proofs.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.820]   Surely the state of the Church at Corinth and elsewhere proves that what I'm saying
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.780]   must be absolutely right.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.980]   Who would like to say that the members of the Church in Corinth were entirely sanctified?
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.340]   Why in that very sixth chapter where the Apostle reminds them that they'd been washed and
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:26.860]   sanctified, he's also warning them to be very careful as to how they lived.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.420]   Be not deceived, he says, God is not mocked.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.220]   Don't you play with this thing?
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.820]   Realize what you're doing, he says.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:41.580]   They have need for much teaching about the way of sanctification.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:46.540]   And so it is with all the other New Testament epistles.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.580]   If that other teaching were right, indeed you'd never have needed these New Testament
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.860]   epistles at all.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.680]   All you'd need to do would be this.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.180]   You would address Christian people and you'd only have one message and you'd say, now
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.700]   then you've believed the gospel, you've become Christians.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:07.260]   All you've got to do now is to receive a second blessing, your entire sanctification
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.140]   by faith, and you can have it at any moment, and your heart will be entirely purified and
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.140]   cleansed.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:17.940]   You'll be utterly delivered from sin.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:23.660]   But of course what you actually find in the New Testament is something very different.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.020]   What you find in the New Testament is what we've already found in this eighth chapter
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:33.220]   of the epistle to the Romans, in verse 13, where the apostle says, 'For if ye live
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:41.900]   after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   ye shall live.'
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.100]   He doesn't tell them they can be sanctified in one act.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.740]   They've got to mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.940]   They've got to go on being led by the Spirit, he says in verse 14, and it's the same
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.500]   everywhere.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.460]   The New Testament is full of detailed exhortations.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:07.220]   Listen to James putting it, for instance, in the fourth chapter.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.380]   You remember how he puts it.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:12.980]   It's the same notion exactly, the same word is used as we've already been looking at
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.980]   this evening.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:19.820]   Here it is in the fourth chapter of James, in the eighth verse, 'Draw nigh to God and
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.740]   he will draw nigh to you.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:31.500]   Use your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.'
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.220]   You see how important it is to compare Scripture with Scripture.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.420]   Not take one verse, it says, 'Purify by faith.'
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:42.820]   Here is James telling these believers to purify their hearts.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.940]   And what does that mean?
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.740]   It means don't be double-minded.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.980]   Don't admit again that evil heart of unbelief.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.220]   It's just the same thing.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.380]   It's the same thing everywhere.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.300]   Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   Don't be double-minded.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.620]   Don't have Christ and something else.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.620]   Get rid of the other.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.620]   Purify your hearts.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   Believe only.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:07.140]   And again, as Peter tells them that they've done that themselves, James is telling them
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.860]   to do it again.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.140]   Cleanse your hands.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.140]   You've got to do it, you know.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.940]   It won't all be taken out of you.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.780]   Cleanse your hands and purify your hearts.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.180]   Be double-minded.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:28.420]   And indeed, all the New Testament epistles are full of exactly the same thing.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.580]   They're all exhorting us, 'Let him that stole, steal them all.'
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.300]   Let no filthy communications come out of your mouth.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   And where do they come from?
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.500]   Not only from the mouth.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.260]   What comes out from the mouth, says Christ, comes out of the heart.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.100]   So you've got to wage this battle.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.580]   It tells us not to do certain things, to do other things.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:52.540]   This is wrong if there's such a thing as being cleansed entirely from all sin and given
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.200]   a pure heart in one act.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.540]   It makes the Scriptures, I say, not only ridiculous, it makes them unnecessary even.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.340]   And therefore it is entirely wrong.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.860]   Very well, I close by putting it like this.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:10.580]   What then is the relationship between this experience of sealing of the Spirit or baptism
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.260]   of the Spirit or the testimony of the Spirit with our spirit?
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.660]   What is the relationship between that and sanctification?
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.180]   And my answer is this.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.460]   It has no direct association.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.840]   It has no direct relationship.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:31.660]   But it has a very important indirect one and a very great indirect one.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:32.660]   What is it?
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.700]   Well, it's this.
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.820]   Take this experience which has been described to us in the many quotations I have read to
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.620]   you as well as in the Scripture.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.620]   What do they all say?
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.620]   Well, they say this.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:52.620]   They say, "When the Spirit bore witness with my spirit that I was a child of God,
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.700]   I was aware that I was in the presence of the Holy God.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.720]   Everything was light.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.460]   Everything was pure.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.020]   Everything was clean.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.100]   Everything was holy.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.220]   The whole atmosphere was light and holiness."
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.400]   And of course, at the same moment, they felt this.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.540]   They felt that they were very sinful.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.360]   Not only that, they hated sin.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.700]   They never wanted to sin again.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.180]   They felt an utter, complete abhorrence to it at that moment.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:32.380]   Of course, in the presence of God, their hearts went out to Him in love and they wanted to
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.360]   live only to Him and to His glory and to His praise.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.980]   They felt they would never sin again.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:45.380]   But alas, that doesn't mean, you know, that even at that moment their heart was entirely
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.100]   cleansed from sin.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.760]   No, no.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.600]   It was that the presence of the Lord made sin unthinkable.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.980]   But in their hearts, in their beings, they are still the same.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:01.420]   Still there is sin in the members, in this mortal body that we have been reading about
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.160]   in chapter 7.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.980]   That remains the same.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:11.140]   But it's very easy, therefore, to understand how people should feel that at that moment
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:15.140]   they were entirely cleansed from sin.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:20.820]   But don't we know something about this in our most ordinary experiences?
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.600]   Don't you feel you're a better person when you're talking to a saint?
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:29.180]   And haven't you sometimes felt when you're talking to a very saintly person that sin
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.420]   is utterly unthinkable?
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.860]   Of course.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.740]   They have a cleansing effect upon you.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.420]   They have a purifying effect.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   As you're with them, you feel, "I'll never sin again."
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.780]   But you know it hasn't changed your constitution.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.480]   You're still the same person.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.740]   And you may leave such a person, and before you know what you've done, you've sinned.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:49.740]   Isn't that experience?
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:55.100]   Well, it was the experience of these New Testament people, these members of the church at Corinth,
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.380]   who were to be worn so stringently in this powerful manner.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:06.400]   These people had received the baptism of the Spirit, but it doesn't guarantee sanctification.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.860]   It doesn't guarantee holiness.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.500]   But it does stimulate it, but it promotes it.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.580]   It's the greatest possible help to it.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:21.300]   Because you remember we saw that all these people have testified that they've had a sense
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.620]   of the glory that was awaiting them.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.680]   They've had a glimpse of it.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.900]   And what's the result of that?
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:31.820]   Well, John tells us in his first epistle, third chapter, third verse, "Every man that
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:38.620]   hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:43.100]   Everything that brings us nearer to the Lord gives us a sense of his glory, of his love
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.300]   to us, and of his holiness, and of what he's preparing for us.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:53.460]   Stimulates us to be more sanctified, to cleanse ourselves, to prepare for what's coming.
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.820]   So it stimulates sanctification.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.020]   It encourages us to it.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.020]   But it doesn't do it.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.460]   It doesn't guarantee it automatically.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.100]   It doesn't cause it to happen within us.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:13.260]   It is simply the mightiest and the greatest stimulus and help of all to sanctification.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.980]   Will you forgive me if, as I close, I put it in the form of an illustration that I once
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:24.100]   ventured to use in this pulpit when I was dealing with this matter in another context?
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.620]   I venture to suggest that the relationship between this experience of the testimony of
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:34.660]   the Spirit to sanctification is comparable to this.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:41.380]   Imagine a farmer or a gardener sowing seed into the ground.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.780]   Anything you like, doesn't matter what.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:48.260]   He's been digging or plowing, he's harrowed, put in the seed, covered it over, flattened
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.540]   it out.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:54.140]   And then he waits for something to appear, but weeks pass, nothing happens.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:48:00.100]   It's particularly dry weather, coldish weather, nothing at all happens.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:05.180]   At long last it just begins to sprout and appear above the ground.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.180]   And then it seems to stop at that stage.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.380]   It doesn't seem to move, doesn't seem to grow.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.820]   And he begins to wonder whether it's alive or not.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.140]   Nothing happens at all.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:23.980]   And then suddenly there's a wonderful burst of sunshine in the spring, with perhaps a
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.980]   shower thrown in.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.900]   And you go and look at that plot which you looked at before.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.140]   You went to business in the morning, you go back after you've had your tea in the evening,
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.700]   and it's sprouted up.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.100]   You've almost seen it growing.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.100]   Wonderful.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.300]   What's the explanation?
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.100]   Oh, it's this, you see.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.900]   There was life there the whole time, but it was very feeble.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.980]   There was life in the seed.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.980]   Though there didn't seem to be much, it was there.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.420]   Oh, it was certainly there.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.820]   And you couldn't see anything happening, though there was life there.
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:03.940]   Ah, but the sunshine comes, and the shower comes, and the life springs up.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:09.300]   More happens in one afternoon than had happened in the previous weeks.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.140]   That's the relationship.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.060]   The sunshine and the rain are the Spirit bearing witness with our spirits.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.340]   The love of God shared abroad in the heart.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.860]   And as these men have agreed in saying, in one hour of this experience, they felt they'd
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.580]   got more than they'd had in fifty years before, some of them.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.900]   That's it.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:38.060]   You see, the effect of the rain and the sunshine is to stimulate, to draw out what's there.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.380]   It's exactly the same with the Christians.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.060]   The moment we are born again, this process of sanctification has already started.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.460]   The seed of life and of holiness is there.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:59.060]   Yes, but this of all things is the one that causes it to jump up, to grow and to develop,
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:03.820]   and to spring up in a manner that amazes everybody.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.460]   That's the relationship.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.060]   It's not direct.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.180]   It's not immediate.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.740]   It is indirect.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:20.740]   It is the greatest stimulus to sanctification, but it is not sanctification itself.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.740]   Let us pray.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:33.260]   O Lord, our God, we do again thank Thee for Thy Word and for its truth.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.340]   Forgive us, O Lord, that we are so slow to exercise our senses with regard to these things
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:47.340]   as we should, and that as the result we remain children or else are led astray into by-paths
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:54.300]   which lead to unhappiness and misery, and oft times to bring Thy very name and cause
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.340]   and word into disrepute.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:04.460]   O God, forgive us that we give so little of our time and exercise these abilities.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.860]   Thou hast given us so little about these matters.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.740]   We thank Thee for Thy Word.
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.540]   We thank Thee for Thy blessed Spirit.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:21.700]   O Lord, give us, we humbly pray Thee, a deeper and a richer understanding.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:29.940]   Enable us to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord, that we may thus be worthy children
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:37.460]   of Thine and worthy representatives of Thy Church and of Thy precious truth.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:43.940]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:50.740]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:58.180]   of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see Him
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:10.740]   as He is and be like Him, perfect, entirely sanctified, glorified in glory.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.820]   Amen.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.740]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
