[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940]   So today I want to talk about one of the most important skills you can have as a human.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.480]   Something that I think most of the most interesting, successful, and impactful people I know are
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.100]   very good at, and I'm talking about thinking.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.780]   Now this may sound stupid at first because we all think all the time, our minds are worrying
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.760]   all the time, if anything our problem is getting away from our own thoughts, but when I say
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.360]   think here I mean something very specific, I mean giving sustained attention to potentially
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.880]   complicated or ambiguous information with the ultimate goal of building a new conceptual
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.980]   structure that has value to yourself or to the world.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.140]   This is what I mean by thinking.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.520]   Now here's the thing, most people are very bad at this brand of serious thinking.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.940]   The way most people go through their lives is as follows, first they outsource any sort
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.640]   of normative or ethical thinking to online tribal vibes and approval.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.680]   I don't know, what does my team think?
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   Do they like this?
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   They don't like this?
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.800]   What's going to get me not yelled at?
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.520]   What's going to get me approved?
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.880]   That's about as far as I want to go trying to actually build up some sort of framework
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.360]   for understanding what I stand for, what's good and what's bad.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.600]   Most people prioritize a sort of high energy emotion in the moment over the subtler satisfactions
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.800]   of real understanding and appreciation.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.520]   They want to just feel something, and often their phone can give them that something quite
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.720]   easily.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.840]   They don't want to do the work for actually deeply engaging with something beautiful.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.880]   Most people also gravitate when it comes towards the realm of accomplishment towards checklist
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.120]   productivity.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.040]   Just give me a list of things I can follow where the key here is that the information
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.640]   is scarce, and I have a special list of things to do, and then I'll be in great shape, or
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.480]   then my web business will take off, or then I'll make six figures per month.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   Just give me a checklist.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.560]   I want secret information that I found online as opposed to seeking out to produce things
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.360]   that are unambiguously valuable.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.240]   Serious thinkers live differently.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.720]   They have a deep and evolving understanding of the world, what's good, what's bad, and
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.200]   what it means to live a good life.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.560]   They appreciate the beautiful.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.320]   They appreciate the quality, and they find inspiration in it.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.120]   Their output is often slower, but when it does come out, it's more impact, and it engenders
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.840]   more respect.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.720]   So if you're interested in the deep life, serious thinking needs to be a goal that you
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   are pursuing.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.160]   So here's what I want to do today is help you become a more serious thinker, and I want
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   to do that in a practical way.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.640]   I have five different practices.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.240]   Each of these are concrete that I want to run through.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.360]   These are all things you can start doing right away in your own life that if you stick with
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.920]   them, you will find after a month, your cognitive abilities are much better than they were before.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.840]   After six months, the experience of your day to day life is going to be notably different
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   and richer, and after a year or so, you're going to find yourself actually able to produce
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.000]   ideas for yourself and the world that have real value.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.320]   Really you're going to unlock major options.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.080]   So it's worth becoming a serious thinker.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.560]   Let's go through five practices for how to do it.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560]   I'm going to illustrate, for those of you who are watching instead of just listening,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.400]   by popular demand, I will illustrate what we're doing here.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.440]   So on the screen, I'm going to put in the center my world famous picture of a brain.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.400]   So what we got here is a cerebellum, and we got some wrinkles and folds in the brain.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.920]   So I have a brain in the center, and I'm going to illustrate around this.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.240]   I'll put one expertly drawn icon per practice we are going to discuss.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   All right, so the first practice that I want to discuss is to improve the quality and decrease
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.920]   the quantity of information that you consume.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.080]   So to illustrate this with an icon, I'm going to expertly draw here, the Twitter T. I know
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.480]   they've switched to X, but I sort of am boycotting that.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.960]   So I'm drawing a T, and I'll put in a circle with a line through it.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.560]   I'm going to indicate consuming better quality and less quantity of information.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   So what does this mean?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   I'm talking particularly here about news or other information you use to learn more things
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.920]   about the world.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.880]   Stop using social media algorithms to curate your news flow.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.160]   Social media algorithms are bad curators.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.440]   Their interest is not making you as informed as possible.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.600]   Their interest is making you as engaged as possible to make you as engaged as possible.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.200]   They are going to push you to places that are not emotionally healthy.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.280]   It's also not going to lead you to the most nuanced understanding of issues.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.980]   I want you instead to focus on a multi-scale news and information consumption.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.400]   So I want your news and information consumption to be divided over three scales, daily, monthly,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   and seasonal.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.480]   And here's what I mean by that.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.660]   Daily have a very small number, probably just one sources of quality, non-algorithmically
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.600]   curated news and information.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.000]   This could be one of the growing number of daily news roundup newsletters.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.120]   I like, for example, if you're a subscriber to the New York Times, I think David Leonhardt's
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.320]   Daily News Summary is a fantastic one.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.520]   I'm saying this mainly because they featured my profile from the New York Times Magazine
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   from last year.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   They re-featured it recently in that newsletter, so we know that's expertly curated.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.380]   It could be a daily news roundup podcast.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.800]   It could be a physical newspaper that you pick up or have delivered.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.160]   At the monthly scale, you spend the time to go through a collection of, let's say, two
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.800]   to six in-depth long-form magazine articles.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.560]   So now, this is still relatively current, but not day-to-day current.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.640]   This is now information where enough time has passed for a professional journalist or
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.680]   writer to actually spend some time to really digest information about what's going on in
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.560]   the world and produce and have edited a long-form piece.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.900]   Now we're at a lag of a month or so from what's actually going on.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.000]   This is where, for example, you can pull out a few selected articles from my own journalistic
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.520]   home, which is the New Yorker, maybe you pull out some long-form articles from the Atlantic
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.160]   or Foreign Affairs or the National Review or the Wall Street Journal's Sunday issue,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.960]   whatever it is that you particularly follow.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.440]   It could be print, could be not print, tablet magazine.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.000]   I'm just thinking of different things I've pulled from before, and you're like, "Here's
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.720]   my six articles I've gathered throughout the month, 3,000, 5,000 word beast.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.880]   I'm going to go to a coffee shop somewhere.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   I've got these printed out," and let's just engage at this slower scale, deeper understanding,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.480]   slower scale.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.920]   Now we jump up to the seasonal scale, and this is books.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.400]   When there's something going on in the world you care about, you should get a book written
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.440]   by an expert, someone who has spent years working on this artifact based on many more
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.960]   years of actually engaging with this topic, and you get this beautiful artifact here that
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.080]   you can hold and consume in about a week or two that is going to give you as deep or nuanced
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.460]   as an understanding of a topic as you're ever likely to get outside of actually studying
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.720]   that topic professionally yourself.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.520]   You should at the seasonal scale have a book that you're reading on whatever thing is going
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.760]   on in the world that is most important to you.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:54.860]   Let's take this multi-scale information consumption plan out for a spin with a particular topic.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.060]   Let's compare it to what most people would normally do.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.360]   Let's talk about fears about AI.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   Now, what you could do, which is what most people do, is let me read a lot of tweets
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.920]   and histrionic YouTube videos and short articles on the online news sites.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.420]   They're all like, "Oh my God, Google Gemini is doing this, ChatGPT just did that, Sam
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.040]   Altman just said this," and there's this sort of just frenzied sense of, "Oh, this is very
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.440]   uneasy and I don't know what's going on, and I'm kind of stressed all the time."
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.840]   What would it look like to engage this topic with a multi-scale information consumption
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   approach?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.400]   Well, you would be getting daily information.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.720]   When something important happened, it would be covered in whatever your high-quality non-algorithmically
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.280]   curated source of news would be.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.880]   When Sam Altman, for example, got fired and then rehired, David Leonhardt's newsletter
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.120]   covered that, so you would get the main points.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.280]   You're subscribed to Axios's daily news roundup, you would get the main points.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.760]   Then on the seasonal scale, you could actually say, "Let me sit down with, for example, the
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.840]   New Yorker's recent AI issue, and read some of these longer form pieces.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.760]   Let me sit down and listen to, you know, Ezra Klein had a fantastic AI podcast recently
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:11.400]   with Kevin Roos and Casey Newhoff, I think, and let's just spend an hour and 20 minutes
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.620]   just sort of walking through what we know, maybe go back and finally read my New Yorker
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.760]   piece on the guts of how ChatGPT actually works."
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.120]   This is not so frenzied, this is more digested information, like, "Okay, I'm getting some
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.240]   deeper sense of what's going on."
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:32.360]   On the scale of a season, you say, "I'm going to read a book about artificial intelligence,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.200]   maybe about the alignment problem or how people are thinking about its role in society," and
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.320]   now get like a really measured, deeper understanding of it.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.040]   That is how multiscale information consumption works.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.700]   Serious thinkers are going to consume information that way, they have no interest for algorithmically
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.560]   curated social media information.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.400]   The same thing, though, applies, I'm going to say this, in improvement of quality, decreasing
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.720]   a quantity, we can think of this also applying to other types of information as well.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.880]   Think about shows or movies you watch on streaming services.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.200]   To increase the quality of that, simple heuristic, one-to-one ratio, fun smart.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.160]   "Hey, quick interruption.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:21.360]   If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate the deep life, go
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.440]   to calnewport.com/ideas or click the link right below in the description."
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.400]   This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here on this
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   show.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.960]   All right, let's get back to it.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   If I watch a movie that is just pure fun, I want to watch something that's going to
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:46.000]   challenge me, either artistically, this is a well-respected movie, or informationally,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.800]   it's a documentary on something that's complicated, but I want to know about it.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.760]   One-to-one ratio, so that the quality of what you're engaging in the streaming media gets
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   better.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   You can do the same thing with podcasts.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.120]   Here's a fun podcast, one-to-one ratio with something that I'm learning from, et cetera.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   All right, practice number two, increase your comfort with boredom.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.480]   Let's draw a picture for this one as well.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.280]   What I'm going to draw here is a rock.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.680]   All right, there we go.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.960]   Standing on this rock, we see someone contemplating.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.480]   Jesse appreciates my artwork.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.600]   Increase comfort with boredom.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.680]   What is the idea here before we get even more specific about the practices?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.720]   If your brain is used to this idea that it is never bored, that when it lacks novel stimuli,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.080]   you will always feed it a shiny digital treat in the form typically of your phone or an
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.040]   iPad or a browser tab, that's going to give you something emotionally salient in the moment.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.480]   It can't tolerate serious thinking because serious thinking requires you to keep your
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.940]   attention sustained, this inner eye of your attention sustained on a single abstract topic.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.340]   That's boring because there's not a lot of novel stimuli.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.000]   Your brain has to be comfort with boredom.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.440]   By increasing your comfort with boredom, you're just teaching your brain, it's not that you're
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.680]   bored all the time.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.040]   It's also not trying to put too much of a positive value on boredom.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.880]   It's just teaching your brain sometimes we're bored and sometimes we're not, and I'm comfortable
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.800]   with that state of boredom.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.520]   How can you do this?
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.040]   Two things I'm going to suggest.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.360]   One, actually have every day a particular outing or chore or task you do.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.520]   It can be short, but a particular thing you do without your phone.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.760]   Go to the drugstore, go put in your laundry.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.160]   It doesn't have to be long, taking out the garbage and do it with nothing in your ear.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.080]   You're like, "Okay, I'm just doing this activity.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.240]   There's no novel stimuli here.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.720]   I'm just having to be alone with my own thoughts."
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.640]   A lot of people who take this advice will also typically add a longer outing on the
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.040]   weekends, hour plus, no phone.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.240]   You can ramp that up over the weekend.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   The other really important thing you can do is the phone foyer method.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.480]   The idea here is when you're at your home or your apartment or wherever you live, you
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.320]   keep your phone plugged in in one place.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.640]   If you have a house with a foyer, it's in the foyer, or it's in the kitchen, if you
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.680]   have an apartment, whatever, but it stays plugged in when you're at home in one place.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.240]   If you need to look something up, you go to where it's plugged in and you look it up there.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.280]   If you need to receive or text with someone, you go where the phone is plugged in and you
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   receive and do text there, same with phone calls.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.680]   You have to go to where the phone is.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.680]   It is not where you are.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.640]   Now, this is going to be annoying at first, but what you're doing here is severing this
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.200]   permanent accessibility of the distraction.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.640]   So now when you're watching something or doing something in your own house or in your own
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.520]   apartment, you can't pull out the phone.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.560]   It's somewhere else.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.800]   You still have the benefits of I need to look this thing up, but you have to walk 10 feet
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.280]   to go do it.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.640]   You're going to get more mini moments of boredom during your evenings and mornings at home.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.400]   Very important if you want to prepare your brain to be a serious thinker.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.760]   All right.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.440]   Third thing I want to suggest here, third practice for becoming a more serious thinker.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.520]   Cultivate your ability to pay attention.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.920]   So illustrate this here.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.320]   You won't know at first what this means.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:30.000]   So provocatively what I'm drawing here is stopwatch.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Is there something on the top, Jesse?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Let's do this.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Perfect rendition of a stopwatch.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.160]   Why am I drawing a stopwatch?
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.200]   Because one of the first things I'm going to recommend for cultivating your ability to
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.120]   pay attention is interval training.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.480]   So actually increasing the timed intervals at which you're comfortable giving sustained
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.060]   attention to a single target.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.320]   These intervals should be intense.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.680]   You only increase the time of the intervals as you get comfortable with the current duration,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   right?
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.960]   So what we're trying to do here is get your mind comfortable with sustaining attention.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:12.160]   So the previous practice, getting a comfort for boredom, we think of that as the table
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.760]   stakes, the foundation.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.880]   Your mind has to be okay with not having a lot of stimuli.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.520]   This practice now about focusing and practicing the actual activity of focus.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.800]   The actual activity of sustaining attention.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.680]   So you have to be able to do it and then you have to actually practice what this actually
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   feels like.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.120]   So with interval training, you can do this with multiple activities.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.160]   It could be a difficult work or school activity.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.920]   It can also be, and I think this is critical, a high quality leisure activity like watching
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.840]   a movie, which a lot of people, especially young people right now, have a very hard time
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.520]   doing for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time without actually looking at their phone.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.660]   It's gonna be a high quality leisure activity or a difficult work activity to be reading
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.960]   a book, even anything that requires focus.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.920]   You start with an interval that you're comfortable with.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.440]   Keep it small at first, maybe even just 10 minutes.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.280]   You use a real timer.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.000]   Set that timer and might as well do it on your phone, by the way, because you want your
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.040]   phone right there in timer mode.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.600]   So you know for a fact if you use your phone because you've left the timer mode on your
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.000]   phone.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.720]   Set that timer for 10 minutes and work on that work task, watch that movie, or read
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:26.880]   that book with as much concentration as you can muster, zero checks of anything screened
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.840]   outside of your target until that timer goes off.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.640]   If you break that concentration and say, "I just have to check Twitter.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.680]   I just have to see what's going on in my text messages," you have to start that timer and
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   start it over.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.200]   It doesn't count.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.840]   Once you're able to consistently hit the current time duration, you increase it by 10 minutes.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   So this is just literally training the thing you want to be better at, sustaining attention
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.800]   on cognitive tasks, the absence of stimuli, sustaining the attention.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.720]   You got to just train your brain what that feels like.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.680]   Another thing you can do when it comes to cultivating your ability to pay attention
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.640]   is more passive, which is care about ritual, care about environment.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.600]   Set up this is where I go to read, and it's different than where I just sit and work or
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   watch TV.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.160]   I've set up a very special chair, and I have this light here, and it's by a warm radiator
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.520]   in the winter.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.480]   This is where I go to work on deep work challenges versus just regular work or email.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.120]   I have a separate part of my house.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.280]   I went up to the attic, and I've renovated an eave there, and that's where I go to do
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   deep work.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.520]   It's different than where I do my email and where the printer and all the filing cabinets
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.520]   are.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:46.560]   The ritual I do before I watch a hard movie, I do a thing to get my mind into that mode.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.760]   I listen to a movie podcast while walking for 20 minutes.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.400]   Ritual and environment will help you fall into that deeper attention mode.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   Combine that with interval training.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.800]   All right, let's go to our ... Let's look at my list here.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:09.160]   Let's go to our fourth idea to help you become a serious thinker, a fourth practice, I should
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.240]   say, and this is going to be strengthen your working memory.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:25.200]   I'm going to draw here is a person very determinedly walking, just because he loves my art, and
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.120]   this person is thinking about all sorts of things.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.080]   Why am I drawing a person walking?
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.240]   Because my number one tip for increasing your working memory is productive meditation.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.080]   This is an idea that goes all the way back to my 2016 book, Deep Work.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:47.400]   With productive meditation, you take a professional problem, or it could be a complicated personal
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.520]   problem, but a clear complicated problem.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.200]   You go for a walk, and you try to make progress on that problem only using your head.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.480]   The walking helps you do this.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.640]   If you're just sitting and thinking, it's much more difficult, but the walking actually
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.120]   quiets some noises in your cognitive circuit, so it's a little bit easier to focus.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.480]   Every time you notice your attention wander away from the problem that you're trying to
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.640]   make progress on in your head, you notice that wandering, and you move your attention
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.200]   back to the problem.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.180]   This forces you to get very comfortable holding lots of information in your head and trying
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:22.040]   to manipulate it and generate new information based on it.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.240]   You can make these walks longer and longer as you get more comfortable with this exercise.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.600]   This is directly increasing your working memory strength.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.560]   Your working memory strength is critical to being a serious thinker.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.200]   Serious thinking requires you to pull multiple pieces of information and hold onto them in
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.520]   your mind's eye.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.440]   This piece, but also this piece, and this piece is over here, and how do these things
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.080]   relate, and then how do I connect that to this other thing I thought before?
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.400]   Working memory is at the core of deep thoughts.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.360]   Most people have a bad working memory, however, because we're not used to holding a lot of
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.500]   stuff in our head in a way that we can actually access them with our mind's eye.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.640]   Active meditation is direct and intense practice for exactly this problem.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.280]   It gets exactly to the heart of what you're trying to do here.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.600]   All right, we've got one more practice to help you become a serious thinker.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.280]   I'm going to draw one more picture.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:25.440]   This final practice, I'm going to say it this way, practice being intellectual.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.000]   So let's see, let's draw our stick figure person here.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.480]   So how do we know this person is intellectual?
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   That's not going to work.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.000]   I'm going to draw him in a turtleneck, but he needs a neck, Jesse, that's the problem.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.400]   So let me give him a neck.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.200]   My stick figure person, there we go, give him a big neck.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.320]   >> You're a French accent.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.680]   >> I probably will give him a beret as well.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   >> And a pipe.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   >> Yeah, so there you go.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.320]   Turtleneck, because he's an intellectual.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.520]   All right, beret, because he's an intellectual.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   And a pipe, there you go.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.880]   Practice being an intellectual.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.520]   Now I joke by drawing this picture of like sort of a pretentious Frenchman with a pipe
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:14.320]   because intellectual is often used in modern conversation as a pejorative term.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.900]   But there's also a very specific and positive meaning here in say stance towards the world
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.460]   of information in which you are seeking out nuance and subtlety, you're also seeking out
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.960]   integration of information into complex understandings that you already have.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.320]   So to be an intellectual is that you are engaging with the world of information, trying to master
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.080]   it and integrate it.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.440]   Now if you do this for a living like I do, if you're a professor, they teach you how
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   to do this.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.640]   I mean, this is what you do for a living, but we don't talk enough about everyone else.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:55.560]   How do you practice this intellectual stance, an intellectual approach to the world of information?
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.800]   I'm going to give you two very concrete ideas that I think almost anyone can do and it's
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.440]   going to make you literally seem much smarter.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:10.400]   The first is pairing primary and secondary sources, pairing secondary and primary sources.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.000]   Okay, here's what this means.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.280]   It's most obvious with books.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.680]   So you want to read a great book, let's say.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.960]   I want to read the Odyssey.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.560]   I want to read Joyce.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.900]   I want to read Epsilon Epsilon.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.440]   The typical approach that I think professional intellectuals have, which is flawed because
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.320]   they forgot their own training, is they say, just read it.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:39.080]   Just expose yourself to the ideas and then pretend like it's really changed your life.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.480]   But that's not actually the way you learn how to engage information and draw out nuance
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.680]   and complicate it.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.000]   What you should do instead is say, okay, let me now get, before I read this hard book,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.360]   a secondary source.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   A secondary source means it's a book about the book.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.980]   So here is a book about why Faulkner is important or why Epsilon Epsilon is important.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:08.840]   Here is a book about the heroic Greek world in which Homer wrote the Odyssey and why this
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.080]   is such an important book.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   I'm going to read about the book first and then go and read the actual primary source
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.840]   itself.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.920]   You are now approaching this primary artifact with a framework for how to understand it,
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.960]   what you're looking for, what's important about it.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.780]   And this gives your brain practice seeing things at a new level.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.440]   You might not understand everything you saw in the secondary source, and you might not
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   come away saying, I completely understand this book or it's changed my life, but you've
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.720]   practiced reading multiple layers below the surface.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.280]   See, when we just tell people, read the great books, go to the museums, and you'll just
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.020]   be inspired.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.680]   We really are selling them short because that experience of inspiration requires you seeing
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.320]   multiple layers below the surface, and you got to practice that.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.440]   Secondary sources first.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   Same thing with museums.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.540]   I do not like this idea when parents have of like, all that's important is that we expose
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.840]   our child to art museums, and then they'll love art.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.460]   They're not going to come away from that loving art.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.600]   What you're really just teaching them is how to be comfortable in the social context of
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.480]   an art museum, so they'll seem cultured if they're around other people.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.440]   Staring at paintings does not make you a lover of paintings.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.760]   Reading about those paintings.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   Who was this artist?
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.800]   Why was this important?
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.100]   What was happening before when this artist came along?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.200]   What was the historical context or turmoil created by this painting?
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.960]   And then you go and see the artifact.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.800]   You have a completely different relationship with it.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.680]   So you could teach kids even, let me give you some basic information.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.320]   Who was Jackson Pollock?
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.420]   What was going on with the abstract expressionist?
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.420]   What were they fighting against?
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.520]   Why was this so exciting if you lived in Soho in 1942?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.960]   What was happening here?
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.400]   And then you see this artifact, and it's a different experience.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.480]   It's like when you go to the Smithsonian and see Judy Garland's ruby slippers, what's exciting
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.920]   about the ruby slippers is not just they're shiny, but it's like those were the things
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.920]   in Wizard of Oz.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.960]   That was a really important movie, and this famous person wore them.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.240]   That context helps.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.520]   So you get in the habit of doing this.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   You can do it with art.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520]   You can do it with books.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.680]   You can do it with movies.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.840]   I do this all the time.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.320]   Let me read five reviews about this movie.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.920]   Not like contemporary, but people looking back.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.280]   It's a great movie.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.360]   People looking back and writing essays about this movie.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.160]   Roger Ebert did a lot of this later on.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.080]   He went back and wrote this series of essays about the great movies.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.200]   The Guardian over in the UK does a lot of this.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.280]   They'll write these retrospective essays about movies that might be decades earlier, and
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.720]   then you go and watch the movie.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.560]   It's a completely different experience.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.560]   It could be modern movies.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.800]   It could be older movies.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:57.200]   You read about, for example, center focusing, and then you watch George Miller's Mad Max
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   Fury Road.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.000]   It's a completely different experience and appreciation when you just put the movie on
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.200]   without that type of knowledge about the cinematography.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.040]   Secondary sources paired with primary sources.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.600]   This is what academics do during their training.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.640]   They read and write their own secondary sources based on these primary sources.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.200]   So it becomes second nature, seeing levels below the surface on all sorts of things.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.800]   But if you're not going to a doctorate program, you're not getting this training, you have
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   to do it yourself.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.320]   It really makes your intellectual world a lot more interesting.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.360]   Here's the other thing I want to recommend for practicing being intellectual.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.200]   Maintain idea documents.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.760]   These are actual documents you maintain, like a Microsoft Word file, just in your own personal
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.440]   files, or if you're a good handwriter, you could do this in journals, and you have particular
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:49.320]   topics that you are recording and updating a summary in your own words of your best understanding
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   of that topic.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   These can be just general, sort of timeless topics.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.440]   Like I'm interested in Stoic philosophy, and I have this document I build out and add to
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:06.040]   about what Stoic philosophy is, who the thinkers are, what their major thoughts are, your current
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   summary of how you're thinking about Stoicism being in your own life.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.320]   You are, through writing, consolidating information, structuring information.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.640]   Now again, this is something that real intellectuals get good at doing naturally, but you have
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   to practice it.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   Writing and updating these summaries is a good way of doing it.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.160]   You can do this same thing with current event topics as well.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.000]   There's something going on in the world that you care about.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   You're like, "I don't know.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.800]   This scares me, or interests me, or it just feels important to me."
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.560]   Create and begin maintaining a document of how you feel about this and why.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:47.840]   This is a fantastic way to free yourself from the emotional ping pong game of just, "Let
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.560]   me expose myself to social media or algorithmic content.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.160]   Let me choose a tribe and make that tribe make me feel good or scared and help me get
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.840]   mad about the other tribe."
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.160]   It gets you out of that trap, and it allows you to begin building your own understanding
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   of things.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.160]   You're worried about AI.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.720]   Start building out this document.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.920]   Here's what's going on.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.240]   Here's the main types of AI.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   Here's where things are.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.320]   Here's a list of thinkers and where they stand, and this thinker is against this thinker.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.040]   You organize your thoughts.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:19.480]   You're really worried or upset or conflicted or uneasy about conflict in the Middle East.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Build out a document.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.760]   Shut down Twitter.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   Build out a document.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   Here's what's going on.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.640]   This is why I'm trying to articulate my concerns here.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.920]   I really worry about this, but this is making me feel bad as well, and this argument doesn't
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.160]   quite work, and here's why.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.880]   You're talking about arguments and where it falls short for you, where it resonates.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.000]   Build idea documents as a way of structuring.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.120]   To write is to think.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.880]   To write about what matters is to help you think about what matters, and your brain gets
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.440]   used to organizing information in the conceptual structures, so actually, I have to practice
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   being an intellectual.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.320]   All right, so if you do these five things, all of which I've beautifully illustrated
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.800]   here, you begin improving the quality and decreasing the quantity of the information
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.680]   that you consume.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.200]   You get comfort with boredom.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.220]   You do interval training for just maintaining your concentration.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.960]   You do particular training to strengthen your working memory, and you actually practice
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.180]   engaging information as an intellectual.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.000]   You can become a much more serious thinker.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.660]   It's not something you just choose to do.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.540]   It's not something you're just born to do or not.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:31.880]   It's something you cultivate, and hopefully, if you're a listener of the show, you do agree
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.880]   that this is worth cultivating because I think it is.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.000]   You see someone who's doing something cool, they're probably a serious thinker.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.720]   You see someone who's done really well for themselves, they probably have the way to
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:45.400]   do serious thought, and in this case, maybe it's applied to a business issue, a strategy,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.800]   but there's serious thought going on there.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.600]   You see someone who just has a really interesting, engaged life, they're probably a serious thinker.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.680]   They appreciate this.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.980]   They can go to the movies and love the experience.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.440]   They have things they're deeply engaged in.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.920]   Your brain is your number one portal to the world, and if you train that brain to be a
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.280]   serious thinker, your experience of the world changes the technicolor.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.240]   The font gets smaller.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.800]   The clarity gets much increased.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.980]   It's just a different sort of improved experience with life, so train it.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.400]   Train that thinking, and you will get better at it.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:28.280]   All right, Jesse, we got, I think our questions today are all pretty tightly connected, which
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   I appreciate.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.260]   They're very tightly connected to this exact theme of increased thinking, but before we
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.320]   get to those questions, let's just first hear from our sponsors.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.520]   We'll start by talking about our good friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.720]   Cozy Earth's mission is to help you find sanctuary in your daily life.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.600]   Their luxury bedding and loungewear transforms lives by offering the softest, most luxurious,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.960]   and responsibly sourced products in the world.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.520]   They start with selecting only the best suppliers with an eye towards quality, responsible production,
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.880]   and cutting edge technology, and premium materials.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.600]   I love Cozy Earth, especially Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.200]   My wife and I own multiple pairs of these sheets to ensure that when one pair is being
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.320]   washed, there is another pair that can be on the bed.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:19.180]   We do not want any gaps between Cozy Earth sheets on our beds, because we just love them
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:23.760]   more than any other sheets that we have ever had.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.600]   Their fabric is made from this thing called viscus.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:33.840]   It's a material that comes from bamboo, which gets softer and softer the more you wash it,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.000]   and it's really good at regulating temperature, so it doesn't get you hot.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.360]   I just think of it, however, as being super comfortable, so I'm just talking to you here
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.280]   from straight experience.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.480]   All Cozy Earth products can be returned or exchanged within 100 days.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.920]   They also have a 10-year warranty against defects, so if you don't like it, you can
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:58.600]   return it, no risk, but you will like it because it is super comfortable.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.960]   It has also been featured on Oprah's favorite things five years in a row.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.840]   I still have an idea, Jesse, that we should do our own favorite things before the year
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.280]   is out.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   Oprah does it.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.680]   We should do it, too.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   I like that.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:20.200]   I'm still thinking what's going to be on the list, but I'm working on it.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.440]   So look, it's the holiday season.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.760]   This is a fantastic gift.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:28.720]   We get someone some Cozy Earth sheets, get them some Cozy Earth pajamas or loungewear.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.840]   They will like it.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.080]   I can tell you this stuff is incredibly comfortable.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   It is worth it.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.320]   All right, so here's my gift to you this holiday season.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.920]   If you go to CozyEarth.com and enter the code CAL, you can save up to 40%.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:50.280]   That's CozyEarth.com and enter that code CAL to get up to 40% off CozyEarth.com.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.840]   I also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:03.920]   If you are looking to sell things online, Shopify is absolutely the platform you have
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   to use.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.520]   Whether you're in the launch your first online shop stage, your first real life store stage,
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.320]   all the way to the do we just hit a million order stage, Shopify is there to help you
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.840]   grow.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.760]   They turn browsers into buyers with the Internet's best converting checkout 36% better on average
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.200]   compared to other leading eCommerce platforms.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   You can sell more with less effort now thanks to Shopify magic, which introduces AI into
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.760]   helping you make that sale.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:40.400]   Shopify now powers 10% of all eCommerce in the U.S.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.000]   It's the global force behind Allbirds, Rothy's, and Brooklinen among millions of other entrepreneurs
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.880]   of every size across 175 countries.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:55.180]   Jesse, when we open up our long awaited online store, Shopify would absolutely be how we're
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.720]   going to handle our eCommerce orders.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.160]   It makes it so easy.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   It also connects.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.600]   So if a customer is used to Shopify, check out somewhere else, it remembers their information.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.720]   It makes it easy to buy.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.480]   The only thing holding us back is we don't yet have our great idea.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.820]   We know how to sell it, Shopify.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:17.940]   We don't yet have our great idea for what exactly we're going to put in our store.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.800]   We can add some of the items from my favorite things.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.840]   So my favorite thing will just be stuff we invent.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.760]   We invent the sell, but I look forward to it.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.520]   I look forward to coming up with cool things to sell.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   All right.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.520]   Here's what I can tell you.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.720]   Sign up now for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:46.000]   Just be sure to type that in all lowercase, go to shopify.com/deep now to grow your business
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.640]   no matter what stage you're in that's shopify.com/deep.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   All right.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.680]   So while I brainstorm ideas for our soon to come eCommerce store, let's get started with
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   questions.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.520]   What do we have today for questions?
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.800]   Hi, first questions from Mir.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.320]   You have said that four hours of deep work is the max per day.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.440]   Does reading count towards this limit?
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.320]   Well, two things here.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.660]   The four hour limit is approximate.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.040]   Where that actually comes is from studies of professional musicians, looking at how
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.120]   long they're able to practice in a typical day.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.480]   Professional music caliber practice being essentially an extreme form of deep work.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.760]   It's at the more extreme scale because it requires intense sustained concentration.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.000]   That's harder to use your brain harder than a professional musician trying to learn a
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   new piece.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.220]   So we use that as our upper limit.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:51.840]   The study I looked at found that the most common configuration of practicing for these
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.200]   professional musicians studied was a two hour session, a break, and then another two hour
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   session.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.160]   So I recommend if you're doing the hardest type of deep work, you know, don't expect
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.080]   to be able to do more than four hours.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.280]   There's huge variation here.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.660]   Some people are more comfortable doing more.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:11.460]   More commonly, however, is a lot of deep work is not as hard as what a professional musician
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.720]   does when they're practicing so that you can fit more in.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.960]   Computer programmers will often report they can go many, many hours in a row.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.440]   And that's because if you really zoom in on the actual cognitive activity, when someone
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.880]   is computer programming, there's periods in there where it's very intense concentration.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:32.400]   I'm trying to figure out new code from scratch, this sort of algorithmic logic to make this
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.720]   work, which is equally an intensity to learning a new professional music piece.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:41.120]   But then there's other parts where you're autopilot coding or you're looking up information.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.520]   How does this library work?
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.440]   So it's a lot of ups and downs.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.240]   So you see the programmer who works for 10 hours straight, there still may be only four
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.500]   hours total of super intense thinking in there.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.240]   So depending on what's going on with your deep work, you might be able to spend more
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   time.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   So what about reading?
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   How does this affect it?
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.960]   You know, it just affects, depends on how difficult the reading is.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:12.000]   So if you're a Talmudic scholar who is trying to understand a complicated piece of the Gemara,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.440]   that might be very difficult, similar to algorithmic thinking, similar to trying to learn a new
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.440]   piece of music.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.680]   And there's only so much of that you can do.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   On the other hand, if you're reading, as I am right now, as part of Thriller December,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   because of course in December I like to, among other things, read more thrillers, a Tom Clancy
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:38.160]   book written well after Tom Clancy's death about a stealth fighter crashing in Arizona
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.640]   and some spy thing happening in Eastern Europe, you're not taxing your brain that much.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.960]   So it just depends on the type of reading.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.640]   The more intense it is, the more it's going to sort of pull from that pool of deep work
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.640]   reserves.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   And the more fun it is, the more you can do.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.040]   I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.300]   I just think reading is a good leisure.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.600]   Your mind is more happy engaging in reading than consuming passively.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.240]   So keep reading as much as feels comfortable.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.800]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.000]   Next question is from SR.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.400]   I read and think a lot.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.320]   Consequently, I have a lot of notes on all sorts of subjects, but I still feel like my
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.440]   understanding of these ideas are scattered when I attempt to communicate them with others.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.560]   My presentation just seems haphazard and shallow.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   How should I fix this?
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.360]   Well, sorry, I like this question because we've already done the answer in the deep
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.680]   dive, which is idea documents.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.400]   So you might have noticed this among people who are more sort of traditionally intellectual
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.440]   or professional intellectuals.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.120]   They're very good at I read this New Yorker piece or watch this documentary and can now
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.720]   with great confidence sort of talk on this topic.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.440]   In fact, I can talk sort of I'm speaking from experience here, sort of like 60 percent out
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   of my butt on this.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.200]   But like I picked up enough things that I can sort of talk about this really confidently.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.800]   That's practice.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.160]   That's practice with taking information and integrating them into a structure, a conceptual
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.280]   structure that you can then apply to generate new information.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.880]   So in conversation, I can now use this conceptual structure when engaging on this topic and
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.560]   be able to pull from it and seem really smart.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.480]   How do you practice doing that is idea documents.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.200]   You create these documents around ideas you care about or think are interesting.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.760]   You begin to fill them out and evolve them.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.260]   The act of actually writing forces you to build conceptual structures because the writing
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:29.660]   is just a reflection of an internal abstract structure on the page.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.560]   If you write something structured about a topic you care about, I've written something
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.840]   structured about the conflict in the Middle East, how I'm feeling about it, where my confusions
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.900]   are, who I don't agree with, who I do agree with.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:44.440]   That requires you to build a conceptual structure for the information you have.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.300]   Now for a lot of people who are not professional thinkers, it really changes your experience
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.300]   of the world.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:54.040]   Because if you're not building conceptual structures in which you integrate information,
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.320]   what you're doing instead is just surfing vibes.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.960]   You know, I don't know, like, I don't, I don't like this person.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.440]   And that person seems to be on the other side of this thing.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:10.400]   So like, boo, or I don't know, I saw this thing, someone tweeted, and it made me feel
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   righteous at the time.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.800]   No, I didn't try to actually integrate this into a conceptual structure.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.320]   So I just sort of feel like it, this is a clear cut issue, right?
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   And like, we're just really right.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.160]   And then you get into a conversation and you try to repeat the thing you saw tweeted that
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.000]   in that form felt so righteous, and it's like, this doesn't really feel so convincing anymore.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.520]   And the other person just said three things I wasn't thinking about, I don't know what
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.520]   to do.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.360]   And your head sort of explodes, or you just, you know, you're on the other team.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   So we're not used to it.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.080]   Most people are not used to this way of actually engaging with the world.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.800]   This is how you practice.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   Idea documents.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.840]   So do this with actual topics that you talk to people about.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.480]   Do this also with topics that are completely timeless that you want to know more about.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.320]   If it's a technology, a type of philosophy.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.160]   I built out a pretty extensive document a few years ago when I was listening to one
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.560]   of the great courses on the great ideas of Western philosophy.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.200]   And I sort of start building this thing out.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.080]   Like, I don't know, let me just write this down.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.480]   And this person thought this, it just really helped me sort of structure who is who and
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.680]   what they were thinking and how this is important.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   When you don't write it down, it all sort of just filters through.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.080]   So SR, start doing those idea documents and you're going to get better and better at this.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.200]   All right.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   Let's keep rolling.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.080]   Next question is from Maggie.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.240]   I work in data analysis and I'm regularly bored in my day to day tasks.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.480]   At the same time, my side hustle has gotten to the point where I can spend the whole day
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.040]   in deep work without distraction.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.760]   What should I do in the interim to maintain my deep work muscle while also getting through
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   the day?
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:50.100]   So Jesse, if you've gotten used to this type of question, we get the, I call it the leading
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.360]   the witness question, right?
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:58.960]   Where it's like, well, my work is bad and it's really boring and it's stupid and, but
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.880]   this other thing is really great and it's awesome and I could do it all day long and
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.480]   I, it gives me meaning in life.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   What should I do?
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   It's a leading, leading the question.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   So I want you to be careful here.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.960]   This is Maggie.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.920]   I want you to be wary of Grasses Greener Syndrome.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.320]   So when you're just sort of going through your professional life with what in my book,
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.520]   so good, they can't ignore you, I call the passion mindset, which is what is this job
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.360]   offering me?
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.000]   You're very susceptible to the grasses greener syndrome, which is like, I don't love like
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.600]   what I'm doing day to day right now.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.960]   Maybe there's something where I would love what I'm doing day to day more.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.080]   And when you start messing around with side hustles, this gets even more dangerous because
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.800]   it is easy to create a quote unquote side hustle that just like lets you do the thing
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.960]   you think is fun in the moment, right?
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.880]   Because when you don't have to depend on that side hustle for all of your income, when you
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.760]   don't have to depend on that side hustle to actually create an impact in the world or
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.800]   support people, you can just make it whatever you want.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.840]   And then you tell yourself the story that like, there's jobs like this out here, I could
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.640]   just be doing this really fun thing.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.880]   But over here on this other world in this non data analysis, there's, you know, I have
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.280]   to fill out memos and it's not always like that.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.380]   My boss is kind of annoying and it's not always interesting what I'm doing.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.200]   But in my side hustle, I'm writing a novel and it's like fun, I'm just writing all day.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:27.000]   But the issue is that side hustle could just be you cosplaying some sort of imaginary ideal
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.560]   of what work could be.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.120]   It's a dangerous thing to have pulling you.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.180]   So how do we get out of this situation?
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.880]   It's not just we say, well, just grin and bear whatever your job is, because maybe your
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   job isn't in its current state what it should be.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.240]   The way you get out of this situation is lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.480]   I have an ideal vision of where I want my life to be, and here's my sort of target in
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.400]   the next few years, all the aspects of my life, where I live, what I do, what my days
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.560]   are like, my engagement with community and the rest of the world.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.720]   All these things are really clear.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.280]   And as part of this, you then look back and say, how does I use my working life to get
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.720]   me closer there?
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.080]   Then what you were doing in your working life is part of a intentional plan to get you closer
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.820]   to a more idealized version of your lifestyle.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.380]   That is much more effective than just the passion mindset of, do I like what I'm doing?
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.500]   Is there another thing I could be doing that I would like more?
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:21.140]   Maybe I should just be a novelist because this is fun.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:27.700]   Like Cal, I bought a hipster keyboard and it clickety clacks and I'm drinking coffee
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.140]   and clickety clacky.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.380]   Brad Stolberg, by the way, Jesse, called my new keyboard a hipster keyboard.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.380]   Oh, really?
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.380]   He's like, ah, so you got one of those hipster keyboards.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.140]   Does he see them a lot in coffee shops?
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.140]   I don't know.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.140]   I don't know.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.140]   I don't know.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.140]   I don't know about Asheville.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.140]   There's probably a lot of hipsters there, right?
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.140]   That's what I understand.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.140]   So he calls it a hipster keyboard, which it is.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.140]   So you're like, this is fun.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.420]   I clickety clack and wear a beret and a pipe in Starbucks, which is exactly what I do.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.900]   I'm just like, ha, ha, ha.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.900]   Right, right, right.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.780]   I don't think this is fun and data now, this is, the other stuff is kind of, you know,
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.780]   it's annoying, right?
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.880]   You're just going to get drawn into that.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:05.740]   But if you're like, no, no, no, this data analysis job is part of the money it generates,
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.760]   what I'm doing now, but where I want to shift my position here eventually as I get to this
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.780]   level, I'm going to shift this to a consultant because I've saved this much money, and then
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.620]   it's going to be six months on, six months off, which is going to allow us, like, you
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.020]   have this plan worked out that the work you're doing now and what you're working towards
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:25.020]   with your work is part of a plan that connects to deeply with what resonates.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.420]   That's where you want to be, not just analyzing this, your day-to-day activity, something
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.260]   you enjoy or not, and then inventing, you know, this ideal job cosplay, like, well,
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.940]   I'm comparing it to that.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.940]   You know, it couldn't be that.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:42.420]   It's the equivalent of, like, you're looking at your romantic partner and then you're watching
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.620]   a Ryan Reynolds movie and you're like, oh, Ryan Reynolds seems kind of better.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:52.260]   I mean, he's funny, he's, like, pretty good shape, you know, he's like the handyman in
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.980]   this small town in this Christmas movie that, like, I didn't realize would teach me the
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.780]   meaning of Christmas.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.180]   And then, you know, you look over at your romantic partner, like, oh, no, I mean, maybe
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180]   it's probably because of Ryan Reynolds.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.980]   It's kind of the same thing when you're, you know, cosplaying on your hipster keyboard,
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.780]   like, well, this is more fun than, you know, my job that's sending my kids to private school.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.500]   So I think working backwards, and I know I'm a broken record on this, but lifestyle-centered
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.460]   career planning gives you focus on what you're doing and why, which is what you need to keep
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.540]   moving.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.700]   Your motivational system needs an understanding of what you're doing and how it leads to something
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:32.180]   important, so that your episodic future thinking can see something that really resonates.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.180]   That's what it needs.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.380]   You don't need to enjoy every minute of what you're doing.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.240]   That's the wrong metric.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:43.660]   The athlete who really wants to be the best in their field does not enjoy all the time
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.020]   they spend in the weight room, but they're motivated to do it because it's part of their
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.420]   vision of being number one.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.460]   So that would be my advice there.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.980]   Be careful of Grass's Greener Syndrome.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.820]   All right, what's our next question, Jesse?
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.180]   - All right, this is the moment of truth, too.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.700]   - Is this Slow Productivity Corner?
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   - Yep.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   - All right, let's get some theme music.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:12.540]   All right, what is our Slow Productivity Corner question of the day, Jesse?
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.540]   - That came from Kiran.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   - Thank you, Kiran.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.900]   - I'm a slow thinker, but at times my employee wants complicated answers quickly.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:25.460]   I struggle at times to gather my thoughts into concise answers to appease management.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.460]   How should I compensate?
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:31.620]   - Okay, well, I'm gonna give you a couple ideas here.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.540]   One of them will be concrete, and one of them's gonna be a little bit more psychological.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.020]   Let me start with the concrete.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:44.420]   Lean into your slowness here by cultivating, this could be like a quirky idiosyncratic
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.420]   trait of yours.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:50.140]   When you get that email, "Hey, Dante, what about like whatever?"
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:55.020]   You say, "Interesting question, let me give this a thought.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.660]   I'll get back to you after lunch."
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.660]   You have a specific time.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.820]   That then gives you enough time to sit down and say, "Okay, let me take a break, let me
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:09.380]   take a beat, and let me think through like what do I really wanna say here?
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.100]   And let me gather some points here and actually make this pretty thoughtful and then send
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.380]   it back by the time I said I was gonna send it back."
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.900]   So then people think like, "Well, Dante, yeah, he's a very thoughtful guy.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.060]   He never responds right off the cuff in the meetings.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.020]   He says, 'Let me get back to you,' and then he does, and he gets back to us in the time
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.020]   he says."
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.120]   And it's always really thoughtful stuff.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.780]   And now you're leaning into the slowness, instead of losing opportunities, like, "Ah,
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.580]   like Dante doesn't get back to us," or it's incomplete.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.100]   They're like, "This is just the way this guy operates.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.540]   That's actually kind of cool.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.180]   He's careful, so we can kind of trust him on careful stuff.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.540]   And here's the bonus, Dante, they will maybe start leaving you out of this sort of knucklehead
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.460]   like back and forth hyperactive hive mind, like, "Let's just go back and forth 70 emails
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.140]   right now and try to like get some answer."
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:59.300]   You don't really wanna be a part of that anyways, like, "I'm slower, so no, I can't do the less
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.300]   than 70 emails next 30 minutes, but I can really help think what's really gonna be best
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   for this client."
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.100]   To do this, you really have to deliver, though.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.060]   Really do think through and be deliberate.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.360]   Here's my psychological answer.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.200]   So that's like what you could do positively.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.700]   There could be a negative aspect here as well.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.980]   There could be some combination of perfectionism and imposter syndrome self-confidence issues
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.100]   going on here, right?
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.260]   So the other thing that might be happening is you're just worried about shooting off
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:30.020]   a response because you worry, "I'm insufficient.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.660]   This might not be smart.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.360]   This might not make sense.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:37.060]   If I send off this response too quick and I really haven't thought about it, the boss
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.540]   is gonna be like, 'Aha, I knew it.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   You're not smart.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.860]   You're an imposter.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.260]   Pack up and get out of here.'"
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:51.320]   And so you're crippled by this idea of, "Do I really belong here?
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   Are people gonna think I'm dumb?"
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.060]   It's sort of like a perfectionism imposter syndrome.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.640]   That's also very common in these sort of work scenarios.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.660]   And there you have to just basically, this is psychological, you have to harness your
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:07.860]   sort of inner American white maleness of just, "I will be very confident."
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.500]   Like, "Yeah, I know about this.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.500]   There."
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.500]   You know?
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.500]   And just be like, "It'll work out."
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.900]   You gotta have to kind of get that mindset a little bit.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.620]   It's gonna feel artificial at first.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.460]   It's sort of like, "Yeah, of course.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.460]   Do this.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.460]   Of course."
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.460]   You know?
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.980]   And then high-five people because that's what American white males do, I suppose.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:26.980]   We high-five each other.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.980]   They type on hipster keyboard.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:33.260]   We're just like, "Let me just knock this out on my hipster keyboard.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.260]   Give it up."
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.580]   Just round of high-fives.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.580]   Everyone in the room is just high-fiving.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.500]   So you got some of that's just mindset.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.340]   People, here's the thing, people are not scouring over your responses.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.500]   They're not looking at them in detail.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:50.060]   There's not a committee that's like, "Okay, here comes Dante.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   Let's put it up.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.700]   Project it.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.700]   Project it on the board."
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.300]   For some reason, they have it on a 1980s-style plastic film on the overhead projector, and
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.420]   they're all staring at it and thinking about it.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.020]   And then finally, someone in a tweed jacket shakes their head and says, "No, this is not
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.280]   good.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.180]   This is not good at all."
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.740]   And then the other guy is like, "So we're gonna murder him?"
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.740]   Like, "Yeah, let's do it."
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.100]   And they all just run out of the room to come get you.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.180]   That's not what happens when you send a quick email.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.700]   It's mainly just people who are really busy and overwhelmed and just trying to throw things.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.180]   I need an answer to this because I have so many things going on.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.180]   I'm super stressed.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.800]   They don't really care.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:28.420]   If you read most people's emails in the hyperactive hive mind situation, they often sound like
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:33.420]   you have a caveman who's dealing with a brain injury responding.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:39.740]   You know, it's like, "Me, client meeting, bad, 4 p.m., question mark, emoji," right?
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.420]   People are just throwing junk around.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.380]   So the psychological answer is, like, you go a little easier on yourself.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.580]   Just be like, "Yeah, it's fine.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.660]   They're not people.
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.260]   Just the conversation needs to move forward."
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.740]   So you have some combination of these two options.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:57.580]   Don't be so worried about people scrutinizing your responses, or, and this could be complimentary,
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.580]   lean into being a slow thinker.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.580]   "This is my thing.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.340]   I take my time."
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.740]   But then I give you good responses.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:09.420]   I like this second, this latter response just because I think it might free you from a lot
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.780]   of the back-and-forth hyperactive nonsense and in a way that's not costing you.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.580]   We don't involve Dante in, like, a lot, some of the back-and-forth nonsense because, not
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.940]   because he's not reliable, but because he's a slower, more careful thinker.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.060]   So he probably won't respond to this right away.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.500]   In fact, the fact that you are, you will respond to this right away makes me think, "Why aren't
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.500]   you more like Dante?"
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.700]   So it's like a positive way to actually get away from some knucklehead stuff.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.260]   So anyways, good question, Dante.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.140]   That was our slow productivity corner.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.980]   Should we hit the music again, Jesse?
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980]   All right.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.980]   Let's do it.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.980]   Just feel calmer.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.980]   Do we have a call?
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:47.980]   Let's do a call.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:48.980]   We got a call.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.980]   All right.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.980]   Let's get someone on the phone.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.980]   Who do we got here?
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   Here we go.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980]   Hey, Cal.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:54.980]   Andy here.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:55.980]   Thank you very much for your wonderful podcast.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:12.540]   I've been enjoying going deep and dropping that into every sentence I use.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.000]   So question for you today is quite simple.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.300]   How do you take deep holiday?
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.580]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:25.420]   Well, first of all, Andy makes me think we should have added a sixth practice to our
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.380]   deep dive about how to become a more serious thinker.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.020]   And that practice is adopt an English accent.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:35.300]   I think people just give you, what, 50% more intellectual seriousness?
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.300]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.380]   I was hoping you'd use your French accent.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.820]   Well, that's not an intellect.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.100]   I think the English accent sounds smarter.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.740]   I've got a fantastic English accent.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:50.660]   Holiday, right, chop?
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.340]   No, it's Russian.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.740]   English accents make everything sound smarter.
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:54:01.300]   Deep holidays is a good question, especially if, you know, you do think for a living like
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.300]   I do.
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.420]   I had to figure this out.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:12.100]   I used to think the goal for a vacation was to have nothing to do, because you get overwhelmed
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:17.540]   by having too much to do as you approach the vacations, you say, wouldn't this be great
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.700]   to have nothing to do?
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.520]   Just it's me and my family and some fun books.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.060]   It would stress the hell out of me, right?
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:32.300]   It's like you're a serious drinker and you say for the next two weeks, you know, I'm
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.620]   not going to touch it.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:37.140]   It's difficult for those two weeks because you've been doing it all the time.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:43.780]   So I would have a huge difficulty on vacations, especially when we had young kids, just feeling
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:50.500]   uncomfortable and antsy and bored and weird because my brain was like, what are we doing
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   here?
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:57.620]   So what I learned to do was to bring things to think deeply about on vacation.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.220]   This will not cause stress.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:04.500]   Just make sure these things are fully disconnected from any sort of communication or back and
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:08.460]   forth to make sure they can't generate new tasks that you have to deal with and schedule
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.940]   that really what you want escape from is all of that cognitive context, shifting all of
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.380]   that, dealing with ever evolving collections of obligations and scheduling.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.700]   That's what you need to escape from.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.700]   But actually the thinking hard about something interesting piece, well, that's actually the
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.780]   fun part of work.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.660]   And so to be able to just do some of that, you know, I go for, I used to do this when
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.180]   we'd go to the beach, go for a walk on the beach every day and just think about something
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.180]   and take notes.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.020]   You don't need that much, but that's great.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.260]   You know, planning is a good thing to do on vacations.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:43.060]   I want to just like think through, like, what do I want to do with like this new book?
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.220]   So many of my book ideas have come together.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.540]   The final stage of coming together has happened on vacation.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:53.180]   So having things to think through that are allow slowness, you can just spend time with
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   them.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   There's no time sensitivity.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.180]   No one's waiting for you.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.100]   That generates no new obligations, no back and forth communication.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.380]   To me, that's a deep holiday.
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.460]   You don't want to escape work.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:06.500]   You want to just keep the coolest, most fun intellectual parts of work.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.980]   Those then are the, those then are the best trips.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.980]   All right.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.840]   So I want to end the second segment here with a case study.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.460]   This is where one of your listeners sends in a case study about putting my ideas into
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.660]   practice in your real life.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:25.200]   Today's case study comes from Misha, who says, I read digital minimalism and immediately
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.300]   started an electronic detox.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:32.820]   I do not have social media before, but I used to watch YouTube in particular Korean video
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:38.180]   logs, Netflix and Disney plus while cooking, cleaning, and sometimes for leisure, I used
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.140]   to complain that I had no time at all.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.780]   I was struggling to get things done at work.
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.740]   I was not able to focus on finishing my data science certification bootcamp.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.340]   I was not able to spend quality time with my 12 year old son, and I was not getting
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.340]   enough sleep.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.140]   When I started the 30 day detox, I noticed that I was able to focus more.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:00.700]   I enjoyed spending time with myself and my thoughts.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.700]   I was able to read and replicate some machine learning papers.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.100]   And most of all, I was fully aware of the present and improving my relationship with
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.740]   my son.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.780]   Setting aside distractions such as YouTube and streaming services gave me my thoughts
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.780]   back.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.980]   I always enjoyed silence, but I lost that after getting addicted to streaming services.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:21.180]   I can now think in peace.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.780]   At the end of the 30 days, I was able to finish my data science certification.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.100]   I'm currently sleeping eight to nine hours every night.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.180]   I spend much more quality time with my son.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:33.180]   I was able to read four books and my brain is not hungry for dopamine anymore.
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.740]   I mean, sometimes I want to just lay down and binge on something.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.640]   So I always have my Kindle with me.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:41.900]   When I feel this way, I purchase a thriller, mystery, or a fantasy and fiction book that
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.900]   I get to read.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.420]   I rediscovered the pleasure of reading.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.580]   I also renewed my library card.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.100]   I guess being connected all the time is not just a waste of time, but it shallows the
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:54.220]   brain and you feel like you've lost the power to work on deep issues, learn hard things,
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.780]   and get back to thinking.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.540]   Misha, I enjoy that case study.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:03.820]   This is essentially practice number one from our deep dive earlier in the show.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:08.700]   Consume higher quality information and consume much less of it.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.660]   So when you cut a lot of these sources of information from your life, especially those
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:17.800]   that are just designed around an engagement model, it's a different intellectual world.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   Everything is slower.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.420]   You can spend time with your thoughts.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.500]   You have a lot more time than you thought.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.500]   Everything gets better.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.580]   You're more present.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:31.880]   There's just a slowness to not being caught up into this net of optimized, algorithmically
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.840]   curated information that the slow down and get appreciation out of subtle understanding
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:42.540]   material and not just as like emotional in the moment raw feelings really is a nicer
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.100]   way to live.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.500]   The only correction or addition I would give to this is I don't typically use the word
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   detox.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.620]   I use the word declutter, right?
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:56.940]   So the idea is not I'm just going to stop using all these things temporarily to get
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:57.940]   away from them.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:02.000]   It is instead I'm going to stop using all these things so I can rediscover life without
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.880]   them and then very carefully decide what comes back or not.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.360]   Declutter the proverbial closet here.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.020]   So what you've done here was not a detox, but a declutter.
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:14.280]   You stepped away from everything and now you could decide what do I really need in my life
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   or not?
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.240]   You have cleaned up your digital life.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:22.400]   The detox terminology is too often abused in the digital community to talk about breaks.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.640]   I'm not a big fan of breaks for the sake of breaks.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.840]   I'm a fan of making permanent changes.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.200]   So the declutter concept is better.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:35.000]   You don't detox your closet by I empty out my closet for 30 days and put everything back
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.040]   in.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.360]   You declutter your closet by taking everything out and only putting back in what you really
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.360]   need.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:45.560]   So a great example, Misha, I think people underestimate how much positivity in their
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:51.800]   life is waiting on the other side of a more minimalistic approach to the digital.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.960]   All right, so I want to get to our final segment.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.420]   Before we do, Jesse, let's hear from some more sponsors.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:03.640]   I want to talk in particular about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:09.680]   Why don't you give yourself the gift of insane savings this holiday season with Mint Mobile's
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.760]   best wireless deal of the year.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.320]   Right now when you switch to Mint Mobile and buy any three month plan, you'll get another
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.760]   three months for free.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:24.320]   That is six months of premium wireless service for the price of only three.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.080]   Remember Mint Mobile lets you order and activate from home while saving tons of money on phone
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.080]   plans.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.280]   They have plans that start at just $15 a month.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.720]   Imagine turning an overpriced wireless bill into one that costs you just $15 a month by
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.420]   using Mint Mobile.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.820]   This is Mint Mobile's best offer of the year.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:51.320]   This is a limited time offer to get not just their standard high quality, low cost plan,
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.600]   but to get three months free of this plan.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.960]   You really, if you're thinking about switching to a much more affordable wireless plan, now
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.520]   is the time to do it because you can get those three months free.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.080]   Remember, the reason why these plans are cheaper is because Mint Mobile is online only.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:13.080]   They get rid of the overhead of all of the expensive in-person stores and elaborate on-TV
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   ads.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.280]   They pass those savings on to you.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.400]   They're using the nation's largest 5G networks.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:25.600]   You're getting high speed, unlimited text and high speed data from a very reliable network.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:30.240]   They just got rid of all the overhead that makes these other plans more expensive.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:37.320]   You can use your own existing phone with Mint Mobile because of eSIM technology.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.120]   Or if you need a new device, you can get six months of free service when you buy that device.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.460]   There's so many ways right now they're incentivizing.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.960]   If you want to switch to a more affordable wireless plan, you do it right now.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.760]   So for a limited time, buy any three-month Mint Mobile plan and get three months free
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.880]   by going to mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.880]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.120]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:09.420]   I also want to talk about our friends at My Body Tutor, a company founded by my longtime
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.320]   friend Adam Gilbert.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:19.040]   My Body Tutor is a 100% online coaching problem that helps you get healthier.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.160]   You have a coach who is assigned to you that helps you figure out what you're doing with
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.440]   your diet, what you're doing with your exercise, tailored to you.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.160]   And then you check in with this coach digitally every day.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.400]   So you're getting tailored plans plus accountability, knowing the coach is going to see what you
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.820]   did every day gets you to actually stick with the plan.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.080]   More importantly, they can also help you adjust as needed.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.480]   "Hey, it's the holidays.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.780]   What do I do this week?
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:46.880]   What should I keep in mind?
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.960]   Help me get through this.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.120]   Like coach, how do we adapt this?
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   I'm going to be on the road.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120]   I don't have my gym."
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.280]   They're there to help you adapt.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.240]   Because it's online, it doesn't cost you nearly as much as having a real trainer in your house,
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.960]   but you get the same benefits of tailored information and accountability.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.600]   I'm going to suggest don't wait until the new year.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.020]   Just start your initiative to get healthier.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.020]   Start it right now.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:15.900]   So that as you go into the holidays, the new year, you're already on that trajectory.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.520]   So you don't just blow it out over Christmas and be like, "Oh my God, now I really got
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.600]   to get in shape."
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Start it now.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   Get your momentum going.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:29.160]   And all you have to do to start to shift to a much healthier life is go to MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.640]   That's T-U-T-O-R, MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.840]   Go sign up.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.320]   Do it right now before we even get to the holidays.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.060]   If you mention deep questions when you sign up, Adam will give you $50 off your first
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.060]   month.
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.060]   That's at MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:54.140]   Let's go to our final segment where I react to things that are happening in the news.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:04:02.140]   I want to start this segment actually by reacting to something that a listener sent us.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.600]   So let me load this up over here.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:14.320]   So long-time fans of the show know that we have this long-running joke where I pretend
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.240]   that the Patrick Rufus book, "Name of the Wind" was written by Brandon Sanderson.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   Jesse, I got a very concerned email recently from a listener that was like, "Look, I feel
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   bad about this.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.080]   I love the show, but it's really, really bothering me.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.760]   I think you have the wrong author.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.000]   Brandon Sanderson did not write 'Name of the Wind.'"
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.520]   So this bit has been going on long enough that we have like a huge amount of our audience
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.400]   that just thinks I'm dumb, which I sort of appreciate.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:43.520]   Anyways, what's on the screen here, if you're watching instead of listening, one of our
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.520]   listeners, do we have their name somewhere?
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.960]   Yeah, it's, I'll get it.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.880]   Alaska or something like that, mocked up a fake version of "Name of the Wind."
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.880]   Lazdi.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.880]   Lazdi.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880]   Lazdi.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.640]   So on the screen here is a fake version of "The Name of the Wind" with Brandon Sanderson
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.320]   as the author.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:09.080]   There seems to be a wizard, a lizard in some sort of medieval armor holding, I guess, a
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   time block plan.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080]   So good.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   I appreciate it.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080]   I appreciate it.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.920]   I'm going to have to print that out.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.080]   We'll put that in the studio.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   So there we go.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.120]   It's the little things to make me happy.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.560]   But I have an actual article here to react to.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.400]   Load this up on the screen right now.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:31.640]   This appeared in Nature on November 29th.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.800]   So if you're watching, I have it up on the screen here.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.000]   Let's see here.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.560]   You know, I'm looking at this, Jesse, this is actually, this is not the full article.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.880]   This is actually the description of the data tables that got pulled into here.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   Oh, okay.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.120]   But I can tell you what's in, I can tell you what's actually in this article.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:06:01.560]   So the title of the article is Remote Collaboration Fuses Fewer Breakthrough Ideas.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:08.080]   Now, this was a study that was published in Nature where they took tens of thousands of
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:13.960]   actual research articles and patent applications, and they did some sort of analysis to figure
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:20.440]   out the nature of the work that was done to produce this intellectual artifact, in particular
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.720]   in person or over a long-distance collaboration.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:31.380]   And what they found was a strong connection between the original new ideas and working
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.500]   in person together.
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:40.720]   That these more long-distance collaborations were not as associated with as many new ideas.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.040]   So I wanted to get into this a little bit because I have talked about various forces
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.840]   that could help explain what they were seeing here.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:52.400]   You see, what's going on when we think about the world of creativity and production is
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.200]   we're really excited about ideas like network theory and recombinant growth models, where
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.760]   we just imagine there's just pools of information out there, and different people have different
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.000]   pools of information.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.800]   And if we just connect people, their pools of information connect, and we can have the
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.160]   information share with each other, and we get these interesting new combinations, and
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.000]   there comes innovation.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.840]   The networking itself is abstract to these models, it's just connect.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.040]   So it's online, it's digital, whatever, it doesn't really matter.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.240]   But this study here in nature is saying, "Well, actually, it does matter how you're actually
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.840]   bringing people together to work."
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.240]   And it's because we are missing from these abstract models something that's much more
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.240]   messy and concrete, which is actual human brain cognition.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.960]   Real human brains, messy collections of neurons that are actually trying to concentrate and
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:49.200]   create new thoughts, new important thoughts do not form from the low-friction recombination
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.680]   of abstract information.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:57.400]   They're produced in brains, and it requires serious thinking by real people.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:02.080]   It's a hard alchemical process that takes some information and produces new information
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.080]   that's valuable.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.020]   It is not just a recombination of ideas.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:13.500]   Working in person with other people supports that process much better than virtual collaboration.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   Now why is that?
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.300]   Well, there's an effect I wrote about in deep work called the whiteboard effect.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:24.640]   And what it said is, if you gather groups of people together to work on the same proverbial
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:31.700]   whiteboard on a problem for an extended period of time, that can actually unlock higher levels
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.460]   of cognition than people even just working on their own, because two things happen here.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.940]   One, there's the social pressure not to fall behind on the thread of thoughts.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.820]   So we're at the whiteboard, we're trying to figure out an equation.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:46.800]   People are going back and forth and sort of proposing their new additions.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.960]   If you let your attention wander, if you switch your cognitive context, there's a social cost,
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.620]   because now you're going to fall behind the thread of conversation.
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.740]   You're going to have to say at some point, "Hold on, guys.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:59.740]   Can you back up again?"
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   Right?
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.740]   You're going to let your mind wander.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:06.460]   So when multiple people are working on something hard concurrently, everyone is focusing longer
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.580]   and harder than they would than if it was just themselves.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.100]   So it's not much of a social cost if you let your mind wander by yourself.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.100]   No one knows.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.340]   And then you can kind of go back to it.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:19.660]   So when you're working together, one thing that happens is you think harder, you focus
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.700]   longer, you do less context shifts.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:26.740]   The second thing that happens is you get on-demand additions of new information.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.940]   I'm trying to figure out this proof.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.420]   I'm stuck right here.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.980]   This person right next to me might immediately be able to say, "Use this technique.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   I know this technique.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   You didn't.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:36.980]   I can get you unstuck."
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.740]   Then we get to another place where they're stuck, you have a technique that gets them
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.740]   unstuck.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:46.340]   So you expand your available pool of conceptual tools to apply to the problem at hand.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:53.580]   So people sitting together for hours focusing on something hard, they can actually produce
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:58.460]   more than just a single person thinking about it.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.040]   So what happens when we have remote collaboration?
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.740]   Most of that does not unlock those same whiteboard effects.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.500]   Remote collaboration, because I did a lot of this during COVID, it's emailing things
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:15.340]   back and forth, and it's having Zoom conferences for relatively short periods of time, because
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.540]   if it's Zoom, you've scheduled it on your calendar and it's an hour, and you're kind
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.540]   of talking things through.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.540]   And it's kind of useful.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.700]   You're exchanging some information, but you do not get those boost the cognition.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.980]   You do not get those in the moment when I'm stuck and actually thinking, you help me get
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   unstuck.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:33.220]   When you do remote collaboration, the actual acts of collaboration are typically disassociated
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.100]   from the serious thinking, the alchemy when you're trying to produce new thoughts.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.940]   You lose those advantages.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940]   I see this.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.420]   Let me give you an actual example from my own life as a professional thinker.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:49.700]   So last year with some collaborators, I published a computer science paper that won an award.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.420]   It won a best paper award.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.640]   Here's what's interesting about working on that paper.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.620]   Took a long time.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.420]   We were started during Zoom on Zoom because it's during the pandemic and my collaborators
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.740]   were all over the world.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.420]   We usually would get together every year, but we weren't.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:09.580]   And so we had these regular Zoom meetings for a long time.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.900]   We knew this was a good problem, weren't making progress.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.980]   Some progress would get made, but just getting stuck because on Zoom, we would talk about
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:20.980]   it and then maybe we'd think about it some on our own and not much was happening.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.420]   What got that paper unstuck?
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:30.940]   At some point I said, virus or no virus, those of you who are in this area, come to the Deep
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.860]   Org HQ.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.460]   We had the whiteboard in here.
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:37.460]   We spent the day, unlocked a lot of things.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.220]   Now suddenly we had a real core to this paper.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.180]   Around this time, Georgetown was back open again.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.180]   Thanks for rock and rolling.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:49.420]   So one of my collaborators who had been overseas as a Georgetown professor came back and we
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:55.020]   said, great, let's get together every, there's a day, it was a Wednesday, like we both taught
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:58.980]   on Wednesdays, between our classes, let's always get together and go to this whiteboard
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.980]   and just work.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.820]   And more things begin to unfold quicker now, quicker now.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.620]   And the core results of this paper really fell out to the place where then we could
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:09.140]   go back on our own and each take a different thing and polish it on our own.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.700]   Paper came together, won a best paper award.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:17.080]   So we couldn't make progress on this until we could figure out how to get back together.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.300]   Still took us two years because a lot of this was still done virtually.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.420]   Now I want to contrast that.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:28.460]   I'm going to load up something on the screen here, a cool thing that theoretical computer
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460]   scientists get to do.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.940]   So I've loaded on the screen a picture of this castle.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.180]   This is Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.420]   This is hard to get to.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.700]   You have to fly to Frankfurt and then take a train for a long time.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.660]   And then you get to the end of the line of the train, you have to have a car waiting
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.660]   to take you the rest of the way to this castle in the countryside.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:51.860]   This whole castle is dedicated to hosting workshops for computer scientists to get together
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:54.620]   for a week and do nothing but think about problems.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.660]   It's a really cool setup.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.560]   They give you assigned seating for all the meals.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.020]   So it rotates who you're with.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:05.780]   They have unlimited coffee and unlimited honor system beer.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.980]   You can't keep track of how much beer you drunk and like you kind of pay them at the
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.980]   end.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:10.980]   All day long, all you do.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.700]   You can't even walk anywhere from here.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.020]   You're stuck.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.980]   All day long, all you do is just talk to people in person about work.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.300]   You give informal presentations.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.300]   I went to these a long time, one of these a while back.
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.300]   It's a week.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.400]   You're a week in this castle.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.140]   More recently, I went back and tabulated how many papers came out of that week and it was
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.140]   six.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.420]   Six peer review publications came out of that one.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:39.240]   One week of just working all day in person with people unlocked the core results for
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.520]   six papers.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:44.040]   The paper that I just won that best paper award for, two years of effort.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.300]   Two years of effort, one paper versus one week, six papers.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:54.620]   There's something cognition enhancing to being in the same room with other smart people working
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.620]   on the same thing.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.920]   That is what I think they found or at least they were finding evidence of in that Nature
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.320]   paper.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.560]   The groups that were working together have a bigger brain.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.320]   It's a conceptual distributed combined cyborg brain.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.160]   They have a bigger brain to apply to the problem, cooler solutions come out.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.520]   We can't just think about, and this happens all the time, is we remove from the picture
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.780]   in lots of different areas when we think about technology intersecting our lives.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.740]   We remove from the picture this messy human brain that actually has to do cognition.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.800]   We try to reduce everything to just abstraction and it causes trouble.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.040]   When we think ideas are just recombining information, we're like, "Great.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.520]   It's just a global marketplace of ideas and we're just sharing stuff on Twitter and Zoom
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.760]   and we'll get all these great new ideas."
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   Not how it works.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.400]   Same thing happened in work.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.560]   We saw the world of work is just like people have information that they have to get to
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.720]   each other.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.680]   We adopted the hyperactive hive mind.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.080]   Let's just connect everybody up.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.800]   We're on Slack and email all day because all that matters is getting information to these
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.200]   abstract vessels of information that they need, not knowing or thinking about the fact
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.160]   that these messy collections of neurons between our ears can't keep switching back and forth
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.640]   between all these things.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.680]   That's not how thinking works.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.280]   It's not a network router.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.440]   It's something much messier.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.040]   We all got miserable and our productivity fell.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.480]   There's this, again, a cautionary tale that happens again and again when you deal with
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.240]   the intersection of technology and cultures.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.540]   Do not forget the human brain and how it actually operates.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.380]   It's weird and it's idiosyncratic, but it can also be wonderful.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.320]   But you need to actually work with the reality of how this organ functions if you want to
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   get the most out of it.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   I thought that was a cool example.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.240]   You can't just connect a lot of people with the internet and say, "We're going to have
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.120]   more ideas."
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.560]   Everything's more complicated than that, and a lot more messy and a lot more analog.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.480]   All right, Jesse, we should have a castle.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.480]   Why don't we have a castle?
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   >> A lot of space.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.080]   >> A lot of space.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.480]   That's our next goal.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:55.520]   We need a Schloss-Dagstuhl-style castle that we get together to figure out podcast ad reads.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.360]   I don't know what we're actually going to do at it.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   Brandon Sanderson jokes.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.680]   >> We're going to popularize our Shopify store.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.560]   That's where we're going to think what's going to go on that Shopify store.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.240]   Just imagine what we're going to produce.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.240]   All right, enough nonsense for now.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.900]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:13.260]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show, and until then, as always, stay
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.260]   deep.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:18.920]   >> Hey, so if you liked today's episode about how to become a more serious thinker, you
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:25.820]   should also check out episode 250, which is titled In Defense of Thinking, where I give
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:31.820]   a more thorough case for why deep contemplation is so important for living a deep life.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.820]   Check it out.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:39.420]   The deep question I want to tackle, why is it important to preserve the vanishing art
