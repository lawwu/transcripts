[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   All of your problems in your life are less likely to be money problems. I'm not saying you can't have
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.800]   money problems in level six or level five or level four, but when you're in level one, you could have
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.540]   other problems, but most of your problems are money problems. As you get to the higher wealth levels,
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.080]   all of your problems cannot be solved by money. And that is the big realization because you can't
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.340]   write, you can't like, oh, I've been working so much to build this wealth to sell this business
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.080]   on I'm worth $15 million. But as a result of that, I can't write my spouse a check to say,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.700]   hey, just, hey, just forget about all those years where I neglected you. Like we have money now. So
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.040]   let's all get along. That doesn't work. You can't do that with your children. You can't
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.480]   write your cardiovascular system. You can't ACH your cardiovascular system just to work better,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.220]   right? If you're not taking care of your health. So all the problems you're going to have in level
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.680]   five and level six are all the non-financial things. That's what's being amplified. There's
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.480]   all the non-financial pieces of your life.
