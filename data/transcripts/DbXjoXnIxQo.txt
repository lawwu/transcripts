[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   What are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.340]   How do you analyze it within your framework about war?
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.680]   - How far would they go to hang on to power
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.980]   when push came to shove is I think the thing
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.520]   that worries me the most and is plainly
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.120]   what worries most people about the risk of nuclear war.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.720]   Like at what point does that unchecked leadership
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.860]   decide that this is worth it?
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.700]   Especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.940]   (air whooshing)
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.380]   - The following is a conversation with Chris Blattman,
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380]   professor at the University of Chicago,
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.080]   studying the causes and consequences of violence and war.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.240]   This he explores in his new book called,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.900]   "Why We Fight, The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace."
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.220]   The book comes out on April 19th,
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.820]   so you should pre-order it to support Chris and his work.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.820]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.860]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.940]   in the description.
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.800]   And now, dear friends, here's Chris Blattman.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.540]   In your new book titled, "Why We Fight, The Roots of War
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.200]   and the Paths for Peace," you write, quote,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.740]   "Let me be clear what I mean when I say war.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.420]   I don't just mean countries duking it out.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.340]   I mean any kind of prolonged violence struggle
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.900]   between groups that includes villages, clans, gangs,
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.220]   ethnic groups, religious sects,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.620]   political factions and nations.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.840]   Wildly different as these may be,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.780]   their origins have much in common.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.540]   We'll see that the Northern Irish zealots,
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.380]   Colombian cartels, European tyrants,
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220]   Liberian rebels, Greek oligarchs, Chicago gangs,
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.100]   Indian mobs, Rwandan genocide dares,"
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.300]   a new word I learned, thank you to you.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.360]   Those are people who administer genocide.
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.940]   English soccer hooligans and American invaders.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.860]   So first, let me ask, what is war?
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.540]   In saying that war is a prolonged violence struggle
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.380]   between groups, what do the words prolonged,
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.580]   groups and violent mean?
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.500]   - I sit at the sort of intersection of economics
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.820]   and political science and I also dwell a little bit
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.720]   in psychology, but that's partly because I'm married
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.660]   to a psychologist, sometimes do research with her.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.700]   All these things are really different.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.660]   So if you're a political scientist,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.380]   you spend a lot of time just classifying
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.580]   a really narrow kind of conflict and studying that.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.140]   And that's an important way to make progress
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.180]   as a social scientist.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.460]   But I'm not trying to make progress,
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.580]   I'm trying to sort of help everybody step back
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.860]   and say, you know what, there's like some common things
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.660]   that we know from these disciplines
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.300]   that relate to a really wide range of phenomena.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.700]   Basically, we can talk about them in a very similar way
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.900]   and we can get really similar insights.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.340]   So I wanted to actually bring them together,
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.820]   but I still had to like say,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.580]   let's hold out individual violence,
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.180]   which has a lot in common, but individuals choose
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.440]   to engage in violence for more
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.700]   and sometimes different reasons.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.540]   So let's just put that aside so that we can focus a bit.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.780]   And let's really put aside short incidents of violence
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.480]   because those might have the same kind
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.860]   of things explaining them, but actually there's a lot
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.700]   of other things that can explain short violence.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.020]   Short violence can be really demonstrative.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.980]   Like you can just, I can use it to communicate information.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.580]   The thing that all of it has in common
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.360]   is that it doesn't generally make sense.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.020]   It's not your best option most of the time.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.580]   And so I wanted to say, let's take this thing
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.900]   that should be puzzling.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.540]   We kind of think it's normal.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.260]   We kind of think this is what all humans do,
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260]   but let's point out that it's not normal
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.420]   and then figure out why and let's talk about why.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.020]   And so that's, so I was trying to throw out
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.180]   the short violence, I was trying to throw out
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.180]   the individual violence.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.580]   I was also trying to throw out all the competition
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.060]   that happens that's not violent.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.500]   That's the normal, normal competition.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.460]   I was trying to say, let's talk about violent competition
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.900]   'cause that's kind of the puzzle.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.940]   - So that's really interesting.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.260]   So you said, usually people try to find
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.900]   a narrow definition and you said progress.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.780]   So you make progress by finding a narrow definition,
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.540]   for example, of military conflict in a particular context
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.940]   and progress means, all right, well,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.420]   how do we prevent this particular kind of military conflict
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.260]   or maybe if it's already happening,
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.900]   how do we deescalate it and how do we solve it?
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.700]   So from a geopolitics perspective,
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.580]   from an economics perspective,
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.300]   and you're looking for a definition of war
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.540]   that is as broad as possible, but not so broad
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.700]   that you cannot achieve a deep level of understanding
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.780]   of why it happens and how it can be avoided.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.500]   - Right, and a common, basically like recognize
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.940]   that common principles govern some kinds of behavior
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.500]   that look pretty different.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.340]   Like an Indian ethnic riot is obviously pretty different
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.580]   than invading a neighboring country, right?
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.580]   But, and that's pretty different than two villages
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.420]   or two gangs.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.700]   A lot of what I work on is studying organized criminals
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.020]   and gangs, two gangs going to where you'd think
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.900]   is really different and of course it is,
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.420]   but there are some like common principles.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.380]   You can just think about conflict and the use of violence
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.700]   and not learn everything, but just get a lot,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.700]   just get really, really far by sort of seeing
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.460]   the commonalities rather than just focusing
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.380]   on the differences.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.700]   - So again, those words are prolonged, groups, and violent.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.020]   Can you maybe linger on each of those words?
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.660]   What does prolonged mean?
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.220]   Where's the line between short and long?
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.100]   What does groups mean and what does violent mean?
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.640]   - So let me, you know, I have a friend who,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.340]   someone who's become a friend through the process
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.220]   of my work and writing this book also,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.220]   who was 20, 30 years ago was a gang leader in Chicago.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.580]   So this guy named Napoleon English or Nap.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.340]   And I remember one time he was saying,
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.460]   well, you know, when I was young, I used to,
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.980]   I was 15, 16 and he'd go to the neighboring gangs territory.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.140]   He says, I'd go gang banging.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.580]   And I said, well, I didn't know what that meant.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.540]   I said, what does that mean?
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.820]   And he said, oh, that just meant I'd shoot him up.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.420]   Like I'd shoot at buildings, I might shoot at people.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.340]   I wasn't trying to kill, he wasn't trying to kill them.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.020]   He was just trying to sort of send a signal
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.780]   that he was a tough guy and he was fearless
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.740]   and he was someone who they should be careful with.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.300]   And so I didn't want to call that war, right?
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.780]   That was, that was, that's something different.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.180]   That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.260]   And he wasn't, and he was basically trying
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.540]   to send them information.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.180]   And this is what countries do all the time, right?
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.180]   We have military parades and we might have border skirmishes.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.420]   And I wanted to sort of, so is it, what's short?
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.260]   Is it three month border skirmish, a war?
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.820]   I mean, I don't try to get into those things.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.260]   I don't want to, but I want to point out that like
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.020]   these long grueling months and years of violence
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.780]   are like part of the problem and the puzzle.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.340]   And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.300]   talking about the international version of gangbanging.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.500]   It's a different phenomenon.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.580]   - So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap,
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.300]   let's call him, not to add confusion,
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.860]   that doesn't qualify for war?
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.920]   Is it the individual aspect?
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.620]   Is it that violence is not the thing that is sought
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.620]   but the communication of information is what is sought?
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.740]   Or is it the shortness of it?
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.300]   Is it all of those combined?
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.860]   - It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.540]   or he was becoming the head of a group at that point.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.460]   And that group eventually did go to war
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.300]   with those neighboring gangs, which is to say
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.020]   it was just long drawn out conflict
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.900]   over months and months and months.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.460]   But I think one of the big insights from my fields
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.940]   is that you're constantly negotiating over something, right?
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.420]   Whether you're officially negotiating
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.340]   or you're all posturing,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.820]   like you're bargaining over something
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.340]   and you should be able to figure out a way
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.820]   to split that pie.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.580]   And you could use violence,
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.140]   but violence is, everybody's miserable.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.260]   Like if you're nap, like if you start a war,
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.000]   one, there's lots of risks.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.620]   You could get killed, that's not good.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.100]   You could kill somebody else and go to jail,
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.600]   which is what happened to him, that's not good.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.620]   Your soldiers get killed.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.180]   No one's buying your drugs in the middle of a gunfight
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.180]   so it interrupts your business.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.940]   And so on and on, it's like, it's really miserable.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.900]   This is what we're seeing right now.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.860]   As we're recording, the Russian invasion of Ukraine
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.060]   is now in its fourth or fifth week.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.940]   Everybody's, if it didn't dawn on them before,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.180]   it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.420]   - As you described, for everybody.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.700]   So everybody is losing in this war.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.220]   - Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.100]   Everybody loses something from war.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.940]   And there was usually, not always,
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.280]   but the point is there was usually a way
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.200]   to get what you wanted or be better off
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.880]   without having to fight over it.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.140]   So there's this, it's just,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.980]   fighting is just politics by other means.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.660]   And it's just inefficient, costly, brutal,
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.540]   devastating means.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.020]   And so that's like the deep insight.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.580]   And so I kind of wanted to say,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.940]   so I guess, like, what's not war?
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.860]   I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.900]   'cause some, you know, there's reams and reams
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.060]   of political science papers written on like,
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.820]   what's a war, what's not a war?
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.780]   People disagree.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.340]   I just wanted to say,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.100]   war is the thing that we shouldn't be doing.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.000]   Or war is the violence that doesn't make sense.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.460]   There's a whole bunch of other violence,
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.940]   including gangbanging and skirmishes
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.040]   and things that might make sense,
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.680]   precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.760]   or they're not particularly costly.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.260]   War is the thing that's just so costly
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.140]   we should be trying to avoid
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.340]   is maybe like the meta way I think about it.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.720]   - Right, nevertheless, definitions are interesting.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.440]   So outside of the academic bickering,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   every time you try to define something,
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.120]   So the destination doesn't matter
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.560]   'cause the moment you arrive at the definition,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.720]   you lose the power.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.800]   - Yeah, one of the interesting things,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.960]   I mean, so people, you know, if you wanna do,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.880]   you know, some of what I do
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   is just quantitative analysis of conflict.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.080]   And if you wanna do that,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.240]   if you wanna sort of run statistics on war,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.640]   then you have to code it all up.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.320]   And then lots of people have done that.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.440]   There's four or five major datasets
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.400]   where people or teams of people have over time said,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.880]   we're gonna code years of war
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.960]   between these groups or within a country.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.320]   And what's interesting is how difficult,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.120]   these datasets don't often agree.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.600]   You have to make all of these,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.840]   the decision gets really complicated.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.680]   Like when does the war begin, right?
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.440]   Does it begin when a certain number
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.040]   of people have been killed?
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.960]   Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.800]   and sort of little terror attacks
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.840]   or a couple bombs lobbed,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.120]   and then eventually turns into war,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.800]   do we call that, do we backdate it
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.480]   to like when the first act of violence started?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.300]   And then what do we do with all the times
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.320]   when there was like that low scale,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.840]   low intensity violence or bombs lobbed?
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.160]   And do we call those wars,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.280]   but only or maybe only if they eventually get worse?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.840]   Like, so you get, it actually is really tricky.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.680]   - And the defensive and the offensive aspect.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.800]   So everybody, Hitler in World War II,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.920]   it seems like he never attacked anybody.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.600]   He's always defending against the unjust attack
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.240]   of everybody else as he's taken over the world.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.480]   So that's like information propaganda
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.040]   that every side is trying to communicate to the world.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.640]   So you can't listen to necessarily information
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.240]   like self-report data.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.040]   You have to kind of look past that somehow,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.160]   maybe look, especially in the modern world,
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.880]   as much as possible at the data.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.320]   How many bombs dropped?
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.260]   How many people killed?
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.200]   How the number of, the estimates of the number of troops
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.120]   moved from one location to another and that kind of thing.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.400]   And the other interesting thing
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.920]   is there's a quantitative analysis of war.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.240]   So for example, I was looking at just war index
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.040]   or people trying to measure,
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.840]   trying to put a number on what wars are seen as just and not.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.360]   - Oh really, I've never seen that.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.680]   - It's, there's numbers behind it.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.520]   It's great.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.800]   So it's great because again,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   as you do an extensive quantification of justice,
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.680]   you start to think what actually contributes to our thought
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.580]   that for example, World War II is a just war
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.980]   and other wars are not.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.720]   A lot of it is about intent
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.200]   and some of the other factors that you look at,
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.800]   which is prolonged, the degree of violence
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.160]   that is necessary versus not necessary,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   given the greater good,
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.200]   some measure of the greater good of people,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.080]   all those kinds of things.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.600]   Then there's reasons for war,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   looking to free people or to stop a genocide
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.240]   versus conquering land, all those kinds of things.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.320]   And people try to put a number behind it.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.600]   And a lot of-- - And it's based on,
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.040]   I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.160]   I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.460]   suppose I think my God tells me to do something
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.960]   or my God thinks that, or my moral sense thinks
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.760]   that something that another group is doing is repugnant.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.720]   I'm curious, like are they evaluating
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.880]   like the validity of that claim
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.120]   or just the idea that like,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.320]   well, you said it was repugnant,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   you deeply believe that, therefore it's just?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.040]   - I think, now it could be corrected on a lot of this,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.520]   but I think this is always looking at wars
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.160]   after they happened.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.840]   So it's, and trying to take a global perspective
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.640]   from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.480]   So you're not weighing disproportionately
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.680]   the opinions of the people who waged the war.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   because, I mean, one is to just point out that wars,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.860]   actually most wars aren't necessary.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.560]   And so in the sense that there's another way
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.400]   to get what you wanted.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.560]   And so on one level, there's no just war.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.720]   Now that's not true because take an example
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.960]   like the US invasion of Afghanistan,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.760]   the United States has been attacked.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.240]   There's a culpable agent, reliable evidence
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.000]   that this is Al-Qaeda, they're being sheltered
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.280]   in Afghanistan by the Taliban.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.520]   And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.440]   It seems that there was an attempt to say,
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.160]   hand him over or else, and they said, no way.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.840]   Now you can make an argument that invading
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.380]   and attacking is strategically the right thing to do
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.660]   in terms of sending signals to your future enemies.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.400]   Or you just, if you think it's important
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.960]   to bring someone to justice, in this case, Al-Qaeda,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.040]   then maybe that's just war or that's a just invasion.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.740]   But it hinges on the fact that the other side
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.640]   just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing,
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.920]   which is say, okay, we'll give him up.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   And so it was completely avoidable in one sense.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.080]   But if you believe, and I think it's probably true,
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.480]   if you believe that for their own ideological
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.080]   and other reasons, Mullah Omar in particular
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.600]   and Taliban in general decided we're not going to do this,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.560]   then now you're not left with very many good choices.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.480]   And now, I didn't want to talk about is that a just war,
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.160]   is that, what's justice or not?
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.280]   I just wanted to point out that like,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.160]   one side's intransigence, if that's indeed what happened,
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.620]   one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.080]   to basically eliminates all of the reasonable bargains
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.440]   that you could be satisfied with.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.520]   And now you're left with really no other strategic option
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.600]   but to invade.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.300]   I think that's a slight oversimplification,
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.520]   but I think that's like one way to describe what happened.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.720]   - So your book is fascinating,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.360]   your perspective on this is fascinating.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.000]   I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.880]   to try to get a clarity.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.760]   But the thesis is that war is costly,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.260]   usually costly for everybody.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.860]   So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war,
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.480]   because you're going to,
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   from a game theoretic perspective, nobody wins.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason,
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.600]   or healthy operation of the world, some kind of breakdown.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.700]   You list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.500]   But there's also human beings in this mix.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.140]   And there is ideas of justice.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.440]   So for example, I don't want to,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.200]   my memory doesn't serve me well,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.160]   on which wars were seen as justice,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.600]   very, very few in the 20th century
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.820]   of the many that have been there.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.560]   The wars that were seen as just,
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.920]   first of all, the most just war
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.240]   is seen as World War II by far.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.160]   It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.120]   as seen as just, everything is seen as unjust.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.500]   It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.320]   And I think the ones that are seen as more just
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.820]   are the ones that are fast,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.100]   that you have a very specific purpose,
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.560]   you communicate that purpose honestly
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.280]   with the global community,
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.560]   and you strike hard, fast, and you pull out.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.920]   To do sort of, it's like rescue missions.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.600]   It's almost like policing work.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.980]   If there's somebody suffering,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.800]   you go in and stop that suffering directly, and that's it.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.180]   I think World War II is seen in that way,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.600]   that there's an obvious aggressor
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.640]   that is causing a lot of suffering in the world
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.960]   and looking to expand the scale of that suffering,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   and so you strike, I mean, given the scale,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.480]   you strike as hard and as fast as possible
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.880]   to stop the expansion of the suffering.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.160]   And so that's kind of how they see.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.620]   I don't know if you can kind of look
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.520]   with this framework that you've presented
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.240]   and look at Hitler and think,
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:48.000]   Poland, Britain, France, Russia, the Soviet Union,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.800]   America, the United States of America,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.440]   same with Japan, is it in their long-term interest?
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.960]   It's for me, who cares about alleviating
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   human suffering in the world, yes, it's not.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.440]   It seems like almost no war is just,
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.480]   but it also seems somehow deeply human to fight,
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.240]   and I think your book makes the case, no, it's not.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.080]   Can you try to get at that?
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.120]   'Cause it seems that war, there is some,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.000]   that drum of war seems to beat in all human hearts.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.480]   It's in there somewhere.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.160]   Maybe it's, maybe there's a relic of the past
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.400]   and we need to get rid of it.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.640]   It's deeply irrational.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.080]   - Okay, so obviously we go to war,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.440]   and obviously there's a lot of violence,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.760]   and so we have to explain something,
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.880]   and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.800]   So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   I think it was just useful to sort of start
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.160]   and point out, actually,
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.760]   there's really, really, really, really strong incentives
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.840]   not to go to war, because it's gonna be really costly.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.040]   And so all of these other human or strategic things,
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.520]   all these things, the circumstantial things
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.040]   that will eventually lead us to go to war
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.680]   have to be pretty powerful before we go there,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.360]   and most of the time--
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.760]   - Sorry to interrupt, and that's why you also describe,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.240]   very importantly, that war throughout human history
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.600]   is actually rare.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.760]   We usually avoid it.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.240]   - You know, most people don't know about
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.880]   the US invasion of Haiti in 1994.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.080]   I mean, a lot of people know about it,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.680]   but people just don't pay attention to it.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.600]   We don't, we're gonna, you know,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.520]   the history books and school kids are gonna learn
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.560]   about the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades,
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.480]   and nobody's going to put this one in the history books,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.400]   and it's because it didn't actually happen,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.520]   because before the troops could land,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.200]   the person who'd taken power in a coup
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.920]   basically said, "Fine."
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.160]   There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti,
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.560]   to this new dictator who's refused
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.160]   to let a democratic president take power,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.800]   and tries to convince him to step down or else,
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.720]   and he says, "No, no, no," and then he shows him a video,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.800]   and it's basically troop planes
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.960]   and all these things taking off,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.160]   and he's like, "This is not live.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.520]   "This is two hours ago."
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.520]   So it's a, and basically, he basically gives up right there.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.600]   So that was--
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.080]   - That's a powerful move.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.280]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.000]   I think Powell might've been one of his teachers
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.440]   in like a US military college,
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.080]   'cause a lot of these military dictators
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.480]   were trained at some point,
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.440]   so they had some, there was some personal relationships,
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.600]   at least between people in the US government and this guy,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.800]   that they were trying to use.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.720]   The point is, and that's like what should've happened.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.800]   Like, that makes sense, right?
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.000]   Like, yeah, maybe I can mount an insurgency,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.680]   and yeah, I'm not gonna bear a lot of the costs of war
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.480]   'cause I'm the dictator, and maybe he's human,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.240]   and he just wants to fight or gets angry,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.200]   or it's just in his mind whatever he's doing,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.040]   but at the end of the day, he's like,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.400]   "This does not make sense."
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.600]   And that's what happens most of the time,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.720]   but we don't write so many books about it.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.680]   And now some political scientists go,
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.040]   and they count up all of the nations that could fight
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   'cause they have some dispute,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.920]   and they're right next to one another,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.480]   or they look at the ethnic groups
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.560]   that could fight with one another
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.800]   'cause they have, there's some tension,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.280]   and they're right next to one another,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.680]   and then whatever, some number,
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.520]   like 900, 900, 900, 1,000 don't fight
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.880]   because they just find some other way.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.760]   They don't like each other, but they just loathe in peace
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.000]   because that's the sensible thing to do.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.840]   And that's what we all do.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.480]   We loathe in peace, and we loathed the Soviet Union
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.000]   in relative peace for decades,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.320]   and India loathes Pakistan in peace.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.760]   I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.800]   again, it was in the newspapers,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.440]   but most people didn't, I think, take note,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.680]   India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.660]   and calm ensued.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.420]   So they were like, yeah, this is,
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.640]   we do not wanna go to war.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.600]   This will be bad.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.920]   We'll be angry, but we'll accept your explanation
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.200]   that this was an accident.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.760]   And so these things finder the radar.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.440]   And so we overestimate, I think,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.680]   how likely it is sides are gonna fight.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.000]   But then, of course, things do happen.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.440]   Like Russia did invade the Ukraine
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.640]   and didn't find some negotiated deal.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.840]   And so then the book is sort of about,
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.640]   half the book is just sort of laying out,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.080]   actually, like, there's just different ways this breaks down
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.600]   and some of them are human.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.120]   Some of them are this,
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.200]   I actually don't think war beats in our heart.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.840]   It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.000]   As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.120]   We're really, really good.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.800]   So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence,
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.080]   and we're okay at getting angry and vengeant.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.400]   And we have principles that will sometimes lead us,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.080]   but we're actually really, really,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.040]   really good at cooperation.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.800]   And so that's, again, I'm not trying to write
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.240]   some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.800]   and we're all happy and we don't really fight.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.360]   It's more just to say, let's start,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.440]   let's be like a doctor.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.240]   As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.120]   I'm gonna try, I know there's sick people,
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.720]   but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.360]   and that most people are healthy.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.960]   And that's gonna make me a better doctor.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.320]   And I'm kind of saying the same thing.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.120]   Let's be better doctors of politics in the world
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.160]   by recognizing that the normal state is health,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.360]   and then we're gonna identify what are the diseases
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.360]   that are causing this warfare.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.160]   - So yeah, the natural state of the human body
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.600]   with the immune system and all the different parts
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.520]   wants to be healthy and is really damn good at being healthy,
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.840]   but sometimes it breaks down.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.000]   Let's understand how it breaks down.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.040]   So what are the five ways that you list
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.840]   that are the roots of war?
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.520]   - Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   They're sort of things that rhyme, right?
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.360]   'Cause it's not all the same.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.480]   There's like lots of reasons to go to war.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.120]   There's this great line,
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.560]   "There's a reason for every war and a war for every reason."
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.720]   And that's true.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.680]   And it's kind of overwhelming, right?
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.440]   And it's overwhelming for a lot of people.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.840]   It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.120]   And I think one of the gifts of social science
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.400]   is actually people have started to organize this for us.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.240]   And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.280]   - Buckets that rhyme.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.040]   - Buckets, yeah, the terrible metaphor, right?
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.880]   (laughing)
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.920]   I got it, metaphors.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.440]   So the idea was that like that basic incentive,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.040]   like something overrides these incentives.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   And I guess I was saying there's five ways
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.960]   that they get overrided.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.120]   And three are I'd call strategic.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.320]   Like they're kind of logical.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   They're circumstances that,
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.120]   and this is, they're sort of,
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.000]   where strategic is, strategy is like the game theory.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.800]   You could use those two things interchangeably,
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.640]   but game theory is sort of making it sound
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.040]   more complicated, I think, than it is.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.880]   It's basically saying that there's times
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.720]   when this is like the optimal choice
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.120]   because of circumstances.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.320]   And one of them is when the people
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.040]   who are deciding don't bear those costs.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.720]   Or maybe even have a private incentive that's gonna,
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.600]   that's, if they're ignoring the cost,
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.680]   then maybe the costs of war are not so material.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.920]   That's a contributing factor.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.080]   Another is just there's uncertainty.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.040]   And we could talk about that,
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.480]   but there's just the absence of information
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   means that it actually,
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.720]   there's circumstances where it's your best choice to attack.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.440]   There's this thing that political economists
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.600]   call commitment problems,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.000]   which are basically saying there's some big power shift
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.440]   that you can avoid by attacking now.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.840]   So it's like a dynamic incentive.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.920]   It's sort of saying, well,
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.840]   in order to keep something from happening in the future,
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.720]   I can attack now.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   And because of the structure of incentives,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.040]   it actually makes sense for me.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.440]   Even though war is in theory really costly,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.680]   or it is really costly nonetheless.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.840]   And then there's these sort of human things.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.200]   One's a little bit like just war.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.440]   One sort of thing, there's like ideologies or principles
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.920]   or things we value that weigh against those costs.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.080]   Like exterminating the heretical idea
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.440]   or standing up for a principle
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.480]   might be so valuable to me that I'm willing to use violence,
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.920]   even if it's costly.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.000]   And there's nothing irrational about that.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.960]   And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.240]   all the passions and all of the most importantly,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.200]   I think, like misperceptions, the way we get.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.840]   Like we basically make wrong calculations
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.480]   about whether or not war is the right decision we get.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.800]   We misunderstand or misjudge our enemy
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.120]   or misjudge ourselves.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.520]   - So if you put all those things into buckets,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.880]   how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.040]   and how much of it is a giant human mess?
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.120]   - So four of those five are really, on some level,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.800]   easy to think strategically and model in a simple way
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.040]   in the sense that any of us can do it.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.400]   We do this all the time.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.880]   Think of like bargaining in a market
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.700]   for a carpet or something or whatever you bargained for.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.080]   You're thinking a few steps ahead
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.920]   about what your opponent's going to do
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.680]   and you stake out a high, like a low price
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.560]   and the seller stakes out a high price.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.760]   And you might both say, oh, I refuse to,
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.880]   I could never accept that.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   And there's all this sort of cheap talk,
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.360]   but you kind of understand where you're going
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.920]   and it's efficient to like find a deal
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.660]   and buy the market, buy the carpet eventually.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.720]   So we all understand this like game theory
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.800]   and the strategy, I think intuitively.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.880]   Or maybe even a closer example is like,
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.160]   suppose, I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.000]   or any normal like kind of legal,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.440]   it's not yet a legal dispute, right?
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.040]   Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.240]   or somebody else.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.720]   Most of us don't end up going to court.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.000]   Going to court is like the war option.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.520]   That's the costly thing that we just ought to be able to,
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.360]   we ought to be able to find something between ourselves
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.120]   that doesn't require this hiring lawyers
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.320]   and a long drawn out trial.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.360]   And most of the time we do, right?
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.000]   And so we all understand that incentive.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.960]   And then for those five buckets,
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.880]   so everything except all the irrational
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.380]   and the misperceptions are really easy to model.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.680]   Then from a technical standpoint,
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.000]   it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.520]   And I'm not a game theorist.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.920]   And so I'm more channeling my colleagues who do this
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.000]   and what I know.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.080]   But it's not rocket science.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.000]   I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.480]   is like there's all these ideas out there
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.520]   that can actually help us just make sense of all these wars
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.240]   and just bring some order to the morass of reasons.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.120]   - Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.840]   So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   (Dave laughing)
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.760]   People like they--
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.480]   - I'll defer to you actually.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.380]   - Well, I think it's 'cause unfortunately,
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.520]   it's very like engineering.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.960]   It's very well defined.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.120]   The problem is well defined.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.640]   The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.520]   So it is true it's not rocket science,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.960]   but it is not true it's easy
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.560]   because it's not rocket science.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   But the problem, the downside of game theory
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.360]   is not that it helps us make sense of the world.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.160]   It projects a simple model of the world
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.200]   that brings us comfort in thinking we understand.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.920]   And sometimes that simplification
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.640]   is actually getting at the core first principles
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.440]   on understanding of something.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.000]   And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.640]   So for example, I mean, mutually assured destruction
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.720]   is a very simple model and people argue all the time
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.860]   whether that's actually a good model or not.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.880]   But there's empirical fact
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.240]   that we're still alive as a human civilization.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.080]   And also in the game theoretic sense,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.160]   do we model individual leaders and their relationships?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   Do we, the staff, the generals,
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   or do we also have to model the culture, the people,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.440]   the suffering of the people, the economic frustration
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.600]   or the anger, the distrust?
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.160]   Do you have to model all those things?
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.760]   Do they come into play?
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.840]   And sometimes, I mean, again,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.720]   we could be romanticizing those things
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   from a historical perspective.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.280]   But when you look at history
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.800]   and you look at the way wars start,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.240]   it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.960]   escalates, escalates, escalates,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.240]   and just builds on top of itself.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.320]   And all of a sudden it's an all out war.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.200]   It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.280]   - So, I mean, you're absolutely right
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.680]   like in the sense that it's totally possible
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.040]   to oversimplify these things
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.160]   and take the game theory too seriously.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   And some, and people who study those things
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.320]   and write those models and people like me who use them
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.200]   can sometimes make that mistake.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.440]   I think that's not the mistake
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.360]   that most people make most often.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.480]   And what's actually true is I think most people,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.680]   we're actually really quick,
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.040]   whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq,
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.360]   we're really quick to blame that on the humanness
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.280]   and the culture.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:14.840]   So we're really quick to say, oh, this was George W. Bush's
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.160]   either desire for revenge and vengeance
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.760]   or some private agenda or blood for oil.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.560]   So we're really quick to blame it on these things.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   And then we're really,
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.280]   we tend to overlook the strategic incentives to attack,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.600]   which I think we're probably dominant.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.860]   I think those things might've been true to a degree,
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.400]   but I don't think they were enough to ever
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.520]   bring those wars about.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.240]   Just like, I think people are very quick to sort of
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.160]   in this current invasion to sort of talk about Putin's
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.320]   grand visions of being the next Catherine the Great
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   or nationalist ideals and the mistakes
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.440]   and the miscalculations are really quick to sort of say,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.000]   oh, that must be, and then kind of pause or not pause,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.440]   but maybe even stop there
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.080]   and not see some of the strategic incentives.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.960]   And so I guess we have to do both,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.120]   but the strategic, I guess I would say like the war
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   is just such a big problem.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.560]   It's just so costly that the strategic incentives
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.160]   and the things that game theory has given us
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.680]   are like really important in understanding
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.440]   why there was so little room for negotiation in a bargain
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.240]   that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.320]   or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.080]   or vengeance actually matters.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.320]   'Cause those do matter,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.040]   but they only matter when the capacity to find a deal
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.160]   is so narrow because of the circumstances.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.640]   And so let's not, it's sort of like saying
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.880]   like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.600]   Pneumonia killed them, obviously,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.720]   but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.280]   All of the fundamentals and the circumstances
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.800]   were like made them very fragile.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.320]   And that's how I think all the strategic forces
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.960]   make that situation fragile.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.160]   And then the miscalculations and all of these things
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.320]   you just said, which are so important
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.720]   are kind of like the pneumonia.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.400]   And let's pay attention to both.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.960]   - And you're saying that people don't disproportionately
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.440]   pay attention to the--
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.280]   - It's hard.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.600]   I mean, it wasn't-- - To the leaders.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.760]   - It took me a long time to learn to recognize them.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.200]   And it takes many people.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.600]   And it took generations of social scientists
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.760]   years and years to figure some of this out
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   and to sort of help people understand it
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.960]   and clarify concepts.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.240]   So it's not, it's just not that easy.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.080]   No, it's not hard.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.320]   I think it's possible to,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.600]   just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.280]   in graduate school or from reading,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.800]   and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff,
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.000]   but it's still really hard.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.200]   And so that's kind of what I was trying to do
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.520]   is like close that gap and just make it,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.080]   help people recognize these things in the wild.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.120]   - Before we zoom back out, let me,
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.560]   at a high level first ask,
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.520]   what are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.640]   How do you analyze it within your framework about war?
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.960]   - A Russian colleague of mine, Konstantin Sonin,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.280]   tells this story about a visiting Ukrainian professor
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.120]   who's at the university.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.320]   And one night he's walking down the street
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.080]   and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.320]   And a mugger stops him and demands the phones.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.240]   And it's sort of like deadpan way, Konstantin says,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.760]   and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   And I think that's a little bit like what happened.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.240]   Most of us in that situation would hand over our cell phones.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.680]   and the Ukrainian people are being asked
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.720]   to hand over this thing.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.120]   And they're saying, no, we're not gonna hand this over.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   And the fact is, most people do.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.720]   Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.520]   or an autocrat or a murderous warlord who says,
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.360]   hand this over, they hand it over.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.320]   And that's why there are so many unequal
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.120]   imperial relationships in the world.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.040]   That's what empire is.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.520]   Empire is successive people saying, fine,
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.960]   we'll give up some degree of freedom or sovereignty
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.360]   'cause you're too powerful.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.880]   And the Ukrainian said, no way, this is just too precious.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.080]   And so I said, one of those buckets
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.240]   where that there's a set of values.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   There's sometimes there's something that we value
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.280]   that is so valuable to us and important.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.960]   Sometimes it's terrible.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   Sometimes it's the extermination of another people,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.400]   but sometimes it's something noble like liberty
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.840]   or refusal to part with sovereignty.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.960]   And in those circumstances, people will decide,
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.280]   I will endure the costs.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.400]   They probably, I mean, I think they knew
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.000]   what they were probably risking.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.740]   And so to me, that's not to blame the Ukrainians
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.240]   any more than I would blame Americans
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   for the American Revolution.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.920]   It's actually a very similar story.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.300]   You had a tyrannical, militarily superior,
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:15.560]   pretty non-democratic entity come and say,
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.460]   you're gonna have partial sovereignty.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:23.120]   And Americans for ideological reasons said, no way.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.500]   And that, people like Bernard Bailin and other historians,
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.520]   that's like the dominant story of the American Revolution.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.160]   It was in the ideological origins,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.600]   this attachment, this idea of liberty.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.160]   And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.360]   I think, why this happened.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.720]   But I think for me, it starts with Ukrainians
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.520]   failing to make that sensible, quote unquote,
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.100]   rational deal that says we should relinquish
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.720]   some of our sovereignty because Russia
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.160]   is more powerful than we are.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:55.720]   - So that's a very clinical look at the war.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.840]   Meaning there is a man and a country, Vladimir Putin,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:08.000]   that makes a claim on a land, builds up troops, and invades.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.440]   The way to avoid suffering there,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.360]   and the way to avoid death, and the way to avoid war
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   is to back down and basically let,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.280]   there's a list of interests he provides,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.100]   and you go along with that.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:35.800]   That's when the goal is to avoid war.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.360]   Let's do some other calculus.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.120]   Let's think about Britain.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   So France fought Hitler, but did not fight very hard.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.280]   Portugal, there's a lot of stories of countries like this.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   And there is Winston motherfucking Churchill.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.760]   He's one of the rare humans in history
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.920]   who had that we shall fight on the beaches.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.840]   It made no sense.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.720]   Hitler did not say he's going to destroy Britain.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.800]   He seemed to show respect for Britain.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.460]   He wanted to keep the British Empire.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.560]   It made total sense.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.580]   It was obvious that Britain was going to lose
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.160]   if Hitler goes all in on Britain
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.080]   as he seemed like he was going to.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.100]   And yet Winston Churchill said a big F you.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:31.120]   Similar thing, Zelensky and the Ukrainian people
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.640]   said F you in that same kind of way.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.960]   - So I think we're saying the same things.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.600]   I'm being more clinical about it.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.940]   - Well, I'm trying to understand, and we won't know this,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.680]   but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   - Well, on the eve of the war, Ukraine was poor
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.440]   in a per person terms than it was in 1990.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.280]   The economy's just completely stagnated.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.920]   And Russia, meanwhile, like many other parts of the region,
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.200]   sort of has boomed to a degree.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.680]   I mean, certainly because of oil and gas,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.440]   but also for a variety of other reasons.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.840]   And Putin's consolidated political control.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.640]   And from a very cold-blooded and calculated point of view,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.680]   I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.440]   is as, look, we were temporarily weak
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.520]   after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.720]   And the rest, and the West basically took advantage of that.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.560]   Like, bravo, you pulled it off.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.080]   You basically crept democracy and capitalism,
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.520]   all these things right up to our border.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.440]   And now we have regained some of our strength.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.200]   We've consolidated political control.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.700]   We've killed our people.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.860]   We have a stronger economy.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.420]   And we somehow got Germany and other European nations
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.260]   to give up energy independence.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.120]   And actually just, we've got an enormous amount
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.040]   of leverage over you.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.600]   And now we wanna roll back some of your success
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.800]   because we're powerful enough to demand it.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.400]   And you've been taking advantage of the situation,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.120]   which is maybe a fair, impartial analysis.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.080]   And the West, but more specifically Ukraine,
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.760]   said, but that's a price too high, which I totally respect.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.360]   Maybe I'd like to think I'd make that same decision.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.600]   But that's the answer.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.200]   If the answer is why would they fight if it's so costly,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.400]   why not find a deal?
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.320]   It's because they weren't willing to give Russia
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   the thing that their power said they quote unquote deserve.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.440]   Just like Americans said to the Britain,
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.180]   yeah, of course, we ought to accept semi-sovereignty.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.540]   But we refuse.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   And we'd rather endure a bloody fight that we might lose
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.080]   than take this.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   And so you need some of these other five buckets,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.840]   you need them to understand the situation.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.080]   You need to sort of, there are other things going on,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.560]   but I do think it's fundamental that there's just,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   that this noble intransigence is a big part of it.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.320]   - Well, let me just say a few things if it's okay.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   So your analysis is clear and objective.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.940]   - My analysis is neither clear nor objective.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.600]   First, I've been going through a lot.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.740]   I'm a different man over the past four or five weeks
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.840]   than I was before.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.740]   I, in general, have come to,
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:37.240]   there's anger, I've come to despise leaders in general.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.580]   Because leaders wage war
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.680]   and the people pay the price for that war.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:48.600]   Let me just say on this point of standing up to an invader,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.800]   that I am half Ukrainian, half Russian,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.320]   that I'm proud of the Ukrainian people.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   Whatever the sacrifices, whatever the scale of pain,
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.680]   standing up, there's something in me that's proud.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   Maybe that's, maybe that's, whatever the fuck that is,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.660]   maybe that blood runs in me.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.620]   I love the Ukrainian people, I love the Russian people.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.760]   And whatever that fight is, whatever that suffering is,
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.140]   the millions of refugees, whatever this war is,
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.160]   the dictators come to power and their power falls,
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.740]   I just love that that spirit burns bright still.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.140]   And I do, maybe I'm wrong in this,
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.820]   do see Ukrainian and Russian people as one people
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.340]   in a way that's not just cultural, geopolitical,
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.220]   but just given the history.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.760]   I think about the same kind of fighting
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.140]   when Hitler, with all of his forces,
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.800]   chose to invade the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.500]   When he went in that Russian winter,
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.200]   and a lot of people, and that pisses me off,
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.060]   because if you know your history,
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.520]   it's not the winter that stopped Hitler.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.520]   It's the Red Army, it's the people
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.800]   that refused to back down, they fought proudly.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.060]   That pride, that's something.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.120]   That's the human spirit.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.600]   That's in war, you know, war is hell,
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.400]   but it really pushes people to stand
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.240]   for the things they believe in.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   It's the William Wallace speech from Braveheart,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.000]   I think about this a lot.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   That does not fit into your framework.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.520]   - No, no, no, I'm gonna disagree.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.640]   I think it totally fits in, and it's this,
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.120]   there's nothing irrational about what we believe,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   especially those principles which we hold the most dear.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.500]   I'm merely trying to say that there's a calculus,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.720]   there's one calculus over here that says
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.020]   Russia's more powerful than it was 20 years ago,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.920]   and even 10 years ago, and Ukraine is not,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.200]   and it's asking for something,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.040]   and there's an incentive to give that up.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.680]   That's obvious, like there's an incentive to comply.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.600]   But my understanding is many of these
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.400]   post-Soviet republics have appeased, right,
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.100]   which is what we call compromise when we disagree with it.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.840]   They've, all of these other peoples
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.720]   in the Russian sphere of influence have not stood up.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.760]   And Russians, many Russians have tried to stand up,
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.200]   and they've been beaten down.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.360]   And now people have, we'll see,
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.000]   but people have not been standing up very much.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.480]   And so lots of people are cowed,
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.840]   and lots of people have appeased,
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.920]   and lots of people hear that speech
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.240]   and think I would like to do that, but don't.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.940]   And so, and my point is that sadly,
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.880]   we live in a world where a lot of people
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.280]   get stepped on by tyrants and empire and whatnot,
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.240]   and don't rise up.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.720]   And so I think we could admire, especially
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.760]   when they stand up for these reasons.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.680]   And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.720]   I think we could, that's why we admire
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.000]   the leaders of the American revolution and so on.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.120]   But it doesn't always happen,
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.840]   and I don't actually know why.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.080]   But I don't think it's irrational.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.840]   I think it's just, it's something,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.080]   it's about a set of values, and it's hard to predict.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.200]   And it was hard for, Putin might not have been
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.320]   out of line in thinking just like everybody else
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.080]   in my sphere of influence, they're gonna roll over too.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.640]   - And I should mention, because we haven't,
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.520]   that a lot of this calculation,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.520]   from an objective point of view,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.920]   you have to include United States and NATO
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.240]   into the pressure they apply into the region.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.360]   - Yeah.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.480]   - That said, I care little about leaders
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.040]   that do cruel things onto the world.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.560]   They lead to a lot of suffering.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.800]   But I still believe that the Russian people
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.720]   and the Ukrainian people are great people that stand up,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.160]   and I admire people that stand up
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.400]   and are willing to give their life.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   And I think Russian people are very much that too,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:15.520]   especially when the enemy is coming
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.680]   for your home over the hill.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.440]   Sometimes standing up to an authoritarian regime
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.200]   is difficult because you don't know,
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:30.440]   it's not a monster that's attacking your home directly.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.160]   It's kind of like the boiling of a lobster
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.520]   or something like that.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.280]   It's a slow control of your mind and the population.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.200]   And our minds get controlled even in the West
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.520]   by the media, by the narratives.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.200]   It's very difficult to wake up one day
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   and to realize sort of what people call red-pilled,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.240]   is to see that they're,
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.800]   maybe the thing I've been told all my life is not true.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.200]   And at every level, that's a thing very difficult
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.320]   to do in North Korea.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.080]   The more authoritarian the regime,
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.460]   the more difficult it is to see.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.480]   Maybe this idea that I believe
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.560]   that I was willing to die for is actually evil.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.260]   It's very difficult to do for Americans,
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.000]   for Russians, for Ukrainians, for Chinese,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.560]   for Indians, for Pakistanis, for everybody.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.280]   I think thinking about this Ukrainian,
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.200]   whether you want to call it nobility or intransigence
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.440]   or whatever is key.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.280]   I think the authoritarianness of Russia
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.480]   and Putin's control or the control of his cabal
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.300]   is the other thing I would really point to
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.440]   is what's going on here.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.240]   And if you ask me like big picture,
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.720]   what do I think is the fundamental cause
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.840]   of most violence in the world?
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.560]   I think it's unaccountable power.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.920]   I think, in fact, for me, an unaccountable power
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.280]   is the source of underdevelopment.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.840]   It's the source of pain and suffering.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.960]   It's the source of warfare.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.200]   It's basically the root source of most of our problems.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.600]   And in this particular case,
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.280]   it's also one of our buckets in the sense that,
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.560]   like why, what is it that,
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.160]   why did Russia ask these things?
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.800]   Like, well, was democracy in Ukraine
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.640]   a threat to an average Russian?
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.480]   No.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.600]   Was capitalism, is NATO, is whatever,
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.600]   is this a threat to average Russians?
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.600]   No, it's a threat to the apparatus of political control
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.560]   and economic control that Putin and cronies
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.280]   and the sort of group of people that rule,
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.640]   this elite in Russia, it was a threat to them.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.300]   And so they had to ask the Ukraine to be neutral
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.560]   or to give up NATO or to have a puppet government
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.800]   or whatever they were seeking to achieve
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.680]   and have been trying to achieve through other means
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.280]   for decades, right?
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.640]   They've been trying to undermine these things
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.600]   without invasion.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.880]   And they've been doing that
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.480]   because it threatens their interests.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.280]   And that's like one of these other logics of war.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.240]   It's not just that there's something that I value so much
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.560]   that I'm willing to endure the cost.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.800]   It's that there are people,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.040]   not only does this oligarchy or whatever elite group
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.840]   that you wanna talk about in Russia,
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.040]   not, first of all, they're not bearing,
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.400]   they're bearing some costs of war, right?
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.760]   They're very, and they're certainly
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.120]   bearing costs of sanctions.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.560]   But they don't bear all the costs of war, obviously.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.280]   And so they're quick to use it.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.000]   But more importantly, in some sense,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.600]   I think there's a strong argument
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.640]   that they had a political incentive to invade
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.800]   or at least to ask Ukraine this sort of
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.500]   impossible to give up thing,
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   and then invade despite Ukrainian nobility and transigence
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.780]   because they were threatened.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:45.120]   And so that's extremely important, I think.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.960]   And so that's, those two things in concert
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.760]   make this a very fragile situation.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.440]   That's I think why we ended up,
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.040]   is go not all the way, but a long way to understanding.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.960]   Now you could layer onto that,
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.320]   these intangible incentives,
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.760]   these other things that are valued,
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.280]   that are valued on Putin's side.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.800]   Maybe there's a nationalist ideal.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.200]   Maybe he seeks status and glory.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.280]   Like maybe those things are all true,
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.880]   and I'm sure they're true to an extent.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.560]   And that'll weigh against his costs of war as well.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.680]   But fundamentally, I think he just saw
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.560]   his regime as threatened.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.160]   That's what he cares about.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.160]   And so he asked, he made this cruelest of demands.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.440]   - I mean, I would say I'm just one human,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.640]   who the hell am I?
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.920]   But I just have a lot of anger
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.520]   towards the elites in general,
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.800]   towards leaders in general that fail the people.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   I would love to hear and to celebrate
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.800]   the beautiful Russian people, the Ukrainian people,
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:52.440]   and anyone who silences that beautiful voice of the people,
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.040]   anywhere in the world,
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:59.000]   is destroying the thing that I value most about humanity.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.080]   Leaders don't matter.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.480]   They're supposed to serve the people.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.080]   This nationalist idea of a people, of a country,
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.280]   is only makes any sense when you celebrate,
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:15.280]   when you give people the freedom to show themselves,
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.360]   to celebrate themselves.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.760]   The thing I care most about is science
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   and the silencing of voices in the scientific community,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.840]   the silencing of voices, period.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:34.860]   Fuck any leader that silences that human spirit.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.280]   There's something about this.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.160]   Whenever I look at World War II,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.280]   whenever I look at wars,
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.540]   it does seem very irrational to fight.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:52.400]   But man, does it seem somehow deeply human
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.920]   when the people stand up and fight.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.400]   There's something that if,
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.800]   you know, we talked about progress.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.880]   That feels like how progress is made,
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.320]   the people that stand and fight.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.360]   So, but let me read the Churchill speech.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.320]   It's such, I'm so proud that we humans
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.880]   can stand up to evil when the time is right.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.680]   - I guess here's the thing, though.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.480]   Think of what's happening in Xinjiang in China.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.520]   We have appeased China.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.080]   We've basically said, you can just do
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.880]   really, really, really horrible things in this region
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.480]   and you're too powerful for us to do anything about it
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.040]   and it's not worth it.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.760]   And there's nobody standing up and making a Churchill speech
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.200]   or the Braveheart speech about standing up
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.480]   for people of Xinjiang when what's happening is,
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:47.520]   on, you know, in that realm of what was happening in Europe.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.240]   And that's happening in a lot of places.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.660]   And then when we, when there is a willingness to stand up,
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:58.000]   people, there's a lot of opposition to those.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.040]   You know, so there were a lot of reasons
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.280]   for the invasion of Iraq.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.160]   For some, it was humanitarian.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.480]   I think like, Saddam Hussein was one of the worst tyrants
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.600]   of the 20th century.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.240]   He was just doing some really horrible things.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.880]   You know, he'd invaded Kuwait.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.680]   He'd, you know, committed domestic,
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.880]   attempted domestic genocide and all sorts of repression.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.000]   And it was probably a mistake to invade in spite.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.360]   So it's important not just to select on the cases
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.640]   where we stood up and to select on the cases
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.380]   where that ended up working out in the sense of victory.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.480]   Right, it's important to sort of try to judge,
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.680]   not judge, but just try to understand these things
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.160]   in the context of all the times we didn't give that speech
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.080]   or when we did and then it just went sideways.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.520]   - Well, that's why it's powerful
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.880]   when you're willing to give your life for your principles
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.460]   'cause most of the time you get neither the principles
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.720]   nor the life, you die.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.280]   That's what, but that's why it's powerful.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.560]   We shall go on to the end.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.340]   We shall fight in France.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.840]   We shall fight on the seas and the oceans.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.800]   We shall fight with growing confidence
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.600]   and growing strength in the air.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.160]   We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.000]   We shall fight on the beaches.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.320]   We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.480]   We shall fight in the field and in the streets.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.320]   We shall fight in the hills.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.200]   We shall never surrender.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   This is before Hitler had any major loss to anybody.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.220]   That was a terrifying armada coming your way.
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.840]   We shall never surrender.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.280]   I just wanna give props.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.640]   I wanna give my respect as a human being to Churchill,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.660]   to the British people for standing up,
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:50.200]   to the Ukrainian people for standing up
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.880]   and to the Russian people.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.640]   These are great people that throughout history
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.680]   have stood up to evil.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:03.600]   Let me ask you this because you quote Sun Tzu
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.360]   in "The Art of War."
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.800]   "There's no instance of a country having benefited
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.480]   from prolonged warfare."
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.800]   This is the main thesis.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.840]   Can we just linger on this?
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.320]   Since leaders wage war and people pay the price,
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.880]   when we say that there's no reason to do prolonged war,
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.040]   is it possible to have a reason for the leaders
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.640]   if they disregard the price?
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.040]   Sort of like if they have a different objective function
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.000]   or utility function that measures the price
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.360]   that's paid for war.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.500]   Is that one explanation of why war happens?
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.480]   Is the leaders just have a different calculus
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.040]   than other humans?
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.280]   - I mean, I think this links us back
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.320]   to what we were talking about earlier about just war.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.600]   Is in some sense just war is saying
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.600]   that in spite of the costs,
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.720]   that our enemy has done something,
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.060]   our opponent has refused to compromise
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.560]   on something that we find essential
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   and is demanding that we compromise
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.440]   in a way that's completely repugnant.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.240]   And therefore we're going to go to war
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:13.200]   despite these material costs and these human costs.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.760]   And then that principle that you go to war on
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.840]   is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.000]   And I mean, I think liberty and sovereignty,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.760]   I think we can understand and sympathize with.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.520]   And maybe that's just a universal,
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.520]   maybe that's the greatest cause of just war,
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.000]   but other people make that,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.120]   could go to war for something considerably less,
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.600]   a principle that's considerably less noble, right?
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.160]   Which is what Hitler was doing.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.360]   That's an explanation.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.720]   So that's a whole class of explanations
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.960]   that helps us understand that the compromise
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.880]   that was on the table,
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.280]   given the relative balance of power
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.480]   was just repugnant at least to one side,
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.320]   if not the other.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.120]   There's something they're unwilling to part with.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.200]   And then you get to the leaders.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.240]   Well, what happens when what the leaders want,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.960]   what happens when the leaders are detached
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.160]   from the interests of their groups,
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.280]   which has been true for basically most of human history.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.600]   There's a narrow slice of societies
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.520]   in the big scheme of things
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.920]   that have been accountable to their people.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.380]   A lot of them exist today.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:13.160]   Where to some degree they're channeling
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.480]   the interests of their group, right?
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.840]   So the Ukrainian politicians didn't concede
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.960]   to these cool Russian demands,
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.040]   because even if they had,
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.360]   it would have been political suicide.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.240]   Because it seemed, or I think,
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.120]   it seems that the Ukrainians would have just rejected this.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.280]   So they were in some sense channeling
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.080]   the values of the broader population.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.120]   Even if they, I don't know what was going,
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.280]   even if they didn't share those principles,
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.840]   they self-interestedly followed them.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.800]   Probably they shared them,
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.040]   but I'm just saying that even if they didn't,
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.280]   they wouldn't compromise.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.760]   Occasionally you get the reverse,
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.360]   which is where the leaders are not accountable.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.220]   And now they have some value, which could be glory.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.720]   I mean, this is the story of the kings,
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.260]   and to some lesser extent, the queens of Europe.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.260]   For hundreds of years, it was basically a contest,
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.240]   and it was, war was the sport of kings.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.520]   And to some extent, they were just seeking status
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.640]   through violent competition.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.560]   And they paid a lot, a big price out of the royal purse,
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.400]   but they didn't bear most of the suffering.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.800]   And so they were too quick to go to war.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:29.200]   combined with, you mingle it with this,
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.240]   that one bucket, that uncheckedness,
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.760]   and you mingle that with the fact
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.120]   that leaders might have one of these values,
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.180]   noble or otherwise, that carry them to war,
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.560]   combined to explain a good number of conflicts as well.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.120]   And that's a good illustration of why I think,
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:50.400]   like autocracy and unaccountable power is,
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.360]   I could make that story for all of the things,
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.840]   all five buckets, they're all,
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.960]   we're all more susceptible to these things,
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.080]   to all five of these things,
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.640]   when leaders are not accountable to the people
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.680]   and their group.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.920]   And that's what makes it like the meta,
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.120]   for me, the meta cause of conflict in all of human history,
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.180]   and sadly today.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.700]   - Does the will to power play into this,
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.280]   the desire for power?
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.500]   Like that's a human thing again, in the calculation that,
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.740]   shall we put that in the misperceptions bucket?
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.780]   Or is it, is misperceptions essentially
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:31.620]   about interaction between humans and power
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:35.260]   is more about the thing you feel in your heart
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.880]   when you're alone as a leader?
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.480]   - You know, I said there were three strategic reasons,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.600]   like the unchecked leaders,
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.200]   the commitment problems, uncertainty.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.320]   There are two sort of more psychological,
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.440]   and I call them intangible incentives and misperceptions.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.720]   The way that like a game theorist,
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.520]   or the way that a behavioral economist
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.880]   would think about those two is just to say preferences,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.120]   and then erroneous beliefs and mistakes.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.260]   It's like, so the preferences are our preferences, right?
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.980]   And so utility functions, whatever we wanna call it,
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.720]   like there's not, that's why I wouldn't call them
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.640]   a misperception or rationality.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.720]   We want, we like what we like.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.800]   If we like power, if we like relative status,
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   if we like our racial purity, if we like our liberty,
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.040]   if we like whatever it is that we
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.000]   have convinced ourselves we value.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.560]   - Maybe you fell in love with a rival queen or king.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.400]   - Exactly.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.300]   When I said it was a big bucket full of stuff that rhymes,
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.440]   like that's a pretty messy bucket.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.120]   Like there's a lot of different stuff in there.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.400]   And I'm just trying to say like,
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   let's be clear that just about the shared logic
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.960]   of these things is maybe just, you know,
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.840]   they're really dissimilar,
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.160]   but let's be clear about the shared logic.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.840]   And if it were true that deep down we were aggressive people
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.520]   who just liked violence and enjoyed the blood,
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.120]   or some percentage of us do, that would be there too.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.120]   And so I just wanna say that's,
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.440]   but you know, we're really quick to recognize those, right?
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.520]   When we diagnose a war as an armchair analyst
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.600]   or as a journalist or something, we really jump to those.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.100]   We don't need a lot of help to like see those happening.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:17.040]   So we probably put a little bit too much emphasis on them,
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.340]   is maybe the only thing that I would caution.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.080]   Because the others are more subtle,
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.920]   and they're often there, and they contribute.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.800]   - So just to look at something you said before,
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.680]   would it be accurate to say when the leaders become detached
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.080]   from the opinion of the people,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.720]   that's more likely to lead to war?
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.080]   So--
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.720]   - In mechanically, it's just,
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.320]   they're gonna bear fewer costs.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.400]   So it's gonna basically narrow the set of deals
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.320]   that they're gonna be willing to accept instead of violence.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.880]   At the same time, most of the time, it's not enough
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.360]   because the leaders still bear a lot of costs of war.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.000]   You could be deposed, you could be killed,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.720]   you could be tried, and the public purse
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.800]   is going to be empty.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.560]   That's like the one story throughout history,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.640]   is at the end of the day, your regime is broke
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.680]   as a result of war.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.320]   And so you still internalize that a little bit.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.480]   If I had to say like, in my three buckets,
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.560]   or through my buckets so far,
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.900]   I sort of started with like Ukrainian intransigence,
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.800]   and then I jumped, and then I said the essential,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.000]   then you really have to understand Russian autocracy
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.240]   for just to understand why they would ask
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.320]   something so cruel.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.400]   But I mean, I think the uncertainty
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.120]   is really important here as well.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.800]   Like if you think of it, like think of all the things,
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.240]   the way this has played out, and just in some ways,
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.840]   how many, in how many ways we've been surprised.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.000]   We've been surprised by the unity and the coherence
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.600]   of the West and the sanctions.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.080]   That sort of, what's happened is it was in the realm
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.640]   of possibility, but it was sort of like
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.840]   the best case scenario from the perspective of the West
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.160]   and the worst case scenario for the Russians.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.200]   The second thing is just the pluckiness
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.640]   and the effectiveness and the intransigence
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.960]   and the nobility of this Ukrainian resistance.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.960]   That's, again, was within the realm of possibility,
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.080]   but wasn't necessarily the likely thing, right?
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.520]   It was again, maybe the worst realization for Russia,
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.440]   the best realization in some sense for,
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.880]   in terms of revealed strength and resolve.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.280]   And then the other thing that's been revealed
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.160]   is just how, like the corruption and ineptitude
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.720]   and problems on the Russian military side.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.880]   Again, within the realm of possibility,
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.720]   maybe people who really knew the Russian military
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.560]   are less surprised than the rest of us,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.480]   but also one of the worst possible draws for Russia.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.400]   And so Putin asking this terrible price
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.040]   and expecting Ukraine to roll over,
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.340]   or the West to roll over at least to a degree,
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.800]   was based on like a different set of probability.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.960]   It was based on just expecting something
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.760]   in the middle of the probability distribution
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.200]   and not one of all these different tail events.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.880]   And so the fact that the world's so uncertain
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.600]   and the fact that Putin can come with
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.160]   a different set of expectations
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.680]   than the Ukrainians and the West,
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.960]   and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.680]   on just what the facts are,
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.940]   because we live in an uncertain world.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.720]   Everyone's quick to say, "Oh, he miscalculated."
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.040]   Well, I'm not, I don't know if he miscalculated.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040]   I think he just, he got a really bad draw
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.240]   in terms of what the realized outcomes are here.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.220]   And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense,
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.920]   except the fact that it's involving
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.240]   a lot of violence as the tragedy.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.640]   - Well, there's also economic pain,
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.140]   not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people,
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.240]   but the whole world.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   So, you could talk about things
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.060]   that we are surprised from an analysis perspective
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.740]   of small victories here or there,
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.660]   but I think it's universally true
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:55.580]   that everybody loses once again in this war.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.740]   - Right, and so the question is just like,
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:01.080]   when does it, you know, why did Russia choose to invade
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.780]   when Ukraine didn't give this up?
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.740]   Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.540]   what it wanted.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.220]   The available bargain that it deserved, quote unquote,
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.580]   based on its power in the world,
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.700]   it wasn't getting, and so it thought it could take that.
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.500]   And the uncertainty around that made it
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.020]   potentially more likely that he would choose to do this.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.380]   But in particular, one of the other things
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.140]   that I think is probably less important in this context,
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:30.620]   but still plays a role, but less important than many wars,
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.180]   is the fact that it's really hard
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.460]   to resolve that uncertainty, right?
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.060]   In theory, Ukraine should be able to say,
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.580]   "Look, this is exactly how resolved we are.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.560]   "We're super resolved.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.820]   "And your military is not as strong as you think it is."
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.940]   - You mean before the conflict even begins?
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.780]   - Everybody should be like, you know what?
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.620]   - You lay on the table, here's my cards.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.460]   - No one wants, yeah.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.280]   - Here's your cards.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.100]   - Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this,
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.980]   you can use that uncertainty to your advantage.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.300]   I can try to convince you, I can bluff, right?
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.160]   And so anyone who's ever played poker
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.980]   and bluffed or called a bluff, that's the inefficient,
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.740]   that's the analogy in some ways to war.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.140]   It's not the perfect analogy,
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.460]   but the uncertainty and the circumstances,
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.460]   you don't have to miscalculate.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.300]   The fact that if you bluff and lose,
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.200]   it doesn't mean that you miscalculated.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.840]   You made an optimal choice,
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.180]   given the uncertainty of the situation, to take a gamble.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.440]   And that was a wiser thing for you to do than to not bluff
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   and just to fold or to just not pay in that round.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.640]   And so the uncertainty of the situation
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.400]   gives both sides incentives to bluff,
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.200]   gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.920]   And then at some point, the other side says,
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.760]   "You know what?
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.380]   "You say you're resolved.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.380]   "You say you're going to mount an uncertainty.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:42.280]   "Well, guess what?
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:48.580]   "Every other people on my border has folded,
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.060]   "and you're going to fold too,
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.980]   "the minute the tanks roll in
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.460]   "and the minute the Air Force comes in.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.320]   "I'm gambling that you're bluffing."
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:01.180]   And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:05.760]   just causes a lot of short wars actually,
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.460]   because it's the sort of bluff and call dynamic
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.460]   that goes on.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:14.980]   And the thing that's worth reckoning is we might end up
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.860]   at a place in a few months where the thing
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.440]   that Ukraine concedes is not so far
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.300]   from what Russia demanded in the first place.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.660]   Russia's on it, I want a neutral,
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.780]   I mean, who knows how,
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.420]   it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted,
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.780]   but if we end up in a place where Ukraine
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:39.580]   is effectively neutral, never joins NATO,
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.780]   is not being militarily supplied by the West,
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:48.660]   and where Russia has de facto control over the East
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.980]   and Crimea, if not fully recognized,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.140]   who knows if they'll get ever internationally
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.520]   and Ukrainian recognized, but effectively controls,
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:03.060]   Russia will have accomplished what it asked
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.620]   for in the first place,
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:08.600]   and both parties had to get there through violence
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.460]   rather than through negotiation.
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.660]   And you wouldn't need misperceptions and mistakes,
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:18.660]   and you wouldn't need Putin's delusions of glory
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:20.000]   or whatever to get there,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.900]   you would just need the ingredients I've given so far,
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.520]   which is like an unwillingness to do that without fighting
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.020]   on the part of the Ukrainians,
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:31.300]   an autocratic leadership in Russia
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.020]   who would make those demands
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.420]   because it's in their self-interest
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.260]   and then uncertainty leading them to fight.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.540]   And that sadly is like the best case,
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.000]   it feels like the best case scenario right now,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.980]   which is the war is just five months and not five years.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.980]   - Given the current situation.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.200]   - Given the current situation.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.500]   - Because the suffering has already happened,
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.420]   and lost homes, people moving,
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.860]   having to see their home in rubble
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.900]   and millions of people, refugees,
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.720]   having to escape the country,
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:21.780]   and hate flourishes versus the common humanity
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.740]   as it does with war.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.060]   And on top of all of that,
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.540]   if we talk from a geopolitical perspective,
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:34.540]   the warmongers all over the world are sort of drooling.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:39.100]   They now have got narratives
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.240]   and they got that whatever narratives,
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.420]   you can go shopping for the narratives.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.340]   The United States has its narratives
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.540]   for whatever geopolitical thing it wants to do
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.860]   in that part of the world.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:53.500]   - That's another little malevolent interaction
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.620]   between two of these buckets,
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.800]   like those unchecked leaders
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.540]   and those intangible incentives, those preferences,
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:03.380]   is that unchecked leaders spent, autocrats, whatever,
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.940]   spend enormous amounts of time
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.820]   trying to manipulate the values and beliefs
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.140]   of their population, of their group.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.380]   Now, sometimes they do it nobly,
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.060]   but that's what Winston Churchill there was trying to,
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.500]   it's not clear that Britons were like ready to stand up.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.900]   There were a lot of Americans and a lot of Britons
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.840]   who were like, you know what?
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.820]   Hitler, not such a bad guy, his ideas, not so terrible.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.380]   I never liked those Jews anyways.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.980]   Many were thinking, right?
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.420]   We had political leaders in the US
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.240]   who were basically not pro-Nazi,
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.660]   but were just not anti-Nazi.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:40.740]   And Churchill was just trying to instill a different resolve.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.660]   He was trying to create that thing.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.180]   He was trying to create that value.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.100]   And in the American Revolution, it was as well.
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.860]   The founding fathers, the leaders of the revolution,
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.100]   it's not that everybody just woke up one morning
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.060]   in the United States
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.180]   and had this ideology of liberty and freedom.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.660]   Some of that was true, it was out there in the ether,
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:57.860]   but they had to manufacture and create it
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.140]   in a way that I think they believed and was noble.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.860]   But there's a lot of manufacturing and creation
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.660]   of these values and principles that is not noble.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.020]   And that is exactly what Hitler did so well.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.060]   - Yeah.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.260]   The anti-Semitism was present throughout the world,
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.980]   but the more subtle thing that I feel like
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.700]   may be more generally applicable
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.980]   is this kind of pacifism
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:30.260]   that I think people in the United States felt like,
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.260]   "It's not my conflict.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.300]   "Why do I need to get involved with it?"
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:38.300]   And I think Churchill was fighting that, the general-
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.860]   - Apathy.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:46.100]   - It's the apathy of rational calculus.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:51.060]   It's like, "What are we going to gain if we fight back?"
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.780]   Like, Hitler seems to be pretty reasonable.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.660]   He's saying he's going to stop the bombing,
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.960]   that you're still going to maintain your sovereignty
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.460]   as the great people of Britain.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.780]   Like, "Why are we fighting again?"
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.900]   And that's the thing that's hard to break
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.060]   because you have to say,
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.420]   "Well, you have to speak to principle.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.980]   "You have to speak at some greater
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:19.580]   "sort of long-term vision of history."
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:23.980]   So like, yes, now it may seem like
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:26.100]   it's a way to avoid the fight,
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.660]   but you're actually just sort of putting shackles
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:29.500]   on yourself.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.960]   You're destroying the very greatness of our people
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.380]   if we don't fight back.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.900]   - And to think about this with the current case with Russia,
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.620]   I mean, some people look at Putin's speeches
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.380]   and papers he's written on Ukraine
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.780]   historically being a part of Russia
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.320]   and trying to deny the,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.540]   basically create all these nationalist narratives.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.380]   And they think, "Well, Putin really believes,"
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.180]   and he might, "Putin really believes this,
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.580]   "and that's why he's invading."
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.380]   And that might also be true,
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:02.940]   and that would contribute to just make a peaceful bargain
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.140]   even harder to find.
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.140]   But I suspect what's at least a minimum true
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:11.660]   is Putin's trying to manufacture support for an invasion
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.700]   in the population through propaganda.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:19.660]   And so he's doing on some level the same thing
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:23.380]   that Winston Churchill was doing in mechanical terms,
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.380]   which is to try to manipulate people's references,
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:31.460]   but doing it in a sinister, malevolent, evil,
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.780]   self-serving way because it's really in his interest,
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.380]   whereas this was anything but, right,
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.780]   in the Churchill example.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.740]   - The dark human thing is like,
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.420]   there's moments in World War II
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.580]   where Hitler's propaganda,
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.420]   he began to believe his own propaganda.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.900]   - I think he probably always believed,
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.020]   I think he was a sincere believer.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.540]   - Well, no, no, no, but there's a lot of places
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.620]   where there was uncertainty,
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.180]   and they decided to do propaganda,
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.220]   and that propaganda resolved the uncertainty
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.220]   in his own mind.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.540]   So for example, he believed until very late
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:15.340]   that America is a weakling militarily
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.900]   and as an economic power and just the spirit of the people.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.580]   And that was part of the propaganda they're producing,
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.100]   and because of that propaganda,
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.540]   when he became the head of the army,
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.540]   he was making military actions,
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:30.860]   he nonchalantly started war with America,
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.540]   with the United States of America,
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.180]   where he didn't need to at all.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.700]   He could've avoided that completely,
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:39.100]   but he thought, eh, whatever, they're easy.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.540]   So that's, I think that propaganda first, belief second.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:46.700]   And I think as a human being, as a dictator,
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.180]   when you start to believe the lies
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.260]   with which you're controlling the populace,
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.700]   you're not able to, you become detached
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.020]   from this person that's able to resolve
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:00.540]   in a very human way the conflict in the world.
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.500]   - I mean, when I said the meta,
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.780]   the big common factor that causes war
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.780]   and over and over and over again is unaccountable power,
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.620]   it's not just because it's mechanically,
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.380]   like one of my five explanations to saying,
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.980]   well, if you're unaccountable, you don't bear the cost
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.860]   of war, you might have private incentives.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.860]   So yes, bargains are harder to find,
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.180]   but it leads to all these nasty interactions.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.740]   So earlier I said there's this interaction
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.820]   between the values and the unchecked leaders,
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.700]   because those idiosyncratic values of your leader
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.940]   become more important when they're unchecked.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.180]   But the uncertainty point you just made
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.140]   is like a deep point.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.940]   It's to say actually that like the fundamental problem
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.300]   that all autocrats have is an information problem,
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.300]   because nobody wants to give them the right information.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.780]   And they have very few ways to aggregate information
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.460]   if they're not popular, right?
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:49.340]   And so there's a whole cottage industry
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.380]   of political science sort of talking about
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:55.460]   why autocrats love fixed elections
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.900]   and why they love Twitter and why they actually like it
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.380]   in a controlled way, it solves an information problem.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.020]   Like that's your crucial, if you're like Xi Jinping
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.900]   or Vladimir Putin, you need to solve an information problem
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.820]   just to avoid having a rebellion on your hands
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.340]   in your own country every day.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.500]   Because uncertainty kind of gets magnified
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.260]   and you get all this distorted information
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.620]   in this apparatus of control.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.340]   And so that's like another nasty interaction
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.700]   between uncertainty and unchecked leaders
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.700]   is you end up in this situation
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.420]   where you're getting bad information.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:31.020]   And it's not that you believe your own lies,
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.100]   it's just that you never, you sort of believe,
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.300]   you're sort of averaging what you believe
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.780]   over the available information
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.060]   and you don't realize that it's such a distorted
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.600]   and biased information source.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.100]   - One of the other things about this time
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.820]   that was a surprise to me in the fog of uncertainty,
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:55.900]   how sort of seemingly likely nuclear war became,
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:02.700]   not likely, but how it--
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.980]   - Less unlikely than before.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.620]   - Exactly, that's a better way to say it.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.500]   It started to take a random stroll
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.380]   away from 0% probability into this kind of land
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.740]   of maybe like, it's hard to know,
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.580]   but it's like, oh wow, we're actually normally
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.940]   talking about this as if this is part of the calculus,
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.220]   part of the options.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.180]   But before we talk about nuclear war,
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:26.700]   'cause I'm gonna need a drink,
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.660]   do you need to go to the bathroom?
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:29.960]   - Sure, I'll take a break.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.540]   - So back to nuclear war.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.740]   What do you think about this,
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.940]   that people were nonchalantly speaking about nuclear wars
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:42.300]   if it doesn't lead to the potential annihilation
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.960]   of the human species?
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.220]   What are the chances that our world
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.020]   ascends into nuclear war?
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.740]   Within your framework, you wear many hats.
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:57.740]   One is sort of the analyst, right?
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:01.460]   And then one is a human.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.740]   What do you think are the chances
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.260]   we get to see nuclear war in the century?
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.140]   - Well, you know, the official doomsday clock
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:11.460]   for nuclear warfare sits in the lobby of my building.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.980]   The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.580]   sort of shares a building with us.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.300]   So it's always there every day.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.060]   - Can you describe what the doomsday clock is?
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.580]   - The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists,
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.900]   it's something that this group of physicists
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.000]   sort of said to sort of mark just how close we are
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.220]   to nuclear catastrophe, and they started it decades ago.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.180]   And it's a clock, and it's sort of how close
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.900]   are we to midnight, where midnight is nuclear Armageddon
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.140]   or the destruction of humanity?
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.860]   And it's been sitting, I mean, it's actually,
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.860]   it hasn't moved as close to midnight
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:44.060]   in the last few weeks as it probably should have
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:47.260]   only because it was already so close.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.200]   There's actually limited room for it to move
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.340]   for a bunch of other reasons.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.260]   I think it's, there's a whole political thing
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:55.760]   that it's really hard, it's really easy to move it closer.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.300]   And it's really hard if you're the person
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.380]   in charge of that clock to move it away, right?
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:00.860]   Because that's always very controversial.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:03.420]   So it always sits there, but it forces you
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.460]   to think about it a little bit every day.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:12.620]   And I admit I was nonchalant about it until recently
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:16.760]   in a way that many, many other people were.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.640]   I still think the risk is very low,
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.860]   but kind of for the reasons we've talked,
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.580]   it's just so unimaginably costly
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.460]   that nobody wants to go that route.
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:33.740]   So it's like the extreme version of my whole argument
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.700]   was why we most of the time don't fight
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.940]   is because it's just so damn costly.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:41.060]   And so this is, that's the incentive not to use this.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.300]   And if they do use it, that's the incentive
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.200]   to use it in a very restrained way.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:50.020]   But that's not a lot of, but because we know
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.420]   we do go to war and there's all these things
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.900]   that interfere with it, including miscalculation
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.900]   and all of these human foibles,
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.340]   and several of those nuclear powers
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.540]   are not accountable leaders,
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.620]   I think we have to be a lot more worried
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.380]   than many of us were very recently.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.340]   I pointed out earlier, like the whole reason
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.340]   we're in this mess is because the only people
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.660]   who have this private interest in like having Ukraine
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.960]   give up its freedom is this Russian cabal and elite
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.500]   that gets their power and is preserved only
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.820]   and is threatened by Ukrainian democracy.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:25.700]   What would, how far would they go to hang on to power
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.020]   when push came to shove is I think the thing
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.560]   that worries me the most and is plainly
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.140]   what worries most people about the risk of nuclear war.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.780]   Like at what point does that unchecked leadership
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.900]   decide that this is worth it?
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.620]   Especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top.
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.460]   I don't know.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:51.380]   So, and I don't know that any of us
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.740]   have really fully thought through all of that calculus
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.100]   and what's going on.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.620]   Very recently around the anniversary of January 6th,
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.700]   there were a lot of questions about
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.860]   was the United States gonna have another civil war?
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.040]   On the one hand, I think it's almost unimaginable.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.780]   Sort of like in the same way I think that a nuclear war
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.300]   and a complete Armageddon is unimaginable.
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.800]   But I remember something that,
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:18.020]   when both of those questions get asked,
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.780]   I remember something, I was in the audience
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.340]   of listening to some great economists speak about
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.500]   the 20 years ago, but the risk of an Argentina style
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.040]   financial meltdown of the United States.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.940]   Like what's the total financial collapse?
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.100]   And they said, you know what?
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.200]   The risk is vanishingly small,
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.460]   but that's terrifying because until recently
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.360]   the answer was zero.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.180]   And so the fact that it's not zero
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:44.540]   should deeply, deeply scare us all.
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.100]   And we should devote a lot of energy
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.700]   to making it zero again.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.940]   And that's how I feel about the risk
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.940]   of a civil war in the US.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:53.500]   And that's how I feel about the risk of nuclear war.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.500]   It's higher than it used to be
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.420]   and that should terrify us all.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.780]   - To me what terrifies me is that all this kind of stuff
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.700]   seems to happen like overnight, like super quick
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.420]   and it escalates super quick when it happens.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.060]   So it's not like, I don't know.
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.340]   I don't know what I imagine, but it just happens.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:15.740]   Like if a nuclear war happened,
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.580]   it would be something like a plane,
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.540]   like in this case with Ukraine,
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:26.340]   a NATO plane shut down over some piece of land
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:32.060]   by the Russian forces or so the narrative would go,
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.900]   but it doesn't even matter what's true or not
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:38.900]   in order to spark the first moment of escalation.
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.620]   And then it just goes, goes, goes.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.100]   - Well, I think that happens sometimes.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:44.020]   I mean, again, it's this thing that,
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.700]   what social scientists call it,
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.060]   selection on the dependent variable.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.340]   Like there's all these times when that didn't happen,
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.180]   when it stopped, when it escalated one step
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.340]   and then people paused or escalated two steps
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:58.140]   and people said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:01.660]   And so we remember the times when it went boom, boom, boom,
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:02.500]   boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.900]   And then the really terrible thing happened.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.980]   But that, fortunately that's not,
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.420]   I start off the book with an example of a gang war
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.740]   that didn't happen in Medellin, Colombia,
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.180]   which is sort of, that's my day job
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:15.180]   is actually studying conflict and gangs and violence
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.740]   and of these other kinds of groups.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.140]   Also very sinister.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:23.460]   And most of the time they don't fight
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.980]   and that escalation doesn't happen.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.740]   So the escalation does happen quickly sometimes,
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.340]   except when it doesn't, which--
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.100]   - So we remember the ones when it does.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.380]   It's really important to think about all that.
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:39.700]   I remember talking to, I think Elon Musk on his podcast,
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.940]   I was sort of like talking about the horrors of war
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.340]   and so on.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.060]   And then he said, well, you know,
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.220]   like most of human history,
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:52.500]   'cause I think I said like most of human history
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:59.180]   had been defined by these horrible wars.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.140]   He's like, no, most of human history
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.340]   is just peaceful, like farming life.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:06.700]   We kind of remember the wars,
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.820]   but most of human history is just, you know, is life.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.460]   - Yeah, most of the competition between nations
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:16.900]   was like blood, I would say blood thirsty
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.980]   without drinking that blood
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:22.700]   in the sense that it was intense, it would loathe some.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.100]   And so a lot of the rivalry and a lot of the competition,
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:29.740]   which is also can be problematic in its own ways
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:30.860]   is not violent.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.940]   And most of human history is about the oppression
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.620]   of the majority by a few.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.300]   And there are moments when they rise up and revolt
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.060]   and there's a revolution, we remember those,
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.660]   but most of the time they don't.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:48.380]   And the story of political change and transformation
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.060]   and freedom is there's a few revolutions that are violent,
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:54.940]   but most of it is actually revolutions
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.420]   without that kind of violent revolt.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.540]   Most of it is just the peaceful concession of power
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.540]   by elites to a wider and wider group of people
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.380]   in response to their increased economic bargaining power,
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.420]   their threat that they're gonna march.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.580]   So even if we wanna understand something like
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:14.580]   the march of freedom over human history,
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.660]   I think we can draw the same insight
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.380]   that actually we don't, most of the time we don't fight,
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:23.020]   we actually concede power.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:25.860]   Now you don't, the elite doesn't sort of give power
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:29.020]   to the masses right away, they just co-opt the few merchants
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:31.220]   who could threaten the whole thing
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.380]   and bring them into the circle.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.100]   And then the circle gets a little bit wider
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.940]   and a little bit wider until the circle is ever widened,
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:41.340]   maybe not ever, but encompasses most, if not all.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:45.540]   And that's like a hopeful and optimistic trend.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:47.700]   - Yeah, if you look at the plot,
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.660]   if you guys could pull it up of the wars throughout history,
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.740]   this is the rate of wars throughout history
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.340]   just seem to be decreasing significantly
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:59.500]   with a few spikes and the sort of the expansion.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:04.540]   It's like half the world is under authoritarian regimes,
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:07.380]   but that's been shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.260]   - Steven Pinker's one person,
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.100]   one famous scholar who brings up this hypothesis.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.420]   I mean, there's sort of two ways,
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:15.500]   there's actually two separate kinds of violence,
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.700]   that one where I think he's completely right
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:21.300]   and one where I think we're not sure, maybe not.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.220]   Where he's completely right,
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:24.580]   sort of interpersonal violence, homicides,
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.980]   everyday violence has been going down, down,
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:27.980]   down, down, down, down, down.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:29.140]   That's just unambiguously.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.140]   And it's mostly because we've created cultures
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:35.700]   and states and rules and things that control that violence.
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.340]   Now the warfare between groups,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.740]   is that less frequent?
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:43.100]   Well, it's not clear that he's right,
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.940]   that there's fewer wars.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:49.180]   You might say that wars are more rare
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.900]   because they're more costly
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.100]   because our weapons are so brutal.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.660]   The costs of war go up, as the costs of war go up,
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.420]   not entirely, but for the most part,
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:00.460]   that gives us an understanding of not to have them.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.700]   But then when they do happen, they're doozies.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.260]   So is Pinker right?
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:06.100]   I hope he's right,
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.860]   but I don't think that officially that trend is there.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:13.860]   I think that we might have the same kind of levels
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:19.980]   of intergroup violence because maybe those five fundamentals
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:23.180]   that lead to war have not fundamentally changed
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:26.540]   and thus made us, given us a more peaceful world now
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:28.060]   than a couple hundred years ago.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.220]   - That's something to think about.
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.060]   So obviously looking at his hypothesis,
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.260]   looking at his data and others like him.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.900]   But I have noticed one thing,
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:38.220]   which is the amount of pushback he gets.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.220]   That there is this,
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.080]   this is speaking to the general point that you made,
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.500]   which is like we overemphasize the anecdotal,
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:51.460]   and don't look objectively at the aggregate data as much.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.940]   There's a general cynicism about the world.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:56.260]   And not, I don't even mean cynicism.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.740]   It's almost like cynicism porn or something like that,
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.820]   where people just get, for some reason,
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:05.660]   they get a little bit excited to talk about the destruction
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:09.660]   of human civilization in a weird way.
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:12.180]   Like they don't really mean it, I think.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:17.180]   If I were to like psychoanalyze their geopolitical analysis,
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.980]   is I don't, I think it's a kind of, I don't know,
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:24.700]   maybe it relieves the mind to think about death
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.300]   at a global scale somehow.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.300]   And then you can go have lunch with your kids afterwards
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.800]   and feel a little better about the world.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.980]   I don't know what it is.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.680]   But that, it's not very scientific.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.220]   It's very kind of personal, emotional.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.460]   And so we should be careful to look at the world
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:43.460]   in that way, 'cause if you look broadly,
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.560]   there is just like you highlight,
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   there's a will for peace among people, yeah.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.780]   You mentioned Medellin.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.140]   By the way, how do you pronounce it, Medellin or Medellin?
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:55.980]   - Both are fine.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:58.020]   I think the, there they say Medellin,
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.380]   because that's kind of the accent,
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.620]   is the zh on the double L.
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:05.660]   But Medellin would be totally fine as well.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:08.580]   - What lessons do you draw from the Medellin cartel,
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.460]   from the different gang wars in Colombia, Medellin?
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:15.180]   What's the economics of peace and war
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:17.180]   between drug cartels?
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:18.680]   - Here's what was really insightful for me.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:22.500]   So I live in Chicago, and people are aware
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.300]   that there's a violence problem in Chicago.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.660]   It's actually not the worst American city
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.720]   by any stretch of the imagination for shootings,
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   but it's pretty bad.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.560]   And Medellin has these better, many more,
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.560]   and probably many better organized gangs than Chicago.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.160]   And yet the homicide rate is maybe half.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.080]   And now, I mean, there have been moments
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.960]   when these gangs go to war in the last 30 years
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.960]   when Medellin has become the most violent place
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:53.800]   on the planet.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.340]   But for the most part right now, they're peaceful.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.900]   And so what's going on there?
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.600]   I mean, one thing that is,
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.880]   there's a hierarchy of organizations.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.080]   So that above these reasonably well-organized
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.200]   neighborhood gangs, there's a set of more shadowy
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.500]   organizations that have different names.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.800]   Some people call them "rezones."
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.960]   Some people would call them "bandas criminales,"
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.800]   criminal bands.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.520]   You might just call them "mafias."
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.000]   And they, there's about 17 of them,
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.560]   depending on how you want to count.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.280]   And they themselves have a little operating board
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.720]   called, sometimes they call it the "oficina."
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.920]   Sometimes they call it "la mesa," the table.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.080]   - Well, each individual one, or as a group?
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.440]   - As a group, as a group.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.560]   So they meet, and they don't meet personally all the time.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.920]   Sometimes they meet, but they consult.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.960]   A lot of the leaders of these groups are actually in prison.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.800]   And so, and they're in the same wings in prison.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.960]   - They have representatives, oh, they meet in prison.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.760]   - Well, they're, whatever, if I'm on a cell block with you,
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.320]   I'm meeting you anyways, right?
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.520]   So actually, imprisoning leaders and putting them
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.400]   in the same cell block, but not putting them in,
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.840]   if you get arrested here in the United States
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.960]   and you're a criminal leader,
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.360]   and you get put in a supermax prison,
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.800]   you cannot run your criminal empire.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.560]   It's just too difficult, it's impossible.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.040]   There, it's possible.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.760]   And you might think, and they do,
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.960]   they still run their empire.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.240]   And you might think that's a bad idea,
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.560]   but actually, cutting off the head
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.480]   of a criminal organization, leading it to a bunch,
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.200]   leaving it to a bunch of like hotheaded young guys
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.800]   who are disorganized is not always the path to peace.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.320]   So having these guys all in the same prison patios
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   is actually, it reduces imperfect information
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.880]   and uncertainty, right?
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.400]   It provides a place for them to bargain, they can talk.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.280]   And so La Oficina is like a lot of these informal meetings.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.820]   And so, you know, and they have these tools
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.440]   that they use to control the street gangs.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.000]   So instead of there being like 400 gangs,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.880]   all sort of in this anarchic situation
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.640]   of competing for territory and constantly at war,
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.480]   the Rezones are keeping them in line.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.800]   And they will use sanctions.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.400]   They will, where the sanction might be,
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.840]   I will put a bullet in your head if you don't--
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.680]   - It's a little more honest
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.720]   than the sanctions between nations.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.320]   - Exactly, but they will sit them down.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.920]   They'll provide, they'll help them negotiate.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.840]   They will provide, I said there are these things
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.880]   called commitment problems where like there's some,
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.560]   I have some incentive to like exterminate you,
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.060]   but that's gonna be costly for everybody.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.520]   So I'm gonna, what's the solution?
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.500]   I'm gonna provide commitment.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.600]   I'm gonna like enforce this deal.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.240]   And yeah, you don't like this deal now
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.840]   because you could take advantage of your situation
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   and wage war, but I'm gonna give you a counter-incentives.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.360]   And so they keep the peace.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.280]   And so, and it's a little bit,
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.680]   so they're a little bit like the UN Security Council
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.080]   and peacekeeping forces and sanctions regimes.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.360]   It's like the same kinds of tools, the same parallels.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.160]   And they're imperfect.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.520]   They don't always work that well.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.480]   And they're unequal, right?
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.000]   'Cause it's not like they're pursuing this
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.380]   in the interests of like democratic, blah, blah, blah.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:55.380]   But it kind of works until it doesn't.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.580]   And 10 years ago in the mid 1990s,
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.700]   there were wars and this breaks down.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.640]   And it kind of gave me this perspective
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.280]   on the international institutions
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.800]   and all the tools we've built,
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.420]   that we do the same things, right?
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.420]   Sanctions are designed to make unchecked leaders
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.060]   face the cost of war.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.500]   It's a solution to one of the five problems, right?
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:22.640]   And mediators are a solution to uncertainty.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.260]   And international institutions
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.780]   that can enforce a peace and agreement
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.540]   are a solution to commitment problems.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.220]   And all of these things can be solutions
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.300]   to these intangible incentives,
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.980]   like these preferences for whatever you value
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.560]   and miscalculations,
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.100]   because they will punish you for your miscalculation
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.660]   or they will get a mediator to sort of help you realize
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.740]   why you're miscalculating.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.260]   So they're doing all these things.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.820]   And it made me realize that the comparison
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.940]   to the UN Security Council and all our tools
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:49.780]   is actually a pretty good one
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:52.140]   'cause those are pretty unequal too.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.860]   And those are pretty imperfect.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.940]   Like there's these,
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.940]   we have five nations with a veto on the Security Council
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:00.820]   and a lot of unequal power
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:04.220]   and they're manipulating this in their own self-interest
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:05.800]   or their group's interests.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.380]   So anyway, so it's actually the,
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:12.500]   some of the things that work in Medellin
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.180]   and why they work help give me a lot of perspective
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.300]   on what works in the international arena
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.340]   and why we have some of the problems we have.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.180]   - So there's not,
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:23.780]   in some deep way there's not a fundamental difference
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:26.820]   between those 17 mafia groups and--
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:27.660]   - The UN Security Council.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.500]   - The UN Security Council.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.380]   (laughing)
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.700]   We're such funny descendant of apes.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.180]   We put on suits.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:36.580]   I'm sure they're wearing different,
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:39.580]   they have different cultural garbs that they wear.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.420]   What are your thoughts?
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.220]   I mean, that's the sense I got from Pablo Escobar
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.260]   and Jorge Ochoa who founded the Medellin cartel
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:50.580]   is like having spoken with people on this podcast,
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:53.940]   talked to Roger Reeves who was a drug transporter.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.440]   It seems like there, it seems like it was,
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.460]   I don't know the right term,
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.220]   but it was very kind of professional and calm.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.060]   It didn't have a sense of danger to it,
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.460]   like it's negotiating.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.940]   So like the danger is always on the table as a threat
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.240]   as part of the calculation,
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.140]   but you're using that threat in order to deescalate,
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.060]   in order to have peace.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.980]   Everybody is interested in peace.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.460]   - So something that happened last year,
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.380]   we were a little bit able to watch in real time
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:22.420]   'cause we had a few contacts.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:25.220]   We've been meeting and talking to a lot of these leaders
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:27.180]   in prison and a bit outside of prison.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.540]   Many of them will talk to us.
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:35.380]   And so, the homicide, I mentioned homicide rate
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:39.620]   in Medellin's maybe 2/3 or half of the Chicago level.
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.320]   It had been climbing.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.640]   Some of these street level gangs were starting to fight.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.340]   Maybe at sort of the, on some level,
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.800]   it seems that like maybe some of those
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.240]   Razon leaders were like saying,
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   "Well, you know, we're actually not sure
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.600]   "how strong these guys are.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.320]   "Let's let them fight just to test it out.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.400]   "Let's have these skirmishes."
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.040]   Right, it wasn't prolonged warfare.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.480]   It was like, "Let's just sort of feel out
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.260]   "how strong everybody is 'cause then we'll be able
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.920]   "to reapportion the drug corners and stuff accordingly."
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.280]   So they were kind of feeling each other out
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.680]   through fighting.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.280]   And the homicide rate doubled and then it increased
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.320]   by the same amount again.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.920]   And so it was approaching something
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.060]   that might get out of control,
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:19.440]   which wasn't in anybody's interest.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.440]   It wasn't in the government's interest,
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.360]   it wasn't in their interest.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.460]   And so then magically,
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:27.880]   all these leaders in these patios, right,
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.680]   different prisons, they're spread out
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.860]   around a bunch of prisons.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.680]   Everybody gets transferred to a new prison on the same day,
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.800]   which means they all get to be in the same holding area
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:40.240]   for three days before they're all moved elsewhere.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.720]   So the government had a role in this.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.040]   And then somebody who's like a trusted mediator
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.160]   on the criminal side gets himself arrested,
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.100]   happens to be put in the same spot.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:57.560]   And a week later, the homicide rate is 30% of what it was.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.600]   It's back to its normal, moderate,
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.660]   unfortunately not zero, right?
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.640]   But it's back to where it was
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.480]   because it didn't make sense to have a war.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.480]   And everybody, government, mafia leaders,
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.880]   everybody's sort of like,
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.440]   they figured out a way to sort of
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.740]   bargain their way to peace.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:20.600]   - Can I ask you something almost like a tangent,
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.420]   but you mentioned you got a chance potentially
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:24.800]   to talk to a few folks,
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.720]   some were in prison, some were not.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.480]   Is it productive?
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.720]   Is it interesting?
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.320]   Maybe by way of advice,
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.240]   do you have ideas about talking to people
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.320]   who are actively criminals?
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.920]   - Yeah.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.520]   It really depends on the situation.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:44.440]   So like the first time I worked in a conflicted place
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.600]   was in Northern Uganda,
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.120]   in maybe the last couple of years of a long running war.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.520]   So this would have been 2004, 2005.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.880]   This is a small East African country.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.360]   And the north of the country had been engulfed in,
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.240]   think of it as like a 20 year low level insurgency
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.120]   run by a self-proclaimed Messiah
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.720]   who wasn't that popular and no one joined his movement.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.220]   So he would kidnap kids.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:16.360]   And so I never,
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.880]   I could talk to people who'd come back from being there.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.040]   I never once, if I'd wanted to,
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.320]   and I was writing about that armed group.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.280]   I never talked to anybody who was an active member
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.680]   of that armed group, it was quite rare.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.680]   It wouldn't have been easy or safe.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.280]   And that's sometimes true.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.560]   I'm starting to do some work in Mexico probably,
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.000]   and I'm not gonna be talking to any criminal.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:37.840]   They'll kill people.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.320]   - When you say you're not going to talk to them
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.920]   and they'll kill people, which people?
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.920]   - So, I mean, journalists are routinely killed
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.880]   for knowing too much in Mexico.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:53.280]   There's no compunctions about killing them
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:55.240]   and there's no consequences.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.560]   - Who kills a journalist?
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.560]   It's not the main people that you spoke with, it's their,
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:07.160]   is it their lackeys or is it rival gangs?
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.240]   - This is true of a Chicago gang
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.440]   and this is true of a Medellin gang.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.920]   It's probably true of a Mexico gang.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.000]   It's like, you might have your group of 30 people.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.160]   One or two of them might be shooters.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.040]   Most people don't shoot.
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.560]   Most people don't like to do that.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.880]   Or you don't even have any of those people in your group
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.280]   because you're trying to run a business.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.240]   You don't need any shooters.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.560]   You can just hire a killer when you need them on contract.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.480]   And so if somebody's asking questions
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.480]   and you don't want them to ask questions
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.000]   or you think they know too much in a way that threatens you
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.160]   and it's cheap for you
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.600]   and you have no personal compunctions,
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.640]   then you can put a contract out on them
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.760]   and they'll be killed.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:51.920]   That doesn't happen in Colombia.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.720]   It doesn't happen in Chicago.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.280]   I don't know, there's lots of reasons for that.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.320]   I can't say exactly why.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.360]   I think one reason is like, they know what'll happen,
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.400]   is that there'll be consequences,
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.840]   that the government will crack down and make them pay
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.040]   and so they don't do it.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.360]   That's not what happened in Mexico.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.720]   They won't kill a DA agent.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.640]   They know that, the US has made it clear,
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.600]   you kill one of our agents, we will make you pay.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.400]   And so they're very careful to minimize
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.160]   death of American, but you kill journalists
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.560]   and nobody comes after them or is able to come after them.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.760]   And so they've realized they can get away with this
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.120]   and that seems to be the equilibrium there.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.680]   That's my initial sense from,
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.520]   but we spent a lot of time
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.160]   before we started talking to criminals.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.600]   We spent a year trying to figure out what was safe
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.440]   before we actually, and failing.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.960]   We kept, there are lots of safe things to do.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.160]   It was also really hard to figure out
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.160]   how to talk to people in these organizations
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.480]   and we failed 40 times before we figured out a way
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.800]   to actually access people.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.560]   - Is it worth it talking to them if you figure out,
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.080]   'cause it's not never gonna be safe.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.840]   It's going to be when you estimate
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.840]   that there's some low level of risk.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.360]   Like what's the benefit as a researcher,
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:10.920]   as a scholar of humans?
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   - Yeah, so I actually don't think,
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.240]   let's compare it to something,
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.680]   okay, I'm in Austin for the first time
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.920]   and I'm walking around and there's all these people
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.160]   buzzing around on these scooters without helmets.
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.240]   - We need to definitely interview them
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.800]   and say what the hell is wrong with you?
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.520]   - So nothing I have ever done in my entire career
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.480]   is as risky as that.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.160]   - That's a nice way to compare journalism in a war zone.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:39.520]   - Not well, yeah, there's some war zones.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.040]   I worked in Northern Uganda and I worked in Liberia
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:43.520]   and I work now in Medellin
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.560]   and I'm starting to work in Mexico
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.080]   and both those particular places
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.800]   and then the things I did in those places
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.360]   where I spent a lot of time making sure
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:55.480]   that what I was doing was not unduly risky.
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.080]   - Todd, could you pull up a picture
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.680]   of a person on a scooter in Austin
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.880]   so we can just compare this absurd situation
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.040]   where I doubt it's the riskiest thing
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.400]   'cause now we have to look at the data.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.760]   I understand the point you're making, but wow.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.400]   - So I'm not trying to say there's zero risk.
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.440]   I think there's like a calculated risk
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:16.120]   and I think you become good at,
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:20.000]   you work at becoming good at being able to assess
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.640]   these risks and know who can help you assess these risks.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:27.320]   - Yeah, I think there's another aspect to it too.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.920]   When you're riding a scooter,
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.080]   once you're done with the scooter,
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.280]   the risk has disappeared.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.160]   There's something, the lingering
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.960]   where you have to look over your shoulder,
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.400]   potentially for the rest of your life
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.760]   as you accumulate all of these conversations.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.800]   - Yeah, I've chosen, but I've also advised my students
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.160]   and I wouldn't go and do this with an armed group
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.080]   that would think I knew too much
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.360]   and therefore, some people do that.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.120]   Some journalists I think are very brave
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.440]   and take risks and do that and good for them
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.720]   and I'm happy they do that.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.800]   I don't personally do that.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:05.200]   So these guys are very, I mean,
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.240]   a medicinian is a business.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.440]   They're just, they're selling local drugs
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.840]   and they are laundering money for the big cartels
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.680]   and they are shaking down businesses for money
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.680]   or selling services in some cases
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.240]   and they make a lot of money, it's a business
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.240]   and they're in prison so they can talk about
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.120]   most of what they wanna talk about
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.560]   because there's no double jeopardy.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.920]   They've been incarcerated for it
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.800]   and you're just talking shop
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.240]   and they're just, you know,
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.520]   so it's worth it I think because the risk is very low
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:44.160]   but if you actually wanna weaken these organizations
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.600]   and they're extremely powerful,
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.800]   they're extremely big facet of life in a lot of cities
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.320]   in the Americas in particular,
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.080]   including in some of the United, some American cities,
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:58.320]   if you wanna understand how to weaken these groups over time
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.880]   you have to understand how their business works
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.720]   and we're like, imagine you were made like the,
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:08.120]   whatever the oil czars of the United States
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.880]   or maybe you're in charge of the finance industry, right?
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.520]   You're the regulator for oil and energy
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.560]   or for finance and then you get in the job
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.960]   and someone says, and then you're like,
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.280]   well, how many firms are there and what do they sell
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.160]   and what are the prices?
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.040]   And everyone's like, well, you know, we don't really know.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.560]   You would not be a very good regulator, right?
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.120]   And if you're a policeman or you're someone
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.680]   who's in charge of counter organized crime,
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:32.520]   you're just a regulator.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.360]   You're trying to regulate an illicit industry.
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.200]   You're regulating an industry that happens to be illicit
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.600]   and you have no information.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.120]   And so that's kind of what we do.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.400]   We figure out how the system works
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.160]   and like what are the economic incentives
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.520]   and what are the political incentives?
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.320]   - Any interviews and conversations help with that?
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.360]   - They help a lot, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.880]   We do that, so we have, I mean, I don't do,
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.400]   I do some of those, but I'm on the side,
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.600]   my Spanish is okay, it's not great and--
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.920]   - Do you have a translator usually if you ever go directly?
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.200]   - Well, if only because I can't understand
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.480]   the street vernacular, like I'm just totally hopeless.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.840]   Nor could many people who speak Spanish
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:09.960]   as a second language.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.920]   It's totally, you go to prison, you talk to these guys
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.920]   and they're speaking in the local dialect and it's tough.
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:19.280]   But more importantly, like I just don't need to be there.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.680]   And that's not my, I'm a quantitative scholar.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:23.560]   I'm the guy who collects the data.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.640]   So we have people, we have people on our team
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.600]   and colleagues and employees
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.120]   who are doing full-time interviews.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.080]   So, and then I just sometimes go with them, so.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.440]   - What about if we, you mentioned Uganda.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:36.880]   - Yeah.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.720]   - Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:42.920]   I'm seeing here he kidnapped 591 children
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.120]   in three years between 2000.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.920]   - They must have kidnapped.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:50.480]   I had, they probably kidnapped for at least a short time,
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:54.240]   like a few hours to a day, more than 50,000 kids.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.280]   - As a terror tactic?
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.160]   - A little bit, I mean, you know, most of those people,
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.760]   they just let go after they carried goods.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.120]   They held on to, they tried to hold on to thousands.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.360]   The short story, listen, if you're not popular,
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.120]   if you're running in our movement and you need troops,
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.240]   you can, and nobody wants to fight for you,
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.200]   you can either give up
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.360]   or you can have a small clandestine terror organization
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.280]   that tries to, a different set of tactics.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.880]   But if you want a conventional army
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.000]   and you don't want to give up, then you have to conscript.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.640]   And if you want to conscript and you don't,
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.400]   you know, here we conscript and then we say,
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.000]   if you run away, we'll shoot you.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.440]   And we control the whole territory.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.080]   So we'll, that's a credible promise.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.000]   If you're a small insurgency organization,
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.080]   people can run away and then you can't promise
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.000]   to shoot them very easily
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.880]   because you don't control all the territory.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.400]   And so what these movements do is they try to brainwash you.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.720]   And I think what they figured out
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.400]   after years of abducting children, you know,
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.360]   you talk about evil, they figured out that, you know,
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.080]   we have to maybe like, I don't know what the,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.200]   but say like maybe one in a hundred
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.280]   will like buy the rhetoric.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.680]   So we just have to conscript or abduct
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.000]   large number of kids.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.720]   And then some small number of them will not run away.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.960]   And those will be our committed cadres.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:11.200]   And those people can become commanders.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:12.920]   And because they'll buy the propaganda
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.760]   and they'll buy the messianic messages.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.120]   But because most people wise up,
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:19.800]   we have to, especially as they get older,
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.480]   we just have to abduct vast numbers of kids
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.720]   in order to have a committed cadre.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:27.840]   And so it has the other benefit of sort of being terrifying
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.560]   for the population and being a weapon in itself.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:33.280]   But I think it was for them was just primarily
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.840]   a way to solve a recruitment problem
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.840]   when you're a totally like hopeless
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.800]   and ideologically empty rebel movement.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.520]   So in some sense it's, yeah,
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.520]   so that's maybe the short story.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.440]   It was a real tragedy.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:55.840]   - I heard one interview of a dictator
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:00.560]   where the journalist was basically telling them,
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.600]   like, how could you be doing this?
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.240]   Basically calling out all the atrocities
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:09.000]   the person is committing.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.120]   And the dictator was kind of laughing it off
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.480]   and walked away.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.960]   And like he cut off the interview.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.200]   That feel like a very unproductive thing to be doing.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.560]   You're basically stating the thing
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.040]   that everyone knows to his face.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.760]   Maybe that's pleasant to somebody,
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.960]   but that feels unproductive.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:28.040]   It feels like the goal should be
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.680]   some level of understanding.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:30.520]   - Yeah.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.680]   He's been super elusive.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.440]   - Is it Kony?
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:36.760]   - It's Kony, yeah.
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:39.640]   I mean, why he's fought this, I don't even know.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.400]   It's not a great example of,
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.280]   that's an, you know what,
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.240]   the way I look at that situation is,
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.240]   it's a little bit particular to the way Uganda works,
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.800]   but most of the political leadership
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:58.000]   for most of its post-independence history
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.200]   came from the north of the country.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.800]   That was like the power base.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.640]   And that was dictatorial.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:05.480]   And they were,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.120]   so you've heard of like people like Idi Amin,
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:08.920]   but people have heard of like Milton Abote,
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:11.120]   and all these people were all from the north.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.200]   And then you get the current president
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.880]   who came to power in 1986.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.160]   So he's been around a long time,
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.000]   this guy in the 70s.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.680]   He was from the south.
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.160]   And he was fighting against these dictators,
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.320]   and he was fighting for a freer and better Uganda.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.080]   And in many ways, I mean, he's still a dictator himself,
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:33.040]   but he did create a freer and better Uganda.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.920]   So he's better than these,
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.160]   he's a thug, but he was better than thugs before him.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:41.000]   And he came to power, and he was like,
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.240]   and these, some of the northerners were like,
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.160]   we wanna keep up the fight.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:48.000]   And he was like, you know what, you guys,
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.880]   I'm strong enough to contain you to the north.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.480]   You guys go, you wanna have a crazy insurgency up there,
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:58.480]   and some kook believes he's like speaking,
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.960]   you know, through the Holy Spirit,
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.760]   you know, speaking through him,
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:05.400]   and he's gonna totally disrupt the north.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.000]   I don't care, that's great.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.360]   You guys just fester and fight,
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:13.560]   and that's gonna totally destabilize this power,
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.240]   this traditional power base,
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.440]   and then that's just gonna help me consolidate control.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.040]   So he was an autocrat, he was an unchecked leader
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:25.040]   who allowed a lunatic to run around and cause mayhem
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:30.320]   because it was in his political interest to do so.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.280]   And there's no puzzle.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:40.080]   In some ways, it's that simple and kind of tragic.
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:42.120]   - There's little to understand.
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.560]   - Yeah, it took me a lot, well, you know what,
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.440]   it's not so easy.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:47.080]   In the middle of it, I didn't understand that.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.680]   I don't think a lot of people did,
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:51.520]   and I'm not, I think I could persuade most people
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.600]   who study or work there now to like see it that way.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.200]   I think people, that would make sense to people,
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.680]   but it didn't make sense in the moment.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.160]   And you know, in the moment, this is happening,
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.280]   it's terrible, and you kind of, you know,
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.840]   you don't realize how avoidable it was.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:06.920]   That basically, it was the absence
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.400]   of effective police actions
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.960]   that kept the lunatic from being contained.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.760]   And that lunatic would never, you know,
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:17.520]   he's not, it's not that skillful of our movement, right?
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.520]   They could have, it could have been shut down,
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.760]   and there was just never any political will
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.160]   to shut it down.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.360]   The opposite, that's what I meant,
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.320]   like that unchecked leader,
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.600]   not only do you not pay the cost,
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:28.880]   but you might have a private incentive as an autocrat
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.400]   to like see that violence happen.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.800]   And in this case, it was just keeping
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:35.440]   a troublesome part of the country busy.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:38.160]   - If it's okay to look at a few other wars,
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:41.040]   so we talked about drug wars and Medellin.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:44.240]   Are there other wars that stand out to you
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.200]   as full of lessons?
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.440]   We can jump around a little bit.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:49.600]   Maybe if we can return briefly at World War II,
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:55.160]   from your framework, could World War II have been avoided?
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.160]   This, this one of the most traumatic wars, global wars.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:05.680]   - I mean, one obvious driver of that war was these,
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:10.160]   the things that Hitler valued,
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.040]   and then was able to use his autocratic power
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:20.000]   to either convince other people or to suppress them.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.080]   And so some people stop there and say that,
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.560]   and then in the West, basically,
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.680]   and then of course they were able,
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.560]   because they were such an economic and political powerhouse,
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.040]   they were able to sort of make demands
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:39.040]   of the rest of Europe that you can kind of see the full,
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:42.080]   letting Nazis march into Denmark without a fight,
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.480]   or France folding very quickly,
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.520]   you can kind of see as like an appeasement
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:49.280]   or an acknowledgement of their superiority
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:52.960]   and their ability to bargain without much of a fight.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:55.520]   And then you can see the Western response
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.400]   as a principled stand.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:59.320]   I think that's, and there's a lot of truth to that.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.440]   In terms of the strategic forces,
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:04.120]   a lot of political scientists see a version
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.000]   of a commitment problem, basically where Germany says,
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.680]   you know what, we're strong now, we're temporarily strong,
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.640]   we're not gonna be this strong forever.
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:17.760]   If we can get this terrible bargain
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:22.040]   and get everyone to capitulate through violence,
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:25.680]   if we strike now and then solidify our power
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:28.480]   and keep these, in World War I,
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.120]   it was prevent the rise of Russia
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:37.360]   and prevent the strengthening of Russian alliances as well.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.560]   And so we have an incentive to strike now,
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.680]   and there's a window of opportunity that's closing
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.240]   and that they thought was closing
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:48.480]   as soon as 1917 in World War I.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:50.280]   And I don't know that that story
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.920]   is as persuasive in World War II.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.080]   I think there was an element of a closing window.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:56.400]   - They kept talking about a closing window.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.600]   They really thought there was a closing window.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.800]   I think it was a nature of that window is different
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.960]   in that there was a kind of pacifism.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:10.360]   And it seems like if war broke out,
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:13.960]   most nations in the vicinity would not be ready.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.800]   You could buy the people, the leaders that are in power,
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:20.680]   they weren't ready, so the timing is really right now.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.240]   But I wonder how often that is the case
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.760]   with leaders in war, it feels like the timing is now.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.160]   - The other commitment problem,
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:30.160]   the other shift that was happening that he wanted to avert
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.280]   that is kind of wrapped up with his ideology
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:35.000]   is this idea of a cultural
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.720]   and a demographic window of opportunity.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.240]   That if he wanted, conditional on having these views
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.560]   of a Germanic people and a pure race,
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.040]   and that now is, he had to strike now
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:53.920]   before any opportunity to sort of establish
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:54.920]   that was possible.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.200]   I think that's one, it's an incentive
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.720]   that requires his ideology as well.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:03.960]   - How do, so to avoid it within this framework,
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.400]   would you say, is there,
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:11.600]   that you kind of provide an explanation,
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:13.160]   but is there a way to avoid it?
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.200]   Is violence the way to avoid it?
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:17.320]   Because people kind of tried rational,
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:22.160]   peaceful kind of usual negotiation,
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:23.720]   and that led to this war.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.480]   Is that unique to this particular,
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.640]   let's say World War I or World War II?
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:31.320]   So there's an extra pressure from Germany
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.640]   on both wars to act, okay?
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.560]   So we've highlighted that.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:37.720]   Is there a way to alleviate that extra pressure to act?
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:39.960]   - Let me use World War I as an example.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.320]   Suppose as many German generals said at that time,
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:46.520]   we have a window of opportunity before Russia
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.600]   where we might not win a war with Russia.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:52.000]   Like, so the probability that we can win a war
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.440]   is gonna change a lot in the next decade or two,
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.800]   maybe even in the next few years.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:00.840]   And so if we are in a much better bargaining position now,
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:02.640]   both to not use violence, but to,
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.160]   if necessarily use violence.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.000]   Because otherwise,
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.240]   Russia's going to be extremely powerful in the future,
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.720]   and they'll be able to use that power
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.160]   to change the bargaining with us,
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.960]   and to like hold, keep us down.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.840]   And the thing is, is in principle,
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:19.920]   Russia could say, look,
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:21.760]   we don't wanna get invaded right now.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:24.240]   We know you could invade us.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.080]   We know we're weak.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.640]   We know we'll be strong in the future.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:31.640]   We promise to like not wield our and abuse our,
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:35.800]   or just merely just sort of take what we can get
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:37.120]   in the future when we're strong.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.280]   We're gonna restrain ourselves in future.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.640]   Or we're gonna hand over something that makes us powerful
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.080]   because that's the bargain
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:44.720]   that would make us all better off.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.920]   And the reason political economists
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.080]   call it a commitment problem
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.280]   is because that's a commitment that would solve the problem.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.680]   And they can't make that commitment
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.040]   'cause there's nobody who will hold them accountable.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:59.240]   So anything, any international legal architecture,
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.160]   any set of enforceable agreements,
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.480]   any UN Security Council, any world government,
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.080]   anything that would help you make that commitment
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.840]   is a solution, all right, if that's the core problem.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:14.400]   And so that's why in Medellin,
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:20.040]   La Oficina can do that.
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:21.920]   They can say, listen, yes,
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.800]   combo that's strong today is gonna be weak tomorrow.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:27.080]   You have an incentive to eliminate this combo over here,
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.600]   but because they're gonna be strong, but guess what?
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.680]   You're not gonna do that.
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:31.840]   And we're gonna make sure,
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.680]   we're gonna promise that when these guys do get strong,
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.800]   we're gonna restrain what they can do.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:39.920]   I mean, most of our constitutions in most stable countries
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:42.000]   have done precisely that, right?
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.120]   There's a lot of complaining right now in the United States
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:46.080]   about the way that the constitution
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.080]   is a portion power between states.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:52.240]   That was a deal, that was a commitment.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:55.280]   The constitution in the United States was a deal
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.840]   made to a bunch of states
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.040]   that knew they were going to be weak in future
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.400]   because of economic and demographic trends,
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.400]   or guess they might be.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.520]   And it said, listen, you cooperate
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:09.520]   and we'll commit not to basically ignore your interests
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.600]   over the long run.
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:14.880]   And now, 250 years later,
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:17.560]   we're still honoring those commitments.
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:21.720]   It was part of the deal that meant
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.960]   that there actually would be a union.
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.200]   And so we do this all the time.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.600]   So constitution is a good example of how
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.240]   every country's constitution,
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:33.120]   especially a country who's writing a constitution
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.840]   after a war, that constitution
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.440]   and all of the other institutions they're building
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:40.280]   are an attempt to like provide commitment
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:42.640]   to groups who are worried about future shifts in power.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:45.800]   - And then does that help with avoid civil war?
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:50.800]   So could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars,
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:53.160]   the American civil war and the others?
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:58.160]   - So Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:02.640]   for a long time to preserve the interests
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:05.680]   of minority groups, powerful minority groups
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:08.040]   who were powerful at the time
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.680]   and knew that the demographics were working against them
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:12.680]   were to guarantee, you know,
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.920]   this ethnic religious group gets the presidency
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:17.000]   and this ethnic religious group
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.920]   gets the prime ministership and this ethnic,
[02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:23.360]   and a lot of countries will apportion seats
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:26.840]   in the parliament to ethnic religious groups.
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:31.680]   And that's an attempt to like give a group
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:35.920]   that's temporarily powerful some assurances
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:38.160]   that when they're weak in the future,
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:40.200]   that they'll still have a say, right?
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.680]   Just like we portioned seats in the Senate
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:45.480]   in a way that's not demographically representative
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:47.820]   but is like unequal, quote unquote, in a sense
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.440]   to help people be confident
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.120]   that there won't be a tyranny of the majority.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.800]   And now that just happens to have been
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.040]   like a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.680]   because eventually like the de facto power on the ground
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:04.200]   just gets so out of line with this really rigid system
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.960]   of the presidency goes to this ethnic religious group
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.640]   and this prime ministership goes,
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:10.040]   that it didn't last, right?
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.360]   So, but you can think of every post-conflict agreement
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:16.800]   and every constitution is like a little bit of,
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:22.700]   humans best effort to find an agreement
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:27.620]   that's going to protect the interests of a group
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:31.200]   that's temporarily has an interest in violence
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:35.220]   in order to not be violent.
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:36.180]   - Yeah.
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:38.340]   - And so there's a lot of ingenuity
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:40.900]   and it doesn't always work, right?
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:43.860]   - Which actually from a perspective of the group,
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:46.540]   threatening violence or actually doing violence
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.620]   is one way to make progress for your group.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:51.540]   - We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right?
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.780]   We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:54.980]   or Russians versus the West,
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:57.820]   or maybe it's managing gangs versus one another.
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:01.020]   Like a lot of their bargaining power
[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:03.840]   comes from their ability to burn the house down, right?
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.060]   And so if I wanna have more bargaining power,
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:09.020]   I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence.
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:13.260]   And so the strategically wise thing to do,
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:14.100]   I mean, it's terrible.
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.540]   It's a terrible equilibrium for us to be forced into,
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:17.980]   but the strategically wise thing to do
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:20.860]   is to build up lots of arms, to threaten to use them,
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.060]   to credibly threaten to use them,
[02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:25.020]   but then trust or hope that like your enemy
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:30.020]   is gonna see reason and avoid this really terrible,
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:33.620]   inefficient thing, which is fighting.
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:35.340]   But the thing that's going on the whole time
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:37.980]   is both of you arming and spending like 20% of GDP
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:40.820]   or whatever on arms, that's pretty inefficient.
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:41.740]   - Yes.
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:43.620]   - That's the tragedy.
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.420]   We don't have war and that's good,
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:48.140]   but we have really limited abilities
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:51.060]   to like incentivize our enemies not to arm
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:52.420]   and to keep ourselves from arming.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:56.300]   We'd love to agree to just like both disarm, but we can't.
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:59.540]   And so the mess is that we have to arm
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:01.180]   and then we have to threaten all the time.
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:04.780]   - Yeah, so the threat of violence is costly nevertheless.
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:07.340]   You've actually pulled up that now disappeared,
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:11.500]   a paper that said the big title called "Civil War"
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:13.100]   and your name is on it.
[02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:15.140]   What's that about?
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:17.100]   - Well, that was, I mean, when I was finishing
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:19.620]   graduate school and this is a paper with my advisor
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:22.260]   at Ted Miguel at Berkeley.
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:24.980]   - Most nations, the paper opens,
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:29.260]   have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:32.540]   Yet while, were you still in grad school on this or no?
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.380]   - Maybe last year or just graduated, I think.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:38.580]   - I wish I was in a discipline that wrote papers like this.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:40.060]   This is pretty badass.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:42.920]   Yet while civil war is central to many nations
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.920]   development, it has stood at the periphery
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.980]   of economic research and teaching, so on and so forth.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:53.740]   And this is looking at civil war broadly throughout history
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:55.540]   or is it just particular civil wars?
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.780]   - We were mostly looking at like the late 20th century.
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:00.220]   I mean, I was trained as a, what's called
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:02.300]   development economist, which is somebody who studies
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:05.100]   why some places are poor and why some countries are rich.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:10.140]   And I, like a number of people around that time,
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:11.740]   stumbled into violence.
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:14.000]   I mean, people have been studying the wealth
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.980]   and poverty of nations basically since the invention
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:20.980]   of economics, but there was a big blind spot for violence.
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:26.320]   Now there isn't any more, it's like a flourishing area
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.920]   of study, but in economics, but at the time it wasn't.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:32.080]   And so there were people like me and Ted
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:35.480]   who were sort of part political scientists,
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.120]   'cause political scientists obviously had been
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.480]   studying this for a long time, who started bringing
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:42.920]   economic tools and expertise and like partnerships
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:45.000]   with political scientists and adding to it.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.220]   And so we wrote this, so after like people had been doing
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:50.760]   this for five or 10 years in our field, we wrote
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:53.440]   like a review article telling economists
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.360]   like what was going on.
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.080]   And so this was like a summary for economists.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:58.640]   So the book in some ways is a lot in the same spirit
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:04:59.920]   of this article.
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:03.600]   This article, I mean, it's designed to be not written
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.400]   as like a boring laundry list of studies,
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:08.000]   which is what, that's the purpose this article was for.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.680]   It was for graduate students and professors
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:11.560]   who wanted to think about what to work on
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.200]   and what we knew.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.640]   This book is like now trying to like, not just say
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.640]   what economists are doing, but sort of say
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.520]   what economists, political scientists, psychologists,
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:23.440]   sociologists, anthropologists, like how do we bring
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.680]   some sense to this big project and policy makers?
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:27.520]   Like, what do we know?
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:30.060]   And what do we know about building peace?
[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:33.280]   Given, you know, because if you don't know what the reason
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:35.280]   for wars are, you're probably not gonna design
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.220]   the right cure.
[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:40.580]   And so anyway, so that was the, but I started off
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:43.940]   studying civil wars and I, because I stumbled into
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:46.020]   this place in Northern Uganda basically by accident.
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.860]   It was a never, no intention of working in civil wars.
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:49.940]   I'd never thought about it.
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:54.940]   And then, you know, basically I followed a woman there.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:59.580]   - And we'll talk about that.
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:00.660]   I gotta ask you first.
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:02.380]   And for people who are just watching,
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:05.460]   we have an amazing team of folks helping out
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:08.420]   pulling pictures and articles and so on,
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:11.100]   mostly so that I can pull up pictures on Instagram
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:13.580]   of animals fighting, which is what I do on my own time.
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:15.340]   And then we could discuss, analyze,
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:16.540]   maybe with George St. Pierre.
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:20.020]   That's what all he sends me for people who are curious.
[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:21.900]   But let me ask you, one of the most difficult things
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:24.520]   going on in the world today, Israel-Palestine.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:28.620]   Will we ever see peace in this part of the world?
[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:33.620]   And sort of your book title is "The Roots of War
[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:37.860]   and the Paths for Peace" or the subtitle, "Why We Fight."
[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:41.460]   What's the path for peace?
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.820]   Will we ever see peace?
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:47.820]   - Yeah, if we think about this conflict in the sense
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:51.060]   of like this dispute, this sort of contest,
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.940]   this contest that's been going on between Israelis
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:56.020]   and Palestinians, it's been going on for a century.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:07:01.020]   And there were really just 10 or 15 years
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:05.580]   of pretty serious violence in that span of time.
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:10.060]   Most of it from 2000 to 2009 and stretching up to 2014.
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:12.660]   There are sporadic incidents which are really terrible.
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:14.460]   I'm not trying to diminish the human cost of these,
[02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.020]   by the way, I'm just trying to point out
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:19.860]   that whatever's happening, as unpleasant and challenging
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:21.940]   and difficult as it is, it's actually not war.
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:22.980]   And so it is at peace.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:24.420]   There's sort of an uneasy stalemate.
[02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:26.260]   Israelis and Palestinians are actually pretty good
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:28.340]   at just sort of keeping this at a relatively low scale
[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:29.320]   of violence.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:33.340]   There's a whole bunch of like low scale sporadic violence
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:36.720]   that can be repression of civilians.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:40.540]   It can be terror bombings and terror actions.
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:42.940]   It can be counter-terror violence.
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:44.900]   It can be mass arrests.
[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:45.740]   It can be repression.
[02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:47.140]   It can be denying people the vote.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:51.020]   It can be rattling sabers, all these things
[02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:52.940]   that are happening, right?
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:56.100]   And it can be sporadic three-week wars
[02:07:56.100 --> 02:08:00.920]   or sporadic, very brief episodes of intense violence
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:03.740]   before everybody sees sense and then settles down
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:07.060]   to this uneasy, that's not like,
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.500]   we're right not to think of that as like a peace
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:11.620]   and there's certainly no stable agreement, right?
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:15.180]   So a stable agreement and amity and any ability
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:18.680]   to move on from this extreme hostility,
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:22.640]   we're not there yet and that's maybe very far away.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.760]   But this is a good example of two rivals
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:29.760]   who most of the time have avoided really intense violence.
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:34.760]   - So you talked about this, like most of the time,
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:38.080]   rivals just like avoiding violence
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.840]   and hating each other in peace.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:44.320]   So is this what peace, so to answer my question--
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.160]   - Yeah, sometimes.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:46.520]   - Is this what peace looks like?
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:50.120]   - Not always, but I mean, it's kind of my worry
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.720]   to go back to like the Russia-Ukraine example,
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:55.960]   like I kind of, it's gonna be really hard
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:00.560]   to find an agreement that both sides can feel
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:03.000]   they can honor, that they can be explicit about,
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.120]   that they'll hold to, that will enable them to move on.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:09.120]   - Yeah, feels like a first step in a long journey
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.520]   towards a greatness for both nations
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:15.320]   and a peaceful time, flourishing, that kind of thing.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:18.040]   - I mean, you can think of like what's going on
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:20.620]   in Israel-Palestine, there's a stalemate.
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:24.980]   Both of them are exhausted from the violence
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:28.220]   that has occurred, neither one of them is quite willing to,
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:31.380]   for various reasons, to create this sort of stable agreement.
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:34.340]   There's a lot of really difficult issues to resolve.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:39.180]   And maybe the sad thing, maybe we'll end up
[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:41.020]   in the same situation with Russia-Ukraine.
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:44.180]   This is where, you know, if they stop fighting one another,
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:47.260]   but Russia holds the east of the country and Crimea
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:50.660]   and nobody really acknowledges their right to that,
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:53.580]   that might, and there's just gonna be a lot of tension
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:56.100]   and skirmishing and violence, but that never really
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:59.260]   progresses to war for 30 years, that would be a sad,
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:02.180]   but maybe possible outcome.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:06.140]   So that's kind of where Israel-Palestine looks to me.
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:08.960]   And so someone, if we're gonna talk about why we fight,
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:11.260]   then the question we have to ask is like, why,
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:14.140]   you know, like the second Intifada,
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:15.520]   like that was the most violent episode.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.740]   Like, why did that happen and why did that last
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:19.820]   several years?
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:21.940]   That would be like, we could analyze that
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:23.980]   and we could say, what was it about these periods
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:27.060]   of violence that led there to be prolonged intense violence?
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:28.380]   Because that was in nobody's interest,
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:29.620]   that didn't need to happen.
[02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:32.340]   And partly I don't talk about that in the book.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:35.260]   I wanted to avoid really contemporary conflicts
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:36.780]   for two reasons.
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:40.220]   One is things could change really quickly.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.260]   I didn't want the book to be dated.
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:43.220]   I wanted this to be a book that had like longevity
[02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:47.040]   and that would be relevant still in 10 years
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:50.260]   or 20 years maybe before someone writes a better one.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:52.380]   - Or before the human civilization ends.
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:53.420]   - Exactly.
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:55.100]   And circumstances can change really quickly.
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.580]   So I wanted it to be enduring and meant partly
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.980]   just avoiding changing things and changing these
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:01.460]   and avoiding these controversial ones.
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:02.900]   But of course I think about them.
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:05.500]   And so like a lot of my time, I decided actually
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.820]   last year to teach a class where I'd take all
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:10.960]   these contemporary conflicts that wasn't working
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:12.540]   on the book and where I wasn't really an expert,
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:15.700]   whether it's India, Pakistan, China, Taiwan,
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:19.620]   Israel, Palestine, Mexican cartel state drug wars,
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:23.940]   and a few others, and then teach a class on them
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:25.180]   with students and we'd work through it.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.940]   We'd read the book and then we'd say,
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:28.140]   all right, none of us are experts.
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:30.180]   How do we make sense of these places?
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:32.100]   And we focused in the Israel-Palestine case
[02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:34.980]   of mostly trying to understand why it got so violent
[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:38.420]   and then spend a little bit of time on what the prospects
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:41.340]   are for something that's more enduring.
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.660]   - It's hard to know that stuff now.
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:45.140]   I mean, it's easier to do the full analysis
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:48.380]   when looking back when it's over.
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.360]   - Well, Israel is in like a tough place.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:52.620]   They have this attachment to being part of the West.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:54.460]   They have this attachment to liberal ideals.
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.660]   They have an attachment to democracy
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:58.960]   and they have an attachment to a Jewish state.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.420]   And those things are not so easily compatible
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:09.700]   because to recognize the rights of non-Jewish citizens
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:15.700]   or to have a one state solution to the current conflict
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:21.580]   undermines the long-term ability to have a Jewish state.
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:26.740]   And to do anything else and to deny that
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:32.740]   denies their liberal democratic ideals.
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:39.300]   And that's a really hard contest of freedom
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:42.580]   of priorities to sort out.
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:43.420]   - Yeah, it's complicated.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:44.400]   Of course, everything you just said
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:47.700]   probably has multiple perspectives on it from other
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:49.700]   that would phrase all the same things
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:51.540]   but using different words.
[02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:53.540]   - Well, I try to analyze these things
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:54.940]   in like a dispassionate way.
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.820]   - But unfortunately, just having made enough conversations,
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:02.340]   even your dispassionate description would be seen
[02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:06.300]   as one that's already picked aside.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:10.780]   And I'll say this because there's holding these ideals.
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.060]   I'll give you another example.
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:15.940]   United States also has ideals of freedom
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:19.060]   and other like human rights.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.540]   So it has those ideals and it also sees itself
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:27.420]   as a superpower and as a deployer of those,
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:30.220]   enforcer of those ideas in the world.
[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:32.580]   And so the kind of actions from a perspective
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:34.420]   of a lot of people in that world,
[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:37.700]   from children, they get to see drones drop bombs
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:42.660]   on their house where their father is now, mother are dead.
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:45.340]   They have a very different view of this.
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:47.140]   - Well, you're beginning to see why I didn't,
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:49.780]   I decided I wanted to write about those things
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:50.780]   and think about those things,
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:54.300]   but I wanted this book to do something different.
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:57.380]   And I didn't want it to fall on one of these polarizations.
[02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:59.220]   On a personal level, because I think I'm kind
[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:02.820]   of a liberal democratic person at heart,
[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:05.260]   my sympathies in that sense lie in many ways
[02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:07.460]   with the Palestinians, despite the way I,
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:10.620]   I mean, I'm just the fact that people are,
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:12.860]   they're not representative and they, you know,
[02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:17.500]   and they got a very raw, real politic kind of deal.
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:19.900]   Like most people in history have gotten like this raw,
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:21.820]   real politic kind of deal in their past, right?
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:22.660]   Where somebody took something from.
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:24.900]   - It's a good summer of history, by the way.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:27.780]   - That's it, history is just full of raw deals.
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:28.820]   - For regular people.
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:33.820]   - Right, and both sides are in a principled way
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:37.820]   refusing to make the compromise.
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:40.420]   And that's not like a both sides are right kind of argument.
[02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:43.100]   I'm just sort of saying, I just think it's a factual
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:46.540]   statement that like, neither one wants to compromise
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:50.580]   on certain principles and they're both,
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:54.140]   they both can construct and in some ways have very reasonable
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:56.140]   but I don't want to have self-justifications
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:56.980]   for those principles.
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:14:59.020]   And that's why I'm not very hopeful as I'm,
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:04.020]   I don't see a way and to, for them to resolve those things.
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:06.660]   - Speaking of compromise and war,
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:09.220]   let me ask you about one last one,
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:13.060]   which may be in the future, China and the United States.
[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:14.340]   - Yeah.
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:18.380]   - How do we avoid an all out hot war
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:22.300]   with this other superpower in the next decade,
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:24.140]   50 years, a hundred years?
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:27.780]   Because sometimes when it's quiet at night,
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:31.420]   I can hear in the long distance, the drums of war beating.
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:32.260]   - Yeah.
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:34.100]   You know, in the second part of the book,
[02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:36.220]   I talk about what I think have been like these persistent,
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:37.060]   like paths to peace.
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:39.020]   And one of them is increasing interdependence
[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:40.260]   and interrelationships.
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:43.660]   And another one is more checks and balances on power.
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:46.620]   I think there's more, but those are two
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:47.860]   that are really fundamental here,
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:51.220]   because I think those two things reduce the incentives
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:52.060]   for war in two ways.
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:54.100]   One is like, remember when we were talking
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:55.700]   about this really simple strategic game
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:59.460]   where I, whether I'm Russia and Ukraine or whatever,
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:03.780]   any two rivals, I want more of the pie than you get.
[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:08.340]   And the costs of war are deterrence,
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:11.900]   but only the costs of war that I feel, right?
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:12.740]   I don't care.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:15.740]   I do not care about the costs of war to your side,
[02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:16.580]   my rival's side.
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:17.420]   I'm not even thinking of that.
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:18.420]   That's just worth zero to me.
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.620]   I just don't care in that simple game.
[02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:24.620]   Now, in reality, many groups do care
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:25.940]   about the wellbeing of the other group,
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:27.300]   at least a little bit, right?
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:29.620]   We are in some sense to the degree we,
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:31.940]   first of all, if our interests are intertwined,
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:33.700]   like our economies are intertwined,
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:39.580]   that's not a surefire way for peace.
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:40.900]   And we shouldn't get complacent
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.420]   'cause we have a globally integrated world,
[02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:44.260]   but that's gonna be a disincentive.
[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:45.500]   And if we're socially entwined
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:47.180]   because we have great social relationships
[02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:49.980]   and linkages and family, or we're intermarriage
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:53.860]   or whatever, all these things will help.
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:56.020]   And then if we're ideologically intertwined,
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:58.460]   maybe we share notions of liberty,
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:00.700]   or maybe we just share a common notion of humanity.
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:02.660]   So I think the fact that we're more integrated
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:05.500]   than we've ever been on all three fronts in the world,
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:10.180]   but with China is providing some insulation, which is good.
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:13.300]   So I would be more worried if we started to shed
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:14.660]   some of that insulation,
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:17.580]   which I think has been happening a little bit.
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:19.660]   US economic nationalism,
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:24.300]   whatever could be the fallout of these sanctions
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:26.780]   or a closer Chinese alliance with Russia,
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:28.140]   all those things could happen.
[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:29.820]   Those would make me more worried
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:31.460]   because I think we've got a lot of cushion
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:34.860]   that comes from all of this economic, social,
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:36.380]   cultural interdependence.
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:39.060]   - Yeah, the social one with the internet is a big one.
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:41.140]   So basically make friends
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:43.780]   with the people from different nations,
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.820]   fall in love, or you don't have to fall in love,
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:49.540]   you can just have lots of sex with people from different
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:51.460]   nations, but also fall in love.
[02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:53.700]   - The thing that also comforts me about China
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:57.060]   is that China's not as centralized
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:00.660]   or as personalized a regime as Russia, for example,
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:02.980]   and neither one of them is as centralized or personalized
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:07.380]   as some tin pot, purely personalized dictatorship,
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:09.220]   like you get in some countries.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:13.260]   The fact that China, the power is much more widely shared
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:17.380]   is a big insulation, I think, against this war,
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:18.760]   well, future war.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:26.700]   The attempts by Xi Jinping to personalize power over time
[02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:29.020]   and to make China a more centralized
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.740]   and personal ruled place,
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:34.380]   which he's successfully moved in that direction,
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:35.740]   also worries me.
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:38.980]   So anything that moves China in the other direction,
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:40.580]   not necessarily being democratic,
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:43.260]   but just like a wider and wider group of people
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.540]   holding power, like all of the business leaders
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:47.500]   and all the things that have been happening
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:50.100]   over the last few centuries have actually widened power.
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.060]   But anything that's moving in the other direction
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:54.820]   does worry me, because it's gonna accentuate
[02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:56.060]   all these five risks.
[02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:58.860]   - I am worried about a little bit of the demonization.
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:03.340]   So one of the things I see with China
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:07.320]   as a problem for Americans, maybe I'm projecting,
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.420]   maybe it's just my own problem,
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:11.100]   but there seems to be a bigger cultural gap
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:13.620]   than there is with other superpowers throughout history,
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:17.900]   where it's almost like this own world happening in China,
[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:19.300]   its own world in the United States,
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:22.260]   and there's this gap of total cultural understanding.
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:27.260]   It's not that, we're not competing superpowers,
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:30.580]   they're almost like doing their own thing.
[02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:33.180]   There's that feeling, and I think that means
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:35.460]   there's a lack of understanding of culture of people,
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:38.060]   and we need to kind of bridge that understanding.
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:39.900]   I mean, the language barrier,
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:42.620]   but also cultural understanding, making movies
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:47.100]   that use both and explore both cultures
[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:48.420]   and all that kind of stuff.
[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:52.020]   Like it's okay to compete, like Rocky,
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:57.020]   where Rocky Balboa fought the Russian.
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:58.700]   Fact, historically inaccurate,
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:00.300]   'cause obviously the Russian would win,
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:02.500]   but we have to, I'm just kidding.
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:04.900]   As a Philly person, I was of course rooting for Rocky.
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:07.980]   But the thing is, those two superpowers are in the movies.
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:11.540]   China's like its own out there thing.
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:14.100]   We need more Rocky Seven.
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:16.060]   - I do think there's a certain inscrutability
[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:18.960]   to the politics there, and an insularity to the politics,
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:20.880]   such that it's harder for Westerners,
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:23.340]   even if they know, even just to learn about it
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:24.660]   and understand what's going on,
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:27.100]   I think that's a problem, and vice versa.
[02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:29.740]   So I think that's true.
[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:32.900]   But at the same time, we could point to all sorts of things
[02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:33.820]   on the other side of the ledger,
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:36.980]   like the massive amounts of Chinese immigration
[02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:39.700]   into the United States, and the massive number of people
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:42.980]   who are now, like how many, so many more Americans,
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:44.620]   business people, politicians,
[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:47.420]   understand so much more about China now
[02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:48.500]   than they did 30, 40 years ago,
[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:50.020]   because we're so intertwined.
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:52.580]   So I don't know where it balances out.
[02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:54.780]   I think it balances out on better understanding
[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:56.220]   than ever before.
[02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:59.540]   But you're right, there was like a big gulf there
[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:02.140]   that we haven't totally bridged.
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:04.220]   - Yeah, and like I said,
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:08.740]   lots of inter-Chinese in the United States,
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:11.140]   sexual intercourse, no, and love and marriage
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:13.740]   and all that kind of social cohesion.
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:16.700]   So once again, returning to love,
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:19.020]   I read in your acknowledgement,
[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:21.140]   and as you mentioned earlier,
[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:23.340]   the acknowledgement reads, quote,
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:25.820]   "I dedicate this book to a slow
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:29.180]   "and now defunct internet cafe in Nairobi,
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.820]   "because it set me on the path to meet,
[02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:34.940]   "work with, and most importantly,
[02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:38.260]   "marry Jenny Anan."
[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:39.100]   - Jeanne Anan.
[02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:40.340]   - Jeanne Anan.
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:43.940]   There's a lot of beautiful letters in this beautiful name.
[02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:47.120]   "This book have been impossible without her
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:49.060]   "and that chance encounter."
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:51.120]   What's, okay, tell me,
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:53.940]   tell me, Chris, how you fell in love
[02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:56.580]   and how that changed the direction of your life.
[02:21:56.580 --> 02:21:59.420]   - I was in that internet cafe, I think it was 2004.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:03.140]   I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:05.100]   I thought I might, I thought,
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:06.500]   I was a good development economist
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:09.300]   and I cared about growth, economic growth,
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:11.940]   and I thought firm, like industrialization
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:14.480]   is like the solution to poverty in Africa,
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:17.140]   which is, I think, still true.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:19.260]   And therefore, I need to go study firms
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:21.180]   and industry in Africa.
[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:22.340]   And so I went and I ended up,
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:24.040]   one of the most dynamic place for firms
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:26.660]   and industry at the time, still to some extent now,
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:29.860]   was Kenya and all these firms around Nairobi.
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:32.780]   And so I went and I got a job with the World Bank
[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:34.620]   who was running a, they were running a firm survey
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:38.340]   and I convinced them to let me help run the firm survey.
[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:40.740]   And so now I'm in Nairobi and I'm wearing my suit
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:43.860]   and with the World Bank for the summer
[02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:48.700]   and my laptop gets stolen by two enterprising con artists,
[02:22:48.700 --> 02:22:50.180]   very charming.
[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:52.260]   And so I find myself in an internet cafe.
[02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:54.380]   - With no laptop.
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:56.460]   - No laptop and just like, you know.
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:57.300]   - In a suit.
[02:22:57.300 --> 02:22:59.420]   - Kenya didn't, exactly, Kenya didn't get connected
[02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:03.940]   to the sort of the big internet cables
[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:05.600]   until maybe 10 years later.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.740]   And so it was just glacially slow.
[02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:08.820]   So it would take 10 minutes for every email to load.
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:10.740]   And so there's this whole customer norm
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:14.940]   of you just chat to the next person beside you all the time.
[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:16.780]   It was true all over,
[02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:18.940]   anywhere I'd worked on the continent.
[02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:22.820]   And so I strategically sat next to the attractive looking
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:24.380]   woman that, when I came in,
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:28.220]   and it turned out she was a psychologist
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:30.940]   and a PhD student, but she was a humanitarian worker.
[02:23:30.940 --> 02:23:33.700]   And she'd been working in South Sudan and Northern Uganda
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:36.340]   and this kids affected by this war.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:39.260]   All these kids who were being conscripted were coming back
[02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:42.740]   'cause they're all running away after a day or 10 years
[02:23:42.740 --> 02:23:45.260]   and needed help or to get back into school.
[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:47.060]   She was working on things like that.
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:50.540]   And I think she talked to me in spite of the fact
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:51.620]   that I was wearing a suit,
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:53.140]   maybe 'cause I knew a little bit about the war,
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:53.980]   which most people didn't.
[02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:55.020]   Most people were totally ignorant.
[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:57.660]   And then we had a fling for that week.
[02:23:57.660 --> 02:24:00.260]   And then we didn't really,
[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:02.700]   actually then we met up a little short while later
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:03.660]   and then it was kind of,
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:04.900]   then we kind of drifted apart.
[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:06.100]   She was studying in Indiana
[02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:09.220]   and spending a lot of time in Uganda.
[02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:14.540]   And then one day I was chatting with someone I knew
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:15.740]   who worked on this,
[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:17.900]   a young professor who was a friend of mine.
[02:24:17.900 --> 02:24:20.500]   And I said, "Oh, you work on similar issues.
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:22.460]   "You should meet this woman."
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:24.860]   I talked to her 'cause you guys would have
[02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:26.460]   professional research interests overlap.
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:29.700]   There's so few sort of people looking at armed groups
[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:32.180]   in African civil wars, at least at the time.
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:35.660]   And he said, "Wow, that's a fascinating research question."
[02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:36.500]   And I thought to my,
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:38.660]   and I walked out of the building and I thought,
[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:40.740]   "That is a fascinating research question."
[02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:43.620]   And I phoned Jeannie and I said,
[02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:45.700]   "Remember me and tell me more."
[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:46.740]   I was just talking to someone about this.
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:48.300]   "Tell me more."
[02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:49.540]   I started asking her more questions
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.380]   but we ended up talking for two or three hours.
[02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:54.460]   And over the course of those three hours,
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:59.460]   we hatched a very ambitious kind of crazy plan.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:03.140]   Basically what it was,
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:06.780]   we were gonna find the names and all the kids
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:10.380]   who were born 20 or 30 years ago in the region,
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:12.700]   and we were gonna track a thousand of them down.
[02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:13.900]   We were gonna randomly sample them
[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:15.700]   and then we were gonna find them today
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:16.620]   and we were gonna track them.
[02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:19.140]   And then we were gonna use some variation
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:21.220]   and exposure to violence and where the rebel group was
[02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:23.620]   to actually show what happens to people
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:25.340]   when they're exposed to violence and conscription.
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:28.020]   We were gonna tell, psychologically, economically,
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:29.820]   we were gonna answer questions
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:31.860]   and that which would help you design better programs.
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:35.220]   And so we hatched this plan, which is totally cockamamie.
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:38.220]   So cockamamie that when I pulled
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:41.780]   my previous dissertation proposal from my committee
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:44.060]   like the next week and gave them a new one,
[02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:47.980]   they unanimously met without me
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.420]   to decide that this was totally bonkers.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.300]   And to advise me not to go.
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:55.180]   And they coordinated to read my old proposal
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:56.500]   so that when I showed up for my defense,
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:57.940]   they said, "You actually think you're defending,
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:00.700]   "but we want you to only talk about this other thing
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:02.540]   "that you were gonna do because this is like,
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:04.100]   "you should not go."
[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:05.380]   - Oh wow.
[02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:07.140]   I mean, it is incredibly ambitious,
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:08.260]   super interesting though.
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:10.220]   - It actually worked exactly according to plan.
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:12.380]   It's the first and last time in my entire career.
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:13.940]   - You actually pulled off an ambitious,
[02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:15.780]   like a gigantically crazy ambitious idea.
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:17.900]   - Well, all of my work, that's my shtick.
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:19.980]   My day-to-day research job is not writing books
[02:26:19.980 --> 02:26:20.820]   about why we fight.
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:24.300]   My thing is like, I go, I collect data on things
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:26.500]   that nobody else thought you could collect data on.
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:28.100]   And so I always do pull it off,
[02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:31.260]   but it never turns out like I thought it was going to.
[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:33.220]   Like it's always, there's so many twists and turns
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:35.980]   and it always goes sideways in an interesting way
[02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:37.140]   and it works, but it's all,
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:40.260]   but this one actually we pulled off in spite of ourselves
[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:42.100]   and as planned.
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:45.060]   And so Ted Miguel, who I wrote that paper with
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:47.740]   was actually the one person of my advisors
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:49.500]   who was like, "Well, you know what?
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:50.820]   He was sympathetic to this."
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:53.460]   He was like, "Eh, why don't you just go for a couple months
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:55.060]   and like check it out and then come back
[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:56.300]   and work on the other thing."
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:58.700]   And that's, and so I followed Jeannie there and went there
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:02.060]   and then, but, and I don't know, what's this?
[02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:04.780]   I always remember, you know, this movie "Speed,"
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:08.940]   the Ken Reeves and Sandra, whatever these people are.
[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:10.460]   And they have this relationship
[02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:12.700]   in these intense circumstances and they like, well,
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:13.820]   and I think at the end of the movie,
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:15.380]   they're sort of like, "This will never work
[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:16.460]   because these relationships
[02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:17.940]   and intense circumstances never matter,"
[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:19.460]   which is what we assumed.
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:21.700]   And that turned out not to be true.
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:25.580]   So we've been married 15 years and we have two kids and--
[02:27:25.580 --> 02:27:28.020]   - Yeah, and that's when you fell in love with psychology
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:30.220]   and learned to appreciate the power of psychology.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:32.820]   - Exactly, so that's the psychology in the book as well
[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:35.460]   because I, and so we ended up, for most of our work
[02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:38.020]   for the first five or 10 years was together actually.
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:40.820]   - What's the hardest piece of data
[02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:44.820]   that you've been chasing, that you've chased?
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:47.060]   And you're like, what are some interesting things?
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:48.620]   'Cause you mentioned like one of the things
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:51.700]   you kind of wanna go somewhere in the world
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:54.580]   and find evidence and data for things
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:56.380]   that people just haven't really looked
[02:27:56.380 --> 02:27:58.900]   to gain an understanding of human nature,
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:00.900]   maybe from an economics perspective.
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:03.900]   What kind of stuff, either in your past
[02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:06.660]   or in your future, you've been thinking about?
[02:28:06.660 --> 02:28:09.180]   - Well, I mean, the hardest, there's heart and two cents.
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:12.500]   The hardest emotionally was interviewing all those kids
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:13.340]   in Northern Uganda.
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:15.940]   That was just like a gut punch every day.
[02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:21.100]   And just hearing the stories like that was the hardest,
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:22.580]   but it wasn't hard because it was,
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:23.820]   you could, the kids were everywhere
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:25.180]   and everybody would talk to you about it
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:26.020]   and they could talk about it.
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:30.460]   You could, no one had gone and interviewed kids
[02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:31.660]   that had gone through war in the middle
[02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:32.500]   of an active war zone.
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:34.260]   Nobody was going to displace, all the things we did,
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:35.400]   no one had done that before.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:37.540]   So now lots of people do it.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:42.540]   - Could you actually speak to their stories?
[02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:45.740]   What's like the shape of their suffering?
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:49.620]   What were common themes?
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:53.540]   What, how did those stories change you?
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:54.380]   - I remember I said you could,
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:56.220]   you have like your dispassionate self
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:28:58.780]   and your passionate self.
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:01.500]   I think I had to learn to create the dispassionate self.
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:02.820]   I mean, we all have that capacity
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:04.340]   when we analyze something that's far away
[02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:05.900]   and happens to people different than us,
[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:10.340]   but you have to, I think I discovered
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:14.300]   and developed an ability to like put those aside
[02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:15.500]   in order to be able to study this.
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:18.980]   So you get maybe harder in a way
[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:20.780]   that you have to be guard against.
[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:24.180]   So you have to try to remember to put your human head on.
[02:29:24.180 --> 02:29:25.020]   It's really horrible.
[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:26.460]   Like if I want to conscript you
[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:29.620]   and I don't want you to run away,
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:31.900]   then I want to make you think you can never go back
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:32.740]   to your village.
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:35.740]   And the best way for me to do that is for,
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:38.500]   to make you, force you to do something really, really,
[02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:41.020]   really, really horrible that you could,
[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:44.100]   you almost incredibly believe you can never really go back.
[02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:46.780]   And it might be like killing a loved one.
[02:29:46.780 --> 02:29:51.340]   And so, and just having, hearing people tell you that story
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:55.180]   in all of the different shapes and forms to a point,
[02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:57.900]   what was horrible about it is they did this so routinely
[02:29:57.900 --> 02:30:00.660]   that you'd be sitting there in an interview with somebody
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:02.180]   and they'd be telling you the story.
[02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:03.700]   And it's like the most horrible thing
[02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:06.180]   that could happen to you or anyone else.
[02:30:06.180 --> 02:30:08.500]   And, but there's some voice in the back of your mind
[02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:13.420]   saying, okay, we really need to get to the other thing.
[02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:15.300]   You know, we know that, I know how this goes.
[02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.900]   Like I've heard, you know, there's this thing like,
[02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:19.460]   okay, okay, I'm not learning anything new here.
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:22.060]   Like there's some part, you know, deep, evil,
[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:24.300]   terrible part of you that's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:26.100]   Like, but let's get onto the other thing.
[02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:27.380]   But I know I have to go through this.
[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:29.660]   But every day you have to go through that to get to the,
[02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:30.940]   'cause you're trying to actually understand
[02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:31.780]   how to help people.
[02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:34.020]   You're trying to understand how that trauma has manifested,
[02:30:34.020 --> 02:30:35.420]   how they either, some people get stronger
[02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:36.260]   as a result of that.
[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:37.580]   Some people get weaker.
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:39.380]   And if you want to know how to help people,
[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:41.020]   then you need to get to that.
[02:30:41.020 --> 02:30:42.140]   I wasn't trying to get to something
[02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:43.340]   for my selfish purposes really.
[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:44.740]   I was trying to figure out, okay,
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:46.580]   we need to know what your symptoms are now.
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:49.500]   - That's such a dark thing about us.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:51.760]   So if you're surrounded by trauma,
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:55.540]   God, that voice in the back of your head
[02:30:55.540 --> 02:30:57.460]   that you just go, yeah, I know exactly
[02:30:57.460 --> 02:30:58.660]   how this conversation goes.
[02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:02.540]   Let's skip ahead to the solutions, to the next.
[02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:03.380]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:05.300]   So that was, yeah, so that was,
[02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:06.660]   because you then have to deal with yourself.
[02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:09.100]   So it's very helpful if you like come home every night
[02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:10.940]   to someone who's A, gone through the same thing,
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:13.460]   and B, is a professional and very, very, very,
[02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:15.500]   very good counseling psychologist.
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:22.060]   The hardest thing, I mean, the organized crime stuff
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:23.340]   has been the hardest.
[02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:25.060]   Just figuring out how to get that information
[02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:27.660]   took us years of just trial and error,
[02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:30.860]   of mostly error, of like just how to get people
[02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:33.180]   to talk to us or how to collect data
[02:31:33.180 --> 02:31:36.900]   in a way that's safe for me and safe for my team
[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:38.700]   and safe for people to answer a survey.
[02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:42.100]   Like how do you get the information
[02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:46.180]   on what gangs are doing in the community
[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:48.020]   or how it's hurting or helping people?
[02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:49.180]   Like you've got to run surveys
[02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:50.460]   and you've got to talk to gang members,
[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:53.580]   all these things that nobody knows how to do that.
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:55.900]   And so we had to sort of really slowly,
[02:31:55.900 --> 02:31:56.740]   not nobody, there's a few other,
[02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.460]   I think there's other academics like me
[02:31:58.460 --> 02:32:01.300]   who are doing this, but it's a pretty small group
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:04.780]   that's trying to like collect systematic data.
[02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:06.700]   And then there's a slightly bigger
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:08.140]   and much more experienced group
[02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:10.620]   that's been talking to different armed groups.
[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:12.420]   But every time you go to a new city,
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:14.060]   and there weren't that many people working on this
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:15.700]   in Medellin, there were a few,
[02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:17.100]   you have to like discover a new.
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:20.500]   Like it's really unique to that city and place.
[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:23.180]   - So there's not like a website
[02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:25.500]   for each of the 17 mafia groups.
[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:26.340]   There's no Facebook group you can DM them.
[02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:27.180]   - Well there is now.
[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:30.580]   We've created like our own, we have a private wiki
[02:32:30.580 --> 02:32:32.100]   where we document everything
[02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:33.380]   and it's a collaborative enterprise
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:35.700]   between lots of researchers and journalists and things.
[02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:36.900]   So they now have, they can't see,
[02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:38.980]   you can't go online and see this.
[02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:40.260]   - That's individual researchers,
[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.940]   so it's not, I mean they're hiding by design.
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:44.820]   - Some of them have Facebook pages
[02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:45.940]   and things of this nature.
[02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:47.860]   So they do have public profiles a little bit,
[02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:50.340]   but not so explicitly.
[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:51.620]   No, so they're clandestine.
[02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:52.460]   Here's an example.
[02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:54.380]   So one of the things that's really endemic in Medellin,
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:55.940]   it's true in a lot of cities,
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:57.300]   it's true in American prisons,
[02:32:57.300 --> 02:33:00.180]   is gangs govern everybody's everyday life.
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:03.180]   So if you have a, in an American prison,
[02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:04.940]   particularly in Illinois or California,
[02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:07.020]   Texas is another big one,
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:09.580]   but also in a city in Medellin,
[02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:11.020]   if you have a problem,
[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:15.060]   a debt to collect or dispute with a neighbor or something,
[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:17.100]   you could go to the government and they do
[02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:18.220]   and they can help you solve it,
[02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:21.140]   or you go to the police or you can go to the gang.
[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:23.740]   And so, and that's like a really everyday phenomenon.
[02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:24.820]   But then there's a question of like,
[02:33:24.820 --> 02:33:27.700]   how do you actually figure out
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:29.500]   what services they're offering
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:30.860]   and how much they pay for them
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:32.380]   and do you actually like those services
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:34.380]   and how do you comparison shop
[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:37.060]   between the police and the gang?
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:40.540]   And what would get you to go from the gang to the police?
[02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:42.100]   And then how's the gang strategically
[02:33:42.100 --> 02:33:43.540]   gonna respond to that?
[02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:46.060]   And what was the impact of previous policies
[02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:48.620]   to like make state governing better?
[02:33:48.620 --> 02:33:49.820]   And how did the gangs react?
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.740]   And so that's, we had to sort of figure that out.
[02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:54.780]   And that was, so that was just hard in a different way,
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:55.700]   but I don't do the most,
[02:33:55.700 --> 02:33:58.220]   the emotionally punishing stuff I couldn't do any longer.
[02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:00.860]   So that's much easier in that sense.
[02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:04.740]   - By the way, on Jorge Ochoa,
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.740]   some of these folks are out of prison.
[02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:09.060]   Have you gotten a chance to talk to anybody?
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:11.020]   - One of my collaborators on this,
[02:34:11.020 --> 02:34:12.180]   a guy named Gustavo Duncan,
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:16.380]   who spent a lot of time interviewing paramilitaries,
[02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.220]   has written a book.
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:20.300]   He's talked to more of these people than I have.
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:22.740]   I haven't talked to those.
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:25.500]   We haven't been talking to them about this stuff.
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.860]   But also, they were there in a different era.
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:28.940]   - Yeah, so it doesn't--
[02:34:28.940 --> 02:34:29.940]   - The system was totally different.
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:30.940]   - That's super interesting.
[02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:31.780]   Maybe one day we'll do that.
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:32.900]   - Almost like history.
[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:35.940]   - Yeah, that was 30 years ago.
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:38.780]   And the system of, I mean, La Oficina,
[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:40.300]   Pablo Escobar created La Oficina.
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:43.940]   He integrated what's, all these 17 Jorazones
[02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:46.020]   and all these street gangs are the fragmented
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:48.740]   former remnants of his more unified empire,
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.500]   which he gave the name La Oficina.
[02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:53.380]   I mean, I think, you know, it's a little bit apocryphal,
[02:34:53.380 --> 02:34:55.540]   but the idea is, you know, I think he said,
[02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:58.540]   every doctor has an office, so should we.
[02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:00.500]   (laughing)
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:03.700]   - I still can't imagine, I still love that there's parallels
[02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:08.420]   between these mafia groups and the United Nations
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:09.540]   Security Council.
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:10.580]   This is just wonderful.
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:13.340]   It's so, so, so deeply human.
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:15.060]   Let me ask you about yourself.
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:17.700]   So you've been thinking about war here,
[02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:22.420]   in part dispassionately, just analyze war
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:24.180]   and try to understand the path for peace.
[02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:26.020]   But you as a single individual
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:30.140]   that's going to die one day,
[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:35.140]   maybe talking to the people that have gone through suffering,
[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:37.820]   do you think about your own mortality?
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:42.980]   How has your view of your own finiteness changed
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:45.220]   having thought about war?
[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:46.700]   - Maybe the reason I can do this work
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:48.940]   is 'cause I don't think about it a lot.
[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:52.020]   - Your own mortality or even like mortality?
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:55.340]   - Yeah, I mean, well, I have to think about death a lot.
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:56.180]   So.
[02:35:57.140 --> 02:35:58.700]   - But there's a way to think about death,
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:01.380]   like numbers in a calculation
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:04.020]   when you're doing geopolitical negotiations.
[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:09.020]   And then there's like a dying child or a dying mother.
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:12.500]   - Yeah, I guess I know I'm in a place where there's risk.
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:17.500]   And so I think a lot about minimizing any risks,
[02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:22.980]   such that I think about mortality enough that I just,
[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:25.740]   'cause I'm kind of an anxious person.
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:28.380]   So like I'm kind of a worry ward, like in a way.
[02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:33.980]   And so I'm really obsessive about making sure
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:36.140]   anything that I do is low risk.
[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:36.980]   You know?
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:39.180]   - That gives you something to focus on,
[02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:42.180]   a number is the risk and you're trying to minimize it.
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:45.940]   And yet there's still the existential dread.
[02:36:45.940 --> 02:36:49.340]   Your risk minimization doesn't matter.
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:52.780]   - Yeah, I've never been in a life-threatening situation.
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:56.260]   - Yeah, that's somebody who,
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:36:57.460]   you know what you sound like?
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:00.580]   That's Alex Honnold that does the free climbing.
[02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:02.140]   He doesn't see that as like.
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:04.060]   - Well, that's, but no, but I, well, that's.
[02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:05.340]   - He sounds exactly the same.
[02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:06.180]   'Cause you just said,
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:08.100]   "I've never done anything as dangerous
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:10.220]   "as those people riding a scooter."
[02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:13.180]   - I've actually been a rock climber for like 25 years
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:15.380]   with a long break in between.
[02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:16.980]   But I'm the same way.
[02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:19.420]   Actually, rock climbing is an extremely safe sport
[02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:21.060]   if you're very careful.
[02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:23.460]   But free climbing is the opposite of that.
[02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:26.940]   But I mean, if you've got a rope that's attached to you
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:31.300]   that goes up, is attached to 18 trees and comes back down,
[02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:32.700]   you're fine.
[02:37:32.700 --> 02:37:35.740]   Like this, and you wear a helmet, you're good.
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:36.780]   You're totally fine.
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:39.460]   - Yeah, but this is super safe too 'cause.
[02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:40.900]   - There's free climbing, no, no, no.
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:42.940]   - We're watching free climbing.
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:45.260]   I mean, because you're only gonna put your hands
[02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:49.340]   and feet on sturdy rock and then you know the path.
[02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:50.900]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:55.180]   Totally, I know, I have some friends in college,
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:58.020]   I've known people who do some of these totally wacky,
[02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:00.020]   extreme sports and have paid the price.
[02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:03.860]   So I think it's totally, totally different.
[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:04.700]   I think.
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:07.820]   - So even in that, by the way, this is still.
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.180]   - I can't even watch those movies
[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:10.380]   'cause those freak me out too much
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:11.540]   'cause it's just too risky.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:13.660]   Like I can't, I don't even, yeah.
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:16.540]   So those things, I've never watched like Free Solo
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:18.860]   or anything, there's just too much.
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:20.620]   - It's still not as dangerous as riding a scooter
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:21.460]   in Austin.
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:22.280]   - Yeah, totally not.
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:23.120]   - I'm not gonna let that go.
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:27.700]   But even in that, it's just risk minimization
[02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:31.660]   in the work that you do versus the sort of philosophical,
[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:34.980]   existentialist view of your mortality.
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:37.820]   You know, this thing just ends.
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:39.180]   Like what the hell is that about?
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.380]   - Yeah, I have this amazing capacity not to think about it
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:44.260]   which might just be a self-defense mechanism.
[02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:46.140]   You know, my father-in-law, Jeannie's father
[02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:48.340]   is an evangelical pastor actually.
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:49.180]   He's now retired.
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:53.260]   But, and this he would, we would talk about
[02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:54.300]   when we were getting married,
[02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:55.740]   they weren't terribly thrilled
[02:38:55.740 --> 02:39:00.740]   that she was marrying a agnostic or atheist or something.
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:02.740]   We could love each other very much, it's fine now.
[02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:05.980]   But I only started discussing this and some of the,
[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:07.620]   'cause that was one of his questions for me.
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:09.700]   Like, well, how can you possibly believe
[02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:11.580]   that there's nothing afterwards?
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:14.740]   Because that's just like too horrible to imagine.
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:17.020]   And we really never saw eye to eye on this.
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:19.420]   And my view was like, listen, like,
[02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:21.060]   I can't convince myself, I believe what I,
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:22.660]   like I can't convince myself otherwise.
[02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:25.300]   Anything else seems completely implausible to me.
[02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:27.420]   And for some reason I can't understand,
[02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:28.420]   I'm at peace with that.
[02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:31.660]   Like it's never bothered me that one day it's over.
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:35.700]   And I understand, the fact that people have angst about that
[02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:39.500]   and that they would seek answers makes total sense to me.
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:43.260]   And I can't explain why that doesn't consume me
[02:39:43.260 --> 02:39:44.500]   or doesn't bother me.
[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:49.340]   - And yet you are at peace.
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:50.860]   - Yep, maybe if I was worried,
[02:39:50.860 --> 02:39:51.980]   but if I was more worried about it,
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:53.980]   maybe I wouldn't be able to do, I don't know.
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:55.740]   I don't know, but then again, I don't take the risk.
[02:39:55.740 --> 02:39:57.100]   I'm still like, I don't know.
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:39:58.660]   But I minimize all sorts of risks.
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:03.020]   I'm like, yeah, I minimize,
[02:40:03.020 --> 02:40:06.420]   I try to optimize like groceries in the fridge too.
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:07.780]   Like, I mean, I put--
[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:11.260]   - That's a very economist way to live, I would say.
[02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:12.700]   That's probably why you're good at--
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:13.540]   - That might be true.
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:15.700]   That might be there's some selection in economics
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:17.540]   of these cold calculators.
[02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:19.180]   - Chicken or the egg, we'll never know.
[02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:21.300]   Do you have advice for young people
[02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:24.700]   that want to do as ambitious, as crazy,
[02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:28.420]   as amazing of work as you have done in life?
[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:31.620]   So somebody who's in high school, in college,
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:34.660]   either career advice on what to choose,
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:38.180]   how to execute on it, or just life advice.
[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:40.780]   How to meet some random stranger,
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:41.980]   or maybe a dating advice.
[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:43.700]   (laughing)
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:44.540]   - That part's easier.
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:47.780]   You have to fly coach and go to the internet cafes.
[02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:49.860]   You can't like, yeah, all the development workers
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.180]   that I know that fly business class,
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:53.220]   I'm like, you'll never meet somebody.
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:57.140]   No, I actually spent a lot of time writing advice
[02:40:57.140 --> 02:40:59.900]   on my blog, and I've got like pages and pages of advice.
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:02.100]   And one of the reasons is 'cause I never got that.
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:03.980]   Like when I grew up, I went to like a really good
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:07.060]   state school in Canada called Waterloo.
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:09.460]   I loved it, but people didn't go on the trajectory
[02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:10.780]   that I went on from there.
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:12.820]   And I had some good advisors there,
[02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:15.260]   but I never got the kind of advice I needed
[02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:16.300]   to like pursue this career.
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:20.860]   So it's very concentrated in elite colleges,
[02:41:20.860 --> 02:41:22.620]   I think sometimes, in elite high schools.
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:24.420]   So I tried to democratize that.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:27.180]   That was one reason I started the blog.
[02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:28.380]   But a lot of that's really particular,
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:30.900]   'cause every week I have students coming in my office
[02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:32.700]   wanting to know how to do international development work,
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:34.380]   and I just spend a lot of time giving them advice,
[02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:36.260]   and that's what a lot of the posts are about.
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:37.780]   - Do you have very specific questions?
[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:39.700]   Like what, is it like country by country
[02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:41.340]   kind of specific questions, or what?
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:42.460]   - The thing that they're all trying to do
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:43.900]   that I think is the right, I don't have to give them
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:45.220]   a really basic piece of advice,
[02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:46.460]   'cause they're already doing it.
[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:48.500]   Like they're trying to find a vocation.
[02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:51.300]   They're really interested, and what I mean by that
[02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:53.620]   is it's like a career where they find meaning,
[02:41:53.620 --> 02:41:56.820]   where the work is almost like superfluous,
[02:41:56.820 --> 02:41:59.380]   because they would do it for free.
[02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:00.460]   And they're passionate about it,
[02:42:00.460 --> 02:42:02.860]   and they really find meaning in the work.
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:05.100]   And then it becomes a little bit all-consuming.
[02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:07.260]   So scientists do that in their own way,
[02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:09.180]   I think international development, humanitarian workers,
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:11.180]   people who are doctors and nurses.
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:13.100]   Like we all do our careers for other reasons, right?
[02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:16.980]   But they find meaning in their career.
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:19.740]   And so the thing, so I don't have to tell them
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:21.340]   whatever you do, find meaning.
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:24.380]   And try to make it a vocation,
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.700]   something that you would do for free
[02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:28.000]   amongst all of these many, many, many options.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.780]   That's what I would tell,
[02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:32.780]   but that's what I would tell high school students
[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:35.340]   and young people in college.
[02:42:35.340 --> 02:42:39.940]   - Sometimes it's hard to find a thing and hold onto it.
[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:41.980]   - Well, that's the other thing, it took me a long time.
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:43.900]   So I actually started off as an accountant.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:46.580]   I was an accountant with Deloitte and Touche for a few years.
[02:42:46.580 --> 02:42:47.900]   So I did not--
[02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:50.460]   - But that, did you wake up in the morning
[02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:52.540]   excited to be alive?
[02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:53.380]   - I was miserable.
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:56.760]   I found it by accident, which is another different story.
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:59.460]   But I landed in this job and a degree
[02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:01.540]   where I studied accounting, and I was miserable.
[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:03.460]   I was totally miserable.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:06.140]   And I hated it, and I was becoming a miserable person.
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:10.620]   And so I eventually just quit, and I did something new.
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:11.940]   But that still, you know,
[02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:13.980]   but then I was working in the private sector.
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:15.740]   And I actually just needed trial and error.
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:18.200]   I actually had to try on three or four or five careers
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:21.200]   before I found this mixture of academia and activism
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.540]   and research and international development.
[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:26.580]   - And what did you know that this was love
[02:43:26.580 --> 02:43:29.460]   when you found this kind of international development?
[02:43:29.460 --> 02:43:32.500]   The academic context, too?
[02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:34.140]   - The key lesson was just trial and error,
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:36.900]   which we all have to engage in until it feels right.
[02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:38.620]   - So okay, all right, step one is trial and error,
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:41.660]   but until it feels right, 'cause like,
[02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:44.260]   it often feels right but not perfect.
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:46.740]   - Yeah, well, and if it's true, right enough.
[02:43:46.740 --> 02:43:48.780]   I mean, I was really intellectually engaged.
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:50.100]   Like, I just loved learning about it.
[02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:53.260]   I wanted to read more, like, in some sense, like,
[02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:54.860]   like I was doing, I was an accountant,
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:57.540]   but I was reading about, like, world history
[02:43:57.540 --> 02:43:58.380]   and international development
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:00.700]   in poor countries in my spare time, right?
[02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:02.500]   And so it was like this hobby, and I was like,
[02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:04.300]   wait a second, I could actually do that.
[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:06.820]   Like, just, I could, like, research this
[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:08.260]   and even write the neck of those books,
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:11.500]   and that's kind of what I did, like, 25 years later.
[02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:12.620]   That didn't occur to me right away.
[02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:14.180]   I didn't even know it was possible.
[02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:15.380]   This is the other thing people do.
[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:17.260]   People do their nine to five job,
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:19.180]   and then they find meaning in everything else they do.
[02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:20.780]   They're volunteering, and they're family,
[02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:21.860]   and they're hobbies and things,
[02:44:21.860 --> 02:44:23.260]   and that was my social milieu,
[02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:25.740]   and that's a great path, too.
[02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:27.300]   Like, I mean, that's, 'cause not all of us
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.380]   can just have a vocation or we don't find it, I think,
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:31.540]   and then you just circumscribe what you do in your work,
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:32.580]   and then you go find,
[02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:35.020]   and that's not entirely true,
[02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:37.460]   'cause everyone in my family does like their job
[02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:39.300]   and get a lot of fulfillment out of it,
[02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:41.500]   but I think it's not.
[02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:44.820]   That's a different path in some ways.
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:47.100]   - So it's good to take the leap and keep trying stuff,
[02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:51.020]   even when you've found, like, a little local minima.
[02:44:51.020 --> 02:44:53.580]   - Yeah, the hardest part was,
[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:57.180]   it got easy after a while, it was quitting,
[02:44:57.180 --> 02:44:58.700]   but now I take this to a lot of,
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:00.020]   you know, and one of the people,
[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:02.780]   I think one of the reasons I discovered your podcast
[02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:04.220]   or maybe Tyler Cowen.
[02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:05.220]   - Yeah, he's amazing.
[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:07.300]   - Tyler takes this approach to everything.
[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:09.460]   He takes this approach to movie.
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:11.580]   He's like, "Walk into the movie theater
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:14.020]   "after half an hour if you don't like the movie."
[02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:17.220]   - You know what kind of person he probably is?
[02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:18.900]   I don't know, but now that you say this,
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:21.180]   he's probably somebody that goes to a restaurant,
[02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:23.260]   if the meals is not good,
[02:45:23.260 --> 02:45:24.780]   I could see him just walking away,
[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:26.500]   like, paying for it and just walking away.
[02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:28.700]   - Yeah, and to go eat something better.
[02:45:28.700 --> 02:45:31.460]   That's exactly right, and I thought that was kind of crazy,
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.740]   and I'd never, I was the person,
[02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:34.900]   I would never just put a book down halfway,
[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:38.380]   and I would never stop watching a movie,
[02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:39.900]   but then I, and I convinced my wife,
[02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:43.220]   we lived in New York when we were single initially,
[02:45:43.220 --> 02:45:45.260]   sorry, when we were childless,
[02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:47.740]   and we lived in New York,
[02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:49.940]   there's all this culture and theater and stuff,
[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:51.660]   and I just said, "Let's go to more plays,
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:54.020]   "but let's just walk out after the first act
[02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:54.940]   "if we don't like it,"
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:56.300]   and she thought that was a bit crazy,
[02:45:56.300 --> 02:45:57.580]   and I was like, "No, no, no, here's the logic,
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:45:58.980]   "here's what Tyler says,"
[02:45:58.980 --> 02:45:59.860]   and then we started doing it,
[02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:01.260]   and it was so freeing and glorious.
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:04.220]   We'd just go, we'd take so many more chances on things,
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:05.940]   and we would, and if we didn't like it,
[02:46:05.940 --> 02:46:08.660]   and we were walking out of stuff all the time,
[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:11.180]   and so I think I did that,
[02:46:11.180 --> 02:46:13.020]   without realizing it, that's how I took,
[02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:15.300]   I just kept quitting my jobs
[02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:17.900]   and trying to find something else at some risk.
[02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:20.100]   - 'Cause that's how wars start, without the commitment.
[02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:21.100]   (laughing)
[02:46:21.100 --> 02:46:24.460]   I go to time back to, you need the commitment,
[02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:26.300]   otherwise, no.
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:27.820]   - That's a different kind of commitment problem.
[02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:29.780]   That's a different commitment problem.
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:31.740]   - But some of it, I'm sure there's a balance,
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:33.100]   'cause I mean, the same thing is happening
[02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:35.220]   with dating and marriage and all those kinds of things,
[02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:38.420]   and there's some value to sticking it out,
[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:41.820]   'cause some of the, like, maybe, you know,
[02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:43.300]   don't leave after the first act,
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:45.580]   'cause the good stuff might be coming later.
[02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:46.620]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:47.860]   I mean, that's, yeah. - The balance.
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:50.100]   - Well, I don't know.
[02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:51.780]   So when I met Jeannie,
[02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:53.580]   she was very wary of a relationship with me,
[02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:55.260]   because I explained to her,
[02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:57.700]   I hadn't had a relationship longer
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:00.100]   than two or three months and 11 years.
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:01.860]   And so she thought this person's not serious.
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:03.940]   And what I said to her, and she tells the story,
[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:04.820]   this is how she tells the story,
[02:47:04.820 --> 02:47:06.180]   she says, "I didn't believe him when he said
[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:07.700]   "that I just, after two or three months,
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:09.420]   "you kind of have a good sense
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:10.700]   "of whether this is going somewhere,
[02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:12.940]   "and I would just decide if it was over."
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:13.780]   And I walk away.
[02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:14.620]   So I took this approach to dating,
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:17.140]   like, as soon as I thought it wasn't gonna go somewhere.
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:20.420]   And then I decided with her that this was it,
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:21.860]   this was gonna work, and then I like,
[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:24.020]   and then never, and she didn't believe,
[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:25.260]   now she believes me.
[02:47:25.260 --> 02:47:26.620]   (laughing)
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:29.100]   - You finally got to be right.
[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:31.020]   Okay, so this is an incredible conversation.
[02:47:31.020 --> 02:47:32.580]   Your work is so fascinating,
[02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:35.860]   just in this big picture way,
[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:39.020]   looking at human conflict and how we can achieve peace,
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:42.420]   especially in this time of the Ukraine war.
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:44.020]   I really, really, really appreciate
[02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:46.420]   that you would calmly speak to me
[02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:47.980]   about some of these difficult ideas,
[02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:50.380]   and explain them, and that you would sit down with me,
[02:47:50.380 --> 02:47:51.740]   and have this amazing conversation.
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:52.580]   Thank you so much. - It was an amazing
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:54.620]   conversation, thank you.
[02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:56.140]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.340]   with Chris Blattman.
[02:47:57.340 --> 02:47:58.580]   To support this podcast,
[02:47:58.580 --> 02:48:00.980]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:48:00.980 --> 02:48:03.420]   And now, let me leave you with some well-known,
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:06.220]   simple words from Albert Einstein.
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:10.700]   I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought,
[02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:14.500]   but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
[02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:18.340]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:20.980]   (upbeat music)
