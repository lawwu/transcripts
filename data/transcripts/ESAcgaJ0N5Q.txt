[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.320]   - Well, this podcast often addresses gospel boldness,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.800]   and we talk about risk-taking,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.460]   and we talk about personal suffering.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.040]   And on occasion, those three themes,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.040]   boldness, risk, and suffering,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.840]   merge together like they do today
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.120]   in a sermon clip from the ministry of John Piper.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.320]   Today, we look specifically at how the assurance
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160]   of the hope of heaven releases us for radical,
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.560]   risk-taking love that makes people look at our lives
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.880]   and ask for the reason for the hope that is in us,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.080]   as Peter says in 1 Peter 3:15.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.960]   So how do we escape the natural love of safety?
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   Here's Pastor John's answer from 30 years ago
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.440]   in a sermon on Revelation 21.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.280]   Have a listen.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.680]   - Richard Baxter was a very effective pastor
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.440]   in the 17th century in England.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.840]   He's well-known for his book, "The Reformed Pastor."
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440]   Not many people know, however,
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.960]   that Richard Baxter labored for all the years of his life
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.160]   under tremendous pain.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   He had frequent nosebleeds,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040]   constant cough, headaches, digestive ailments,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.280]   kidney stones, gallstones.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.720]   He believed in supernatural healing.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.160]   He testified several times that God had delivered him
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.440]   out of a deadly disease to keep on ministering
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.960]   by a direct intervention.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.400]   In fact, he told a story one time of entering the pulpit
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.280]   and he could see in the looking glass
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.760]   a big cancerous tumor on the back of his throat
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.400]   that vanished while he was preaching
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.600]   and testifying to the grace of God.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.160]   And yet, all his life, from the age of 21 on,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.560]   he testified, "There's never been an hour almost
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.040]   "when I have been without pain."
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760]   One of the effects on Richard Baxter's life
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.040]   is that it made him keenly aware of how short life is
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   and how certain death is and how precious heaven is.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520]   When he was 35 years old,
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   he became what he thought was mortally ill
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.360]   and he was on his bed and he thought he was dying.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.800]   And he formed a habit, which as it turned out,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.920]   lasted for 40 years 'cause he didn't die.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.800]   And the habit was meditating a half an hour a day
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.200]   on the glories of heaven.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.800]   The reason he formed this habit and maintained this habit
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.600]   is because of the profound effect that it had on his life,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.200]   keeping him awake to the things of God
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.080]   and to the brevity of this life.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.720]   He wrote down those reflections in those days
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.560]   and they became a book called "The Saints' Everlasting Rest,"
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.160]   which is still in print 300 years later
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   to testify to the power of this man's vision
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   of what he had seen of God's glorious hope for the believer.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.000]   He commended it to us,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   that we would take time each day to set our minds on heaven.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.920]   This is the way he said it.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.040]   "If you would have light and heat,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.200]   why are you not more in the sunshine?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.520]   For want of this recourse to heaven,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   your soul is as a lamp not lighted
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.600]   and your duty as a sacrifice without fire.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.800]   Fetch one coal daily from this altar
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.600]   and see if your offering will not burn.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.760]   Keep close to this reviving fire
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   and see if your affections will not be warm."
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.400]   Now, that's good advice.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   I think it's the same advice that Paul gave in Colossians chapter 3.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   He said, following up on last Sunday's message, as it were,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.200]   "If you have been raised with Christ,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.400]   seek the things that are above,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.200]   Set your mind on things that are above,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.600]   not on things that are on the earth.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.400]   For you have died and your life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   When Christ, who is your life, appears,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   then you will appear with Him in glory."
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.400]   Now, I want to ask you, do you do that? Do you obey that?
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   How frequently do you set your mind on things that are above and dwell there?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.600]   How frequently do you seek the future?
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   Do you seek the age to come?
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.400]   Do you look to where your life is hid with Christ in God
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   and anticipate the glory that will be you when you come with Him?
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   And you, in your true life, are revealed.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   We are so addicted to the world.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.800]   So, I just want to invite you, with Richard Baxter, to do what he did,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   and every day to set your mind on things that are above.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   And I want you to repudiate with me a lie that goes like this.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   Well, if you spend time thinking about heaven,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   if you dwell on the age to come and the glories of your hope,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   you're going to become of no earthly good whatsoever.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   Now, that's a lie. It's a common one.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   I think exactly the opposite is the case.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   It's the people who know their hope,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   who know that their destiny is rock solid and sure,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   who know that their destiny is glorious,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   who are free to take risks of love,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   free to let good and kindred go, this mortal life also,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   the body they may kill, God's truth abideth still.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   I've got a destiny, I've got a future, I cannot die.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   Mark it, it is not the people who have that hope,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   who have that security, who live in that confidence,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   who live their lives gathering treasures on earth and ignore the needs of people.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   It's people who are free, who don't need money,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   who don't need comforts, who don't need worldly acclaim,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   because they've got it all in Jesus,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   who are free to take risks for others.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   1 Peter says,
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   "When people ask you a reason for the hope that is in you,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   be ready to give an answer."
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   Now, have you ever had anybody ask you a reason for the hope that is in you?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   Look at your behavior and say, "My,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   what hope must be behind that behavior?"
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   I ask you, "What kind of behavior would that be?"
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   If somebody jumps out of an airplane,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   you don't jump out behind them with no parachute.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   Two dead people aren't better than one.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   So, if somebody falls out of an airplane with no parachute on,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   you might jump out after them,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   if you have a parachute on,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   and you try one of those bullet dives to catch them.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   So, they're falling kind of loose and stopping a lot of air, 110 miles an hour maybe,
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   and you go bullet-like, 150 miles an hour maybe.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   You might do that,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   because the security and the hope of this parachute
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   free you for that kind of love,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   free you for that kind of risk-taking.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   So, if somebody's in the airplane, and they see you about to jump,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   and they ask you, "What's the reason for the hope that you have
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   to jump out of this airplane to try to catch somebody?
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   What's the reason for your hope?"
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   You say, "The parachute. It's called the hope of glory.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   The parachute, that's my hope."
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   And then you jump.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   Now, I want to ask you, what kind of lifestyle
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   will move people to ask you questions like that about your hope?
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Gathering money?
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   No, because they'll assume money is your hope.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   Gathering comforts?
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Comforts are your hope.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   Spending all your time watching television?
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   No, television is your hope.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   Hope frees for a radical new lifestyle.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   So, I want to call you with Richard Baxter,
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   and I want to call you with the Apostle Paul,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   if you have been raised with Christ.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   If your life is hid with Christ in God, out there, secure,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   it's done, absolutely.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   You cannot die.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   You cannot lose.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   If it's that sure, I want to invite you,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   set your mind on things that are above.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   Seek the things that are above where Christ is seated.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   Let your mind dwell on the glories of the age to come,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   and you know what will happen?
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   You will become a free person.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   And free people are dangerous people to the kingdom of Satan,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   because they don't ask cautionary questions about what it will cost in this life.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   They throw that to the wind,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   and they love, and they sacrifice,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   and they go, and they serve,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   and they change the world.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   This world, of all things, of all things,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   can you imagine that?
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   People in love with heaven are the ones that are free to change this world.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   Amen. Heaven changes our lives if we truly believe.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   That powerful clip was pulled from John Piper's sermon on Revelation 21, verses 1 to 8.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   It's titled, "Behold, I Make All Things New,"
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   and it was preached 30 years ago on April 26, 1992.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   This clip was sent in by Brittany, a frequent listener to the podcast.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   Thank you for this clip, Brittany. I appreciate it.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   And thank you for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   All our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life,
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   and we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   If you've got a clip, email me.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   and tell me how it impacted your life.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   Well, we're going to end the week looking at that mention in Galatians chapter 4
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   about the cry, that cry, "Abba, Father. Abba, Father."
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   So what exactly is that "Abba, Father" experience?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   What's happening to us, and what's happening in us?
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   Is this "Abba, Father" cry my cry?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   Is it the Holy Spirit crying in and through me?
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   And does this text, this cry, apply to the struggling believer?
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   When Pastor John is back in studio with me on Friday,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   I hope to see you then. Thanks for listening.

[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   [Silence]
