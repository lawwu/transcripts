[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.680]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.560]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.280]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and as some of you know,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.320]   I'm working on an idea for a book right now
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.800]   about the principles of an optimized life,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.240]   and it'll be no surprise
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.300]   that money fits into the book a bit.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.560]   And one of the things I was doing
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.280]   as I was brainstorming that topic
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.200]   was going back and listening to some older episodes I did
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.720]   on money, investing, personal finance,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.000]   and one of those episodes really stood out to me.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.680]   It was episode number six with best-selling author
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.360]   Morgan Housel on the psychology of money.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760]   For those not familiar with Morgan,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.120]   he's a notable blogger,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000]   former columnist at The Motley Fool
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.940]   and The Wall Street Journal,
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.820]   and a partner at Collaborative Fund.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.840]   Now, what stood out to me about that episode
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200]   was that even though I did the original interview,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.760]   and then I edited the entire interview,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.040]   and then I listened to the final version
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.640]   before I released it,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.900]   when I listened to it again last week, it was so good.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.680]   I picked up on things that I either missed
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.480]   the first few times or have forgotten since then.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.720]   And in that conversation,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.920]   we talked about behavioral finance, investing,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.060]   dealing with risk, and approaches you can take
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.000]   to be more productive with your money.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.560]   In fact, I enjoyed re-listening the episode so much,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.660]   I suggested my wife, Amy, listen again,
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.160]   and she had the exact same reaction.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.120]   So, since it's been two years,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.840]   I know many of you have never even heard that episode,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780]   but if you're one of the few who already have,
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.700]   I'd encourage you to give it another listen
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.760]   and see if you pick up on something new.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.440]   And whether you do or don't,
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.840]   please send me a note,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800]   because it's the first time I've done an episode like this
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000]   where I bring back an interview from the past.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.040]   And while I don't plan to do it that often,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.340]   I'd love to hear what you think.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.960]   So please shoot me a quick email,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.680]   podcast@allthehacks.com,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   or you can DM me on Instagram or Twitter.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.520]   But like I said,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.120]   I think you're really gonna enjoy this one.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.300]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.360]   I used to say I didn't think buying a second home
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.960]   was a good financial decision,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.520]   but then I discovered fractional vacation home ownership,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.640]   and I actually bought one with Picasso.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.200]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.600]   Don't worry, this is not a timeshare pitch.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.880]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.680]   then creates an LLC for each home
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.200]   so you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.520]   and have real ownership.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.800]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.600]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.360]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance, bills,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.280]   repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.280]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.800]   When we first heard about Picasso,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.220]   it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.840]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.320]   toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.720]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.540]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.600]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.720]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.160]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.520]   So for a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.480]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.800]   where All The Hacks listeners
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.200]   will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   which means you can see new listings
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.700]   before they go live on the website,
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.900]   and up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso, P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.440]   Morgan, thank you for being here.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.280]   - Thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.100]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.640]   - So you've been writing columns, articles, blog posts
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.880]   about money and investing for almost 15 years.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.240]   What about the psychology of money
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.680]   led you to write an entire book this time?
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.160]   - What actually got me to write the book
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.280]   was just the realization
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.160]   that I had accumulated enough stories,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.980]   enough material to fill out a book.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.160]   That's the honest answer.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.360]   And it took a long time.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.480]   It took 10 or 15 years of casual observing
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.560]   and reading about a bunch of things
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.480]   that led me to find what I thought
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.640]   were the most important parts
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.320]   about how people think about money,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.200]   and kind of how I've always thought about this.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.960]   Not always, but the main way that I've written,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   not just written, but thought about
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.160]   and researched behavioral finance
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.080]   is through the lens of other industries.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.920]   And the reason that is,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.280]   if I take you back to when I started writing about finance,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.560]   which was 2008,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.280]   which of course is when the world fell apart,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.240]   the financial crisis,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.600]   everything was breaking and crumbling down around us.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.440]   In my early years of becoming a financial writer,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.240]   I wanted to answer the question,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.080]   why did people do the things that they did
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.180]   during the housing bubble, during the financial crisis?
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.540]   Why did people take on so much debt?
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.600]   Why did they make all these dumb, crazy decisions
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.000]   that blew the world to pieces?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.840]   Why did they do it?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's what I wanted to answer.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.280]   And I realized, as years went on,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.160]   that the answer to those questions
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.120]   could not be found in a finance textbook
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.320]   or an economics textbook.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.000]   You could not explain why people did what they did
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   if you were just looking at finance,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.200]   or thinking through the lens and the frameworks
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.440]   and the theories of finance.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.900]   The answers weren't there.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.400]   But you could find clues,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.640]   like these tangential clues about why people
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.560]   did what they did,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.400]   if you were thinking about psychology and sociology
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.520]   and political science and biology and neurology.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.800]   All these things that had nothing to do with finance
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.400]   could actually explain
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.120]   why people did the things that they did.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.600]   Things like sociology, like keeping up with the Joneses,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.920]   or your brother-in-law buys a big house,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.360]   so now you gotta go buy a big house.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.200]   Finance can't explain that, but sociology can.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.920]   So to me, that just started this idea
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.200]   that money is not the study of finance.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.940]   It's a study of how people behave,
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.520]   like how people behave with money.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.800]   And since it's a study of behavior,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.720]   you can learn so much about it
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   through the lens of all these other disciplines.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.760]   And so I spent the huge majority of my time,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.040]   I almost never read finance books or economic books.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.520]   I read books about all kinds of different topics,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.240]   just trying to answer the question,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.080]   how do people respond and behave around fear and greed
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.240]   and risk and uncertainty?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   And just trying to piece together little bits and stories
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.680]   about how people behave.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.640]   And so I just did that for many years,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.040]   more than a decade before I felt like I had enough
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.960]   to throw it all together into a book,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.040]   and that's where this came from.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.880]   - I'm glad you did.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.240]   When I was in college,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.080]   my wife and I actually went to college together,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.540]   and she had a major in finance,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.380]   and all of a sudden she was like,
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.080]   "Wait, finance is all about,"
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.120]   and I remember specifically taking
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.320]   the Fundamentals of Futures and Options Markets
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   with her as a course in college.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.200]   And she was like, "This isn't what I care."
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.360]   I was really interested in how people think about money.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.020]   I'm not interested in the Black-Scholes model
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.120]   for pricing options.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.200]   And so that actually, I think if your book was around,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.840]   she could have taken a different path,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.720]   but she got out of finance pretty quickly
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.560]   'cause it was not framed around
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.300]   how people think about money.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.720]   - So that's actually a really good point
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.600]   because the behavioral side of finance,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.800]   the psychology side of finance, is really hard to teach.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.000]   Even to really smart people, it's hard to teach.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.440]   So what tends to be taught in finance,
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.900]   in colleges and whatnot,
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.240]   is the part that is relatively easy to teach.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.320]   There's all the formulas and the data and the charts,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.440]   the things that you can memorize
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.800]   and regurgitate on a test.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.260]   The softer side of finance is just, it's much more mushy.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.680]   It's much more like answering the question,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.360]   how do you become a good spouse?
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.220]   It's hard, you can't teach that in college.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.800]   It's a really important topic.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.200]   It might be the most important topic of your entire life,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.040]   but you can't summarize it into a formula,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.280]   so you can't teach it.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   And this is true for a lot of disciplines.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.480]   What is taught in school
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.240]   are the things that are able to be taught,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.360]   like the things that you can teach.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.720]   But there's a lot of things that you just can't teach.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.560]   How do you teach someone to respond well
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.320]   around greed and fear?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.440]   Tough thing to teach that
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   in a way that you're gonna be able to test someone
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.560]   on a midterm for.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.640]   So it's a great point that you and your wife brought up
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.440]   about how finance is typically taught
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.000]   versus what it actually is in the real world.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080]   - Yeah, and there's so much in the book
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.000]   about how to start thinking about different things.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.480]   Before going kind of deep on a few of those,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.440]   I'd love to talk a little bit about the ultimate goal
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.840]   of learning and mastering money.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.400]   I think you have a pretty good framework
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.040]   for what that unlocks in life
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.400]   and kind of what the highest form of wealth is.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.160]   And I'd love to hear you kind of talk
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.560]   a little bit about that.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.880]   - To me, the highest form of wealth
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.520]   is you wake up every morning
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.680]   and you're gonna say that you can do
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.800]   whatever you want today.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.840]   Whatever you wanna do.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.240]   Even if most of the time what you wanna do
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.440]   is wake up and go to work
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.240]   and be a productive member of society,
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.480]   it's on your terms.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.240]   You're doing it at the company you want
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.200]   for as long as you want.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.360]   You can live where you want.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.200]   You can work with the coworkers who you want.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.360]   Having a sense of independence and autonomy,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.440]   being on your own terms,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.120]   owning your time, owning your schedule,
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.760]   having control over your schedule,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.600]   that to me is the highest form of wealth.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.120]   And it's important because everyone knows,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.800]   I mean this is virtually cliche at this point,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   but you get used to things.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   Cars, homes, it's not that it's bad.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.240]   I like nice cars as much as anyone else.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.840]   But people get accustomed to them.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.880]   The joy that you get from them
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.480]   is gonna work for virtually anyone.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.520]   People massively overestimate how much joy
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.840]   you're gonna get from stuff.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.680]   It's not that stuff is bad,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.880]   you just overestimate it.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.040]   But owning your time, owning your schedule,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.600]   having independence and autonomy
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.200]   is something that I think will give you
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.360]   a permanent level of lasting happiness.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.640]   Or I think a better, like a little bit of nuance here
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.160]   is that it's not that having independence
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   gives you, makes you happier,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.920]   it's that it makes you less miserable.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.680]   Like people who don't control their time
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.120]   just have more bad days
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.880]   than people who have that level of independence.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   So to the extent that people can use money
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.760]   and wealth and savings to gain autonomy in their life,
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.520]   that to me is like the highest form of wealth.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.560]   And there's a couple things about it.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.760]   One is that for a lot of people,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.680]   the amount of wealth that you need
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.920]   to gain some level of independence and autonomy
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.240]   is a lot lower than I think
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.880]   what most people would consider rich.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.960]   And the definition of rich
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.480]   is different for everyone throughout the world,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.320]   different people, different generations.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.040]   But having just a level of savings
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.680]   so that for example, if you were to lose your job,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.880]   you can wait to find a good job
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   rather than having to take the first one
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.080]   that you can possibly find,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   that's a level of independence
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.560]   that can make your life substantially better.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.760]   Having just enough savings
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.080]   that if you have a medical emergency,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.640]   it's not gonna ruin you,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.720]   which for whom it does millions of Americans every year,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   that's a level of independence and autonomy.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.200]   So like obviously independence is a spectrum.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.840]   A lot of people when they think of independence,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.320]   they think the fire movement,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.040]   retire early, quit your job,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.820]   go like on a road trip around the country.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.880]   That's one level.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.080]   But there's a big spectrum below that
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.360]   that can lead to a lot of happiness
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.680]   of just being in control of your time.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.240]   The other way that people talk about this
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.580]   is of course like the well-known phrase, F you money.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.620]   Like so much money that you can just say F you
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.300]   to people who you don't wanna deal with.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.760]   That's one level of this that gets talked about.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.520]   And I think there's like a more polite version of that.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.460]   I call it like, please leave me alone money,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.080]   of just like, if you have enough money,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000]   you don't have to deal
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   with a lot of the hassles that you have in life.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.580]   You can just like, look, I don't report to anyone.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.480]   I'm not on anyone else's quarterly performance metrics.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.240]   You can just kind of live the life that you want
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.880]   and pursue the creative ventures that you want
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.320]   in a way that I think is really underestimated in life.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.900]   - Yeah, I think in today's environment,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.040]   I hear lots of people say, gosh, you shouldn't hold any cash.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.160]   It's the interest rates are so low
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.920]   that you actually forget that the value
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.120]   or the kind of return on that money
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.160]   that's sitting in cash
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.820]   can be something really, really significant
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.680]   if you are able to use it to turn down a job
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.580]   or you're able to use it to work less hours
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.040]   on your hourly job and pursue something you're excited about.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.220]   So I'm a big fan of using cash to buy yourself freedom
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.340]   and treating that freedom as a similar return,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.380]   though very different from the kind of return
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.660]   that's more tangible of investment returns
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.500]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.140]   - You're so right that people look at the return on cash
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.220]   and they say, look, 0.1% interest.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.620]   Like, why would I possibly do that?
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.860]   And then once they hit,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.840]   whether it's next month or five years from now,
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.760]   once they hit some sort of life emergency
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.880]   where they need that cash
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.080]   and they realize that cash is the oxygen of independence.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.960]   Like, you don't think about it until you need it
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.800]   and then when you need it,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.360]   it's the most important thing in the world,
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.720]   nothing else matters.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.640]   And so I think once every 10 years,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.520]   at least everybody, everybody once every 10 years
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.320]   will have something happens in their life
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   where they think, where they realize,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.280]   oh, I'm so glad I had this buffer of cash
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.540]   that I didn't know what I was gonna do with
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.740]   or, oh my gosh, I wish I'd like,
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.040]   things would have been so much better
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.360]   if I had just saved a little bit of cash.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.740]   Everyone will deal with that once every 10 years.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.440]   And during the other 99.9% of the time,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.060]   your cash feels like it's a drag on your net worth.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.400]   And then one week every 10 years,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.480]   it's the most important thing
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.720]   that completely transforms your life
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.000]   because it gives you options over your time,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.400]   over your control of what you're gonna do
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.080]   and where you have to go, et cetera.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.480]   - So building up that cash,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.920]   there's lots of ways to do that.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.960]   And it ultimately comes down to having more money
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.640]   and you could save more or you can earn more.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.480]   And by earn more, you could work
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.040]   or make investments that grow.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.520]   I personally think that saving is much easier to focus on.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.200]   It's totally in your control,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.280]   but it seems like everyone I talk to
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.120]   is focused on making more money
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.640]   and usually making more money from investments
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.520]   and seeking high returns.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.680]   Why do you think it's so hard for people
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.960]   to save more and spend less?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.600]   - I think, look, both sides of the equation
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.440]   are really important.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.960]   Like, of course, earning more and like proper investing
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.120]   and like long-term compounding,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.200]   that's so important, of course.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.120]   But I think the side of the equation,
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.560]   which is just, you know,
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.440]   like all of wealth is money in minus money out.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.280]   Like that's what it is.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.080]   And the money outside of the equation
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.920]   is just more in your control.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.100]   Like to double your money in the stock market
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.620]   over the next five years is doable,
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.220]   but it's not always easy.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.760]   Like people who are new to investing
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.600]   might think that's crazy
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.060]   because it's been so easy lately.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.040]   But most of the time,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.840]   like doubling your money in the stock market
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.480]   takes a lot of work and a lot of patience
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.240]   and a lot of just like sticking it through.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   But lowering your expenses
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.220]   is so much more in your control
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.120]   'cause you have no control
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.920]   of what the stock market's gonna do next.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.480]   But you do have control over how big your ego is
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.400]   in terms of how much you need to flash
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.480]   and show the world how much money you have
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   through the cars you're driving
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.420]   and the clothes you're wearing
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.600]   and the vacations that you're posting on Instagram.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.080]   Controlling that side is so much more in your control
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.200]   than assuming that you can have any control
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.920]   of what the stock market's gonna do next.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.600]   So it's just, it's not that one side
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.080]   is more important than the other.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.960]   It's just, if you're looking at the odds of success
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.820]   and you're trying to find the highest odds
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.320]   of like what's the lever I can pull
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.780]   that when I pull it, it's actually gonna make a difference.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.640]   For the huge majority of people,
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.200]   it's on the spending side of the equation.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.600]   And that's how they can really move the needle
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.420]   in their life.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.640]   And things that are more in your control
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.600]   are just so much more valuable.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.360]   Like the expected value of something like that
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.560]   is so much more valuable than for most people
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.080]   to try to increase their income by a significant amount.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.520]   So why don't people wanna do that?
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.360]   I think there's two reasons.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.440]   One is what we talked about before,
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.560]   which is that when most people gain more income,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.500]   they instantly wanna say, how can I spend this?
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.320]   Because their view of money is the sole purpose of money
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.560]   is to buy stuff.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.120]   Which seems like a really rational statement.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.840]   That's what money is, money is to buy stuff.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.680]   That's what it's for.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.280]   That seems so obvious.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.480]   And even when I say it, I'm kinda like,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.040]   yeah, of course that's what it's for.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.520]   And so most people stop right there
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.720]   and they say, well, if I just got $1,000 raise,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.360]   I'm gonna go spend $1,000 'cause that's what money's for.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.960]   But I think once you view money as,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.740]   oh, actually this can give you independence
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.200]   if you save it and invest it and this gives you wealth,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.320]   now you have control of your time,
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.380]   now you can do whatever you want.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.480]   Now when life throws a curve ball at you,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.680]   you're gonna be okay.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.840]   Then you start thinking about it a little bit different.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.240]   And so if you don't have that little nuance
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.520]   on what money can do for you
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.960]   and the independence side of it,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.200]   it makes savings much harder.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.520]   Because you're saving money and you're saving,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.960]   what's the point of this?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.200]   What am I saving it for if I'm not gonna spend it?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.840]   That's how a lot of people think.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.440]   Once you view it as, I'm saving this
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.840]   so I can have control over my time,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.640]   so I can live whatever life I want,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.920]   then I think it becomes quite a bit easier to save.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.560]   So that's always the lens that I viewed it through
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.720]   when saving for myself.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.880]   - Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.600]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.440]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.040]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.560]   without our consent.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.520]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.480]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.320]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.880]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.040]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.880]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.000]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.240]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.560]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.520]   for this episode.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.480]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.600]   and remove your personal information
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.360]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.480]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.120]   and get that removed as well.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.080]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.440]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.760]   in their first two years.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.800]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.760]   for their customers.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.320]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.360]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.880]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.840]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.040]   Did you know that some common symptoms
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.200]   of electrolyte deficiency include headaches, muscle cramps,
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.120]   fatigue, and sleeplessness?
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.040]   I feel like I'm late to the electrolyte game,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.520]   but after getting pretty dehydrated earlier this year
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.560]   and discovering Element, I am fully on board.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.800]   Element is an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.600]   and has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.720]   That means lots of salt with no sugar,
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.640]   and I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.800]   Honestly, I can't believe I never realized
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.080]   how important it can be to replenish electrolytes,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.960]   whether that's after having a few cocktails,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.840]   working out, not feeling well,
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.240]   or just to keep up with an active lifestyle.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.160]   And when it comes to how you get those electrolytes,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.920]   Element was an easy choice for me
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.840]   because there's no sugar, no coloring,
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.800]   no artificial ingredients or fillers,
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.500]   and on top of that, it tastes so good.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.840]   My personal favorite is the Lemon Habanero,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.920]   and Amy's is Watermelon.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.840]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.560]   to exercise enthusiasts to everyday parents
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.520]   and even podcast hosts like me.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.180]   And if you're not sure if it's for you,
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.920]   don't worry because Element offers no questions asked refunds
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.960]   so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.640]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.960]   with any purchase.

[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   free with any Element order.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.080]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors

[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.040]   That's L-M-N-T.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.620]   - Is there anything you've learned about psychology
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.660]   that helps people who have gone through that exercise
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.380]   of, "Yeah, I do want my freedom,"
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.800]   but struggle with stopping themselves from wanting more,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.460]   stopping themselves from wanting the nicer car,
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.340]   the nicer house, or whatever it is?
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.680]   Is there any tactics that people can use
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.240]   to stop that feeling?
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.540]   - No, I don't know if there's any specific tactics.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.260]   It's like the most natural thing in the world.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.400]   And even myself, who writes a book about this topic,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.360]   of course it's tempting for my wife and I
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.280]   to say, "Hey, we gained a little bit of income
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.440]   "from this or that.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.860]   "Should we go buy a nicer?"
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.100]   That temptation never goes away, ever.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.960]   I think it's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.300]   It's natural from a social level
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.740]   to try to show your friends and your coworkers
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.940]   and your spouse or your potential future spouses
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.580]   that you've made it in the world.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.980]   That's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.020]   Take your peacock feathers and flay them up
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.160]   and be like, "Hey, look at me.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.380]   "This is what I've done."
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.860]   That's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.020]   And even if you're not thinking about it
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.840]   through the social sense,
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.620]   the idea that nicer stuff will make you happier
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.940]   is true to some extent.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.660]   We just overestimate how much it's going to be true.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.540]   So it's a really difficult thing.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.260]   I think that the people who find a way to do it
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.780]   are just the ones who are just totally comfortable
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.580]   in themselves and who they are
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.340]   and don't feel a lot of obligation or urge
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.180]   to try to gain the social ladder.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.500]   They're comfortable with their friends and their spouses
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.540]   or their significant others.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.220]   They're totally comfortable with that.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.220]   And those people love them and appreciate them.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.700]   And they just don't feel that much need
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.920]   to climb the social ladder.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.100]   They're happy where they are.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.380]   Those are the people that can really gain total control
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.660]   over their financial lives
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.820]   because they're not on just constant hamster wheel
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.460]   of trying to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.060]   And the Joneses thing is such a huge problem
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.940]   because there are a lot of Joneses
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.780]   and some of them are extremely wealthy.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.740]   So no matter how much money you gain,
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.400]   there's always someone who's making more than you.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.020]   And if you're making 50 grand
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.340]   and then you're looking up to the person
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.380]   who's making 100.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.500]   And then once you make 100,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.100]   you're looking up to the guy who's making 200.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.960]   And that keeps going forever.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.500]   That never ends.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.580]   So like I use the example in the book of like,
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.340]   if you are a professional baseball player,
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.180]   the minimum wage is about half a million dollars per year,
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.220]   which by any definition is rich.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.140]   Like in the United States,
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.260]   you make half a million dollars a year,
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.580]   like you're crushing it.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.420]   You're like, congratulations, you made it, you're rich.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.900]   But I guarantee you that every minimum wage baseball player
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.700]   in professional baseball does not consider themselves rich
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.660]   because there's people on their team
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.340]   who make $10 million a year.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.620]   And the people who make 10 million
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.460]   might not feel that great
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.020]   'cause they're looking up to the players
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.100]   who make 30 million.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.300]   And the guy who makes 30 million
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.460]   is looking at the hedge fund manager
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.340]   who's making 500 million.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.020]   And the hedge fund manager who makes 500 million
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.460]   is looking at Jeff Bezos.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.500]   Like that never ends.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.020]   So people, once you realize,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.300]   like I use this quote in the book of a friend of mine
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.940]   who goes to Vegas every year.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.080]   One year he walked in and he asked the dealer,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.860]   he said, "Hey, what games do you play, Mr. Dealer?"
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.740]   Like in Vegas, what games do you play?
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.740]   And he said, "I don't play any games."
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.700]   He said, "The only game that you can win in Vegas
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.840]   "is not playing.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.460]   "That's the only way that you can win in Vegas
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.460]   "is to like walk out of the casino."
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.180]   And I feel like it's the same with that,
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.860]   like climbing the social ladder.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.180]   There's no end point.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.020]   So people are like, I'm on this mission to win the game.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.540]   And it's like, no, you're never gonna win the game.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.940]   The game never ends.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.420]   So when you realize the game never ends
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.740]   and it can't be beat,
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.700]   then for myself, it's different for everyone,
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.540]   but for myself, it's like,
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.700]   well, if you can't beat the game,
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.840]   I don't wanna play the game.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.300]   I'm gonna try hard as I can not to play the game.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.080]   That's not a tip or a trick or a tactic in how to do it.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.700]   It's just a little bit different way of thinking about it.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.500]   I think it's such an ingrained part of human nature
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.100]   that it's never gonna be the point
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.860]   where the majority of people will be able to achieve it.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.460]   If you're mindful about the forces
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.140]   that are pushing you away from happiness with your money,
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.280]   maybe it's a little bit easier to wrap your head around.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.780]   - Do you think people can go too far to the other end?
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.500]   You mentioned the fire movement,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.460]   which I was actually in a documentary
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.540]   about the fire movement called "Playing with Fire."
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.900]   And I remember someone mentioning
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.980]   in the process of talking with lots of people
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.780]   that there's some people that like to wash their tinfoil,
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.940]   some extreme things to save small amounts of money.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.940]   And I sometimes ask, and I've asked myself this question,
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.060]   it's like, can you go too far in that direction
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.840]   and end up with all of this money
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.980]   that gives you all this freedom,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.620]   but you spent so many years not actually enjoying life?
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.020]   And what happens when you go too far?
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.420]   - I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.260]   And I think the biggest one
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.420]   is if you create this incredible frugal lifestyle
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.700]   and it turns off your friends and families
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.940]   and significant others in a way
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.820]   that they start rejecting you for it.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.420]   That's what people overlook.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.940]   So people are like, they might be being honest
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.660]   with themselves when they say,
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.020]   "I would be happy living off of $4,000 a year,"
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.820]   whatever it is, and they're honest with themselves,
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.080]   but their friends aren't, their spouse isn't,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.460]   their boyfriend and girlfriend isn't.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.980]   And then all of a sudden, this other part of your life
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.700]   that was probably the single most important part
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.900]   of your life, the people around you,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.240]   your friends and families that you love
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.660]   start rejecting you for it.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.460]   I've seen that happen a number of times,
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.900]   and it's devastating to the people
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.420]   because they're like, "Look, I was honest
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.420]   "that I could live this life and be happy,
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.220]   "but these people who I loved weren't on the same page,
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.820]   "and now I've ruined my life over it."
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.760]   That's the biggest risk in these things
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.540]   is that you create an extreme plan that you're okay with,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.380]   but other people are not.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.220]   And it's a hard thing to wrap your head around.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.400]   And I think there are also a lot of people
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.180]   that go down a path that is fun for a while, but gets old.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.200]   It's fun to be super frugal for 12 months,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.920]   but after three or four years, you're kind of over it,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.060]   but it's become part of your identity,
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.140]   especially when there's a name behind it, the fire movement.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.540]   Like, I'm in the fire club, it's a tribe.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.160]   And then sort of break off from the tribe
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.660]   is really difficult.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.180]   So once it becomes an ingrained part of your identity,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.260]   I think people find it hard to move on from,
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.180]   even if they're ready to move on from it.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.760]   Yeah, no matter how deep you go down the path
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.200]   of saving and frugality, I think at the end of the day,
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.880]   you talked earlier, it's two sides of an equation.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.560]   The money comes in, the money goes out,
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.740]   that's what you save.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.840]   So I do still think it's important to think about
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   what you do with the money you save.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.200]   And when it comes to investing,
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.620]   I like to contrast athletes and investors.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.480]   And it got me thinking,
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.520]   I have a lot of friends who played sports in college.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.040]   They all knew it was really hard to be a pro athlete.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   So most of them chose other careers.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   And I talked to those same people.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.000]   Who know that most active investors underperform,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.400]   and yet all of them are always trying to invest
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.920]   and beat the market and pick stocks
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.160]   and compare things on what's the return.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.480]   Why are people so rational in some areas
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.400]   and totally irrational when it comes to
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.080]   their abilities with money in the markets?
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.280]   I think there's a really easy answer to that question.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.300]   And that's, in professional sports,
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.320]   it's impossible to make it to the NFL by luck.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.360]   You have to be skilled, you have to be physically skilled,
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.220]   legitimately skilled to make it there.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.980]   But it is possible, and happens all the time,
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.200]   that people can be successful in the stock market
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.440]   by luck alone.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.320]   So the fact that it's even possible
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.920]   is why people go into it.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.400]   And a lot of them will just fool themselves.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.120]   Maybe they had some sort of beginner's luck,
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.600]   they opened up a Robin Hood account
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.680]   and they doubled their money in six weeks.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.280]   And they think to themselves, look, this is so easy.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.140]   And not only is it easy, but I have the skill.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.320]   Maybe other people can do it,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.960]   but if they know only 10% of people can beat the market,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.440]   everyone thinks they're part of that 10%.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   And especially young men are the most susceptible
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.520]   to assuming, even if they know the odds,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.080]   like a lot of people think they're being rational
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.560]   'cause they're like, oh yeah, I know the odds.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.000]   Only 10% of investors who try to beat the market can do it,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.260]   but I'm one of them.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.240]   And since it's possible to be in that group by luck alone,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.800]   do you have a lot more people chasing it?
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.200]   The other aspect of this is that
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.000]   if you're trying to get into professional sports,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.120]   it's really obvious whether you made it or not.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.880]   You got drafted or you didn't.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.000]   Black and white, clear as day.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.960]   The huge majority of investors who I've talked to,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.280]   active investors, particularly if you're not
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.660]   a professional investor, you're just an individual investor,
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.200]   don't accurately track their returns.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.240]   And if you really ask them, like, how have you performed?
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.680]   A lot of them, if they're honest about it,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.240]   they don't really know.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.520]   They're not auditing their annual returns
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.960]   and comparing it to the appropriate benchmark every year.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.120]   A lot of them do it,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.540]   and maybe they think they're outperforming,
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.680]   but if they're honest with themselves
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.280]   on an after-tax basis, they're actually not.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.320]   Or they're willfully blind to it
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.820]   because they're afraid to accurately calculate it.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.760]   Because, and in the meantime, they like what they're doing,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.960]   and maybe that's, and that's fine.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   If you like actively investing,
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.440]   even if you're underperforming, but you love it,
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.560]   you like the strategy, you like the hunt,
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.480]   you like the analysis, well, then that's great.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.240]   That's a cool little hobby that you have.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.400]   No problem with that whatsoever,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.080]   but it's much easier to fool yourself
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.660]   that you can be a great investor
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.720]   than it would be in sports,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.280]   where it's just obvious, clear as day,
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.240]   you either made it or you didn't.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.760]   - And how do you help people who like that,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.440]   they're having fun, they might be making some money
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   or losing lots of money,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.960]   and help them understand why
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.480]   that might not be the best long-term strategy
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.640]   if their goal is to pursue this independence
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.040]   and be more confident getting there?
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.800]   - This might be a disappointing answer,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.680]   but I found that for the large majority of these investors,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.400]   you naturally end up on one side of the equation.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.040]   And once you're on that side of the equation,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.800]   it's hard to convert you to the other side.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.280]   You know, that's not to say that's not true for everyone,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.720]   but a lot of people, if you are a hardcore active investor,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.120]   the odds that you will ever be persuaded
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.400]   to go on to the passive side,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.480]   even if your returns are horrendous, are not that great.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.200]   I think for a lot of people, they're scratching,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.740]   when they're actively investing,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.580]   they're scratching a natural itch that they have,
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.440]   and that itch needs to be scratched.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.400]   And if they were passively investing,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.900]   they would have this itch that would drive them crazy.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.480]   And therefore, that's, so they're always gonna do it.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.560]   If there is a way that,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.040]   and I've seen a lot of financial advisors do this,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.720]   is they say, "Okay, I know you have this itch
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.700]   "that needs to be scratched.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.600]   "You need to trade, you need to actively invest,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.120]   "because that's part of your personality.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.500]   "Can we put 70% of your net worth
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.900]   "in a long-term diversified investing plan,
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.920]   "and then you can trade with 10, 20, 30%?"
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.240]   So that you can, look, you have this core
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.360]   that's gonna, this is kind of, you know,
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.000]   this is the big thrust
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.400]   that's gonna get you into retirement,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.320]   but you can still trade.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.800]   We're not gonna take that away from you.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.240]   I think that's actually,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.600]   like, if you're thinking about it rationally,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.160]   that's a wrong thing to do,
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.920]   because either one strategy works or it doesn't,
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.440]   so why are you gonna straddle both?
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.160]   But for a lot of investors,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.200]   I think that's the right thing to do,
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.840]   because it keeps them engaged.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.440]   And rather than just getting too bored
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.840]   with their investments, they're like,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.440]   "Look, I still have this pocket
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.200]   "where I can day trade and buy these stocks,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.600]   "and I feel great about it."
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.020]   So just giving them that outlet to scratch that itch,
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.860]   I think is really important,
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.520]   and probably the best way to try to,
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.760]   if you were to convert people from one side to the next.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.320]   But the other thing I would say here
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.960]   that's really important is I'm not a passive zealot.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.520]   I'm not one of the people who says,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.920]   "Everyone should index, and no one can beat the market,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.240]   "and you shouldn't even try."
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.120]   Those investors exist, but I'm not one of them.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.080]   I've become much less judgmental
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.740]   as an investor over the last decade,
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.540]   when I just realized everyone has different goals,
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.600]   different skills, different needs, different desires.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.120]   They view the world through a different lens.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.160]   Like, I view the world through the life that I've lived,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.360]   and only through that lens.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.380]   It's the only world that I know is what I've seen,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.620]   and the world that I've seen
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.380]   is different from the world that you've seen,
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.640]   and the world that you and I have seen
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.460]   is very different from different generations,
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.640]   people who live in different countries.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.840]   Everyone is different.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.600]   So to say that there's one right way to invest
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440]   is something that I probably used to believe,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.160]   but I've become much less judgmental as the years go on.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.880]   - Yeah, and you mentioned in the book a lot
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.000]   that people, even that might be similar,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.560]   similar geography, similar income, similar job,
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.080]   might be trying to play a different game.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.160]   They might be anticipating more money from inheritance.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.640]   They might be trying to earn some short-term money
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.680]   or really focused on a different goal.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   So it's interesting to hear how people compare themselves
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.560]   to people that might be in totally different circumstances.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.840]   - Yeah, I think about myself in college.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.940]   There was a social aspect of wearing nicer clothes
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.880]   and trying to put the peacock feathers up again.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.240]   When I was in college, when I was looking for a girlfriend,
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.080]   when I was looking for a wife,
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.880]   when I was in that market, that was really important.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.000]   Now that I'm happily married
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.400]   and my wife loves me 'til death do us part,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.820]   it's a lot less important for me.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.880]   So even myself, over the course of my relatively short life,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.300]   like the game has changed substantially
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.680]   in terms of who I wanna be,
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.120]   who I wanna show the world that I am.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.380]   That has changed substantially in my own life.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.960]   So if it changes within your own life in a 15-year period,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.980]   then think about people who are different generations,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.500]   people who live in different countries,
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.040]   different amounts of rich countries, poor countries.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.360]   Everyone thinks about these things totally different.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.000]   The other thing I would say is a couple years ago,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.920]   I was in Australia where they hadn't, at the time,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.440]   they hadn't had a recession in 29 years.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   29 years with no recessions.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.320]   So virtually every adult had never seen a recession, ever.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.100]   And then you compare that to the United States
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.600]   where 2001, 2008, we had these massive recessions
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.320]   that reshaped all of society.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.840]   And Australians, who of course, just as smart as us,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.860]   had the same information as us,
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.200]   they're the same people as us,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.060]   they had a completely different view on what risk is.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.680]   And at the time, Americans were very cognizant
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.920]   of like, the world can fall apart at any moment,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.040]   you can lose everything, it can just poof.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   And Australians didn't, just didn't have that view.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.720]   And it's not that we were right and they were wrong,
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.880]   that's not the right way to look at it.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.180]   It's just, we're equally smart people,
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.320]   the same people that have very different views on the world
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.520]   just by the dumb luck of where we were born.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.460]   - Like so many of you out there,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.600]   I absolutely love Notion, our sponsor today,
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.520]   and I use it every day for managing this podcast,
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.240]   taking notes in meetings, planning upcoming trips,
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.520]   and basically everything in my life.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.600]   But for the last few months,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.560]   I've been learning how to use Notion AI,
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.700]   and I can't emphasize enough how much time I'm saving
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   by letting AI do the tedious work
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.880]   so I can focus on the creative work.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.220]   Here's one example.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.400]   Whenever I'm brainstorming titles for an episode
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.120]   or questions to ask, I just ask Notion AI
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.260]   to help with the brainstorm,
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.140]   and I instantly double the ideas on the page.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.080]   Notion AI helps you work faster,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.820]   write better, and think bigger,
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.360]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.800]   And the best part is that Notion combines your notes
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.600]   and docs into one space that's simple
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.120]   and beautifully designed with the power of AI
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.940]   built right into the product,
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.160]   not a separate AI tool or browser tab
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.280]   that you have to copy and paste between.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.640]   You can try Notion AI for free

[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.780]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.460]   but I am back into it now.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.900]   And honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.140]   is that I just added some new workout gear.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.420]   And if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.800]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.420]   which I think is Viorey,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.220]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.460]   for this episode.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.980]   Viorey makes performance apparel
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.640]   that's incredibly versatile.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.520]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.780]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.400]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.340]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.460]   But it's not just for men.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.680]   My wife is obsessed with Viorey as much as I am.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.840]   While my personal favorite
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.220]   will probably always be the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.760]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.180]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.980]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees,
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.220]   and I'm loving them.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.020]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.140]   I went on a run, bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.620]   Their products are so versatile,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.880]   you can use them for just about any activity,
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.020]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.640]   but they're also great for lounging,
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.860]   running around town,
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   or they even have a few things you can wear for a night out.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.660]   Honestly, I think Viorey is an investment in your happiness.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.980]   And for all the Hacks listeners,

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.780]   Do you think there's any way that people can start to,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.740]   I don't know, force themselves to learn these lessons?
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.580]   I know anytime you're looking to start investing,
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.080]   you get often asked or find things on the internet say,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.780]   you know, figure out whether you're comfortable
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.220]   with a 30% downturn.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.260]   And it's easy if you invested all of your money
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.680]   and that downturn happened,
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.020]   and you got to know, oh, here's what I did.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.560]   But for many people, these things happen every 10 years,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.180]   or in Australia, every 30 years.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.100]   Like how can you start to understand your own tolerance
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.620]   for this before you see it?
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.980]   Or can you?
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.900]   I don't, I think realistically,
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.120]   you probably can't until you've done it,
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.300]   because there's no formula.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.780]   It would be one thing if it was like,
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.780]   oh, you just need to know the formula.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.940]   You just go read the book,
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.580]   and then it'll tell you what to do.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.740]   But nobody knows who they are
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.480]   until they've been in the trenches.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.740]   No one understands their own unique personality.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.100]   And there are a lot of people
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.320]   who are a very calm personality,
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.580]   even like an even disposition.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.540]   They don't panic very much in life,
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.580]   but they've never experienced losing half their money
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.540]   in the stock market.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.680]   And when they do, they realize that's the trigger
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.780]   that'll make them lose their minds.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.700]   So even if you are very introspective
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.820]   about who you are in general,
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.980]   I don't think people understand who they are financially
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.620]   until they've experienced some of these big declines.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.980]   And I've experienced 2008,
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.060]   I experienced March of 2020 last year,
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.460]   but there's a lot of things financially
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.380]   that I haven't experienced as well.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.860]   I have not, and you have not,
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.860]   lived through a period of sustained high inflation
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.900]   that hasn't existed since the mid, late 1970s.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.220]   So I can research that.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.660]   I can try to be empathetic with people who lived through it.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.640]   I can try to put myself in their shoes at the time.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.420]   But until I've lived through it,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.460]   I can't reasonably say that I know
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.580]   how I would respond to it.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.100]   And I think if we're being honest,
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.540]   like that's true for a lot of people.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.220]   Like virtually no one, in the developed world at least,
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.060]   had any idea how they would respond
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.300]   to a viral pandemic until last February.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.620]   It just wasn't something that was necessarily on our mind.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.400]   And I think a lot of people responded in ways
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.220]   that they wouldn't have fathomed before.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.540]   You know, it was completely normal before last February.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.660]   If you're on a plane and someone's coughing,
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.460]   99% of people, not a big deal.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.180]   Someone's coughing, it's not a big deal.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.340]   Now going forward, if someone coughs on a plane,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.660]   people are gonna lose their minds.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.140]   They have a totally different view
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.580]   that they never would have considered before it happened.
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.740]   I'll give you one very extreme example of this,
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.940]   and I have to preface this with like,
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.900]   this is the most extreme example.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.700]   There's a book called "What We Knew",
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.900]   and it's a book interviewing German civilians
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.420]   on what they knew during World War II.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.540]   During when the Nazis were in power,
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.900]   what did the civilians know?
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.980]   Not the guards at Auschwitz, the German civilians.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.800]   What did they know?
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.100]   What was going on?
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.260]   And there's this passage in the book
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.180]   where this German civilian said,
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.860]   "Look, when Hitler came to power in 1933,
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.500]   the Germans were fully behind them.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.420]   We were like, rah, rah, like Hitler, this is great."
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.580]   And they said, "Why?
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.540]   Like, I don't understand.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.940]   Can you explain why you were so excited about him?"
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.820]   And the civilian said, "Look, in the 1920s,
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.220]   Germany lost everything.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.700]   The economy fell apart.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.540]   We lost everything.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.360]   No one had a job.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.420]   We lost all of our wealth.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.240]   And Hitler came along and said,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.180]   "I'll give you a job.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.180]   We're gonna rebuild the country.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.460]   We're gonna bring back German pride, et cetera, et cetera."
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.160]   And in that situation where people were so desperate
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.040]   for anything, they looked at him and said,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.660]   "Great, that's my guy."
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.500]   And they're looking at this in hindsight and saying,
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.140]   "Look, when people are in a desperate situation
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.460]   where they don't have any money,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.540]   they lost all their jobs, they lost everything,
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.100]   people will cling to things in that situation
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.980]   that they never would have imagined.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.540]   You'll cling to the craziest person that comes across
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.140]   if he's willing to give you a little bit of hope."
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.340]   That's the most extreme example,
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.380]   but nobody knows what they're gonna do
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.440]   or how they're gonna react in the heat of the moment
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.920]   when things are really uncertain,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.120]   when you've lost a lot of money,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.420]   when you've lost your job.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.900]   When things are calm and prosperous,
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.140]   people don't know how they're gonna respond
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.540]   during those heated moments
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.060]   until you've actually experienced it.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.500]   In the pandemic, I work at Wealthfront
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.620]   and we have a passively managed portfolio
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.200]   and we have risk tolerance questions.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.840]   And we ask, "How are you gonna feel
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.260]   if the portfolio is down?"
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.480]   And people overestimate what they think.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.660]   They say, "Well, if the market's down 20%,
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.420]   I'm gonna buy more 'cause it's on sale."
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.340]   But one of the interesting things
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.980]   that happened during the pandemic
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.520]   was some people made the complete different decision
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.320]   and not because they didn't think the market was on sale,
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.860]   because it wasn't a 20% down.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.380]   It was a 20% down in the middle of a pandemic
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.420]   where some people are shouting from television
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.580]   that the world could end and half the world could die
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.580]   and all of these extreme things.
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.460]   And that feels very different than the academic exercise
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.140]   of if something goes down 20%, what do you do?
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.420]   And I personally think the media makes it even harder
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.220]   to know what to do because it's really extreme.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.060]   So, that to me was like a great example
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.080]   of the risk tolerance questionnaire
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.460]   isn't sufficient in isolation.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.280]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.700]   Because if you were to ask me, "Morgan, how would I feel
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.340]   if the market fell 30%?"
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.740]   If you were to ask that question,
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.020]   I imagine, when I'm trying to picture that,
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.940]   I imagine a world where everything is exactly the same today
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.020]   except stock prices are 30% cheaper.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.180]   And in that world, it seems like an opportunity.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.340]   Everything is the same except cheaper stock prices,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.420]   that's a good opportunity.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.860]   But that's not how it works.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.880]   The reason the market falls 30%
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.420]   is because the banking system is about to collapse,
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.180]   like 2008, where there's a pandemic
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.980]   that might kill your entire family.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.180]   And in that context, totally different scenario.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.800]   And that's why people are just in general pretty poor
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.140]   at forecasting the risk tolerance
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.700]   and how they might behave during the next big decline.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.540]   - Another thing, forgetting major market declines,
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.020]   just thinking of poor investment decisions,
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.440]   which I think right now,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.420]   there's this big rise of active trading.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.660]   And I'm sure you have opinions like I do
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.860]   about the gamification of investing
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.940]   and what that causes people to do.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.620]   But for people who are making decisions
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.020]   that end up being wrong,
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.180]   I think something I took away from the book
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.580]   and I've seen in practice is that you just will be wrong.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.700]   And I think something that I'd love you
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.180]   to talk a little bit about is how can people
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.060]   get comfortable with that concept?
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.140]   Which is like, if you're a doctor,
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.740]   you don't want to be okay being wrong 20, 30% of the time,
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.420]   but as an investor, that's okay and that's expected.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.760]   - Yeah, like obviously, like if you're a pilot,
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.900]   then you have to be right 100% of the time.
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.660]   Like you can't say, "Oh, I really botched this flight,
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.020]   but I got next time to come."
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.740]   But investing is not like that.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.340]   There's a thing that Benjamin Graham talked about
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.780]   in one of his books, where he said,
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.220]   "Investors need to understand the difference
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.540]   between a positive and a negative art."
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.780]   And he said, "Investing in stocks was a positive art
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.260]   because all you need to do to do well
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.380]   is make sure that you own the good ones."
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.740]   If you pick 100 stocks and 80 of them suck,
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.420]   but five of them are the next Apple,
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.700]   the next Amazon, the next Facebook,
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.020]   you're gonna do incredible.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.780]   Even if 80% of the ones you picked go bankrupt.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.220]   So investing is a positive art.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.180]   He said, "Owning bonds is a negative art
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.180]   because what you need to do to do well as a bond investor
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.480]   is make sure that you don't own any of the bad ones.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.820]   Any of the bonds that are gonna default,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.960]   you just need to avoid all of those."
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.740]   So it's important to realize is what you're doing in life,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.220]   and this applies to everything in life,
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.620]   like careers and friends,
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.460]   is it a positive or a negative art?
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.100]   Are you trying to find, is it just important
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.900]   that you find the one or two good ones?
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.620]   Or is it important that you really avoid
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.220]   the one or two bad ones?
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.300]   And investing in the stock market, again, is a positive art.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.980]   Which means that it is completely normal
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.040]   in every, no matter how you're investing,
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.220]   if you're an index fund investor,
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.500]   if you're a stock picker, if you're a trader,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.380]   whatever it is, that you're gonna make
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.440]   the majority of your lifetime returns
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.040]   from a small minority of the stocks that you pick.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.300]   Even in an index fund.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.580]   I mean, the stuff that's pretty incredible
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.420]   is that in a 40-year period, from 1980 to 2020,
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.660]   the Russell 3000 Index,
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.740]   which is an index of large stocks in the United States,
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.460]   of 3,000 companies in the United States,
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.980]   40% of the components in the Russell 3000
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.140]   effectively went out of business over this 40-year period.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.620]   40% of the components.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.360]   But the index itself had average annual returns
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.100]   of like 11% per year.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.000]   Like, the index did really well.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.340]   But 40% of the companies in the index went out of business.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.560]   And that's in an index fund.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.720]   That's not like a crazy stock picking strategy.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.440]   Even in an index fund, like almost half
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.000]   of the companies that you invest in won't make it.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.840]   And that's fine.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.720]   That's totally normal.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.240]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.160]   And the other example I've used in the book
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.840]   is Benjamin Graham himself was a very successful
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.280]   fund manager over the course of his life.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.680]   But 100%, and he writes about this.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.760]   He was open about this.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.380]   100% of his career success is owed to one investment
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.900]   that he made, Geico.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.260]   If you take his career track record and remove Geico,
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.620]   his track record is completely average.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.460]   And Buffett has talked about this as well too
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.300]   for Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.220]   If you take out the top five or 10 investments
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.020]   they've ever made, Berkshire's track record is average.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.140]   And so that's how successful investing works.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.100]   No matter what your strategy is,
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.020]   you don't need to be right all the time.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.100]   You just have to be right some of the time.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.380]   And I think a big part of this is if you invert that
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.940]   is that good investing is not about consistently
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.980]   making great decisions, because nobody does.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.820]   It's about consistently not screwing up so much
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.380]   that you're kind of pushed out of the game.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.980]   Like it's consistently making sure that you don't make
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.420]   these catastrophic blunders that are gonna ruin everything.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.580]   But if you could stick around long enough
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.660]   and make enough bets or just have enough annual returns
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.660]   under your belt, you're probably gonna do well over time.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.780]   Even if you're gonna experience not just some,
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.620]   but a significant amount of underperformance
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.260]   and loss during that period.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.180]   And one of the way to think about this
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.740]   was a study from Morningstar a couple years ago
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.580]   that looked at the best performing mutual funds of all time.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.540]   These are just cherry picking with hindsight
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.300]   what mutual funds had the best returns
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.880]   over like a 30 year period.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.540]   And the common denominator of the top three funds,
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.400]   I forget what the funds were,
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.020]   but the common denominator that they shared
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.540]   is that they spent almost 40% of the time of their life
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.580]   underperforming their benchmark.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:31.180]   So these are cherry picking with hindsight the best funds.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.460]   And if you actually own these funds,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.100]   almost half the time you are underperforming your benchmark.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.660]   So it's not easy for people to wrap their heads around that,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.620]   that tails drive everything.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.020]   That it's just the kind of the tail ends
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.980]   of the bets that you make and the years that you're around
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.820]   that are gonna drive everything.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.380]   But that's how markets work over time,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.500]   whether it's for stock picking
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.620]   or just long-term index investing.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.060]   - Yeah, the two takeaways for me is,
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.540]   if you're picking something that has the long-term nature
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.960]   of underperforming 40% of the time,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.900]   you need to be long-term in the way you pick it
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.380]   and take a bet that can pay off over time.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.660]   And you talk about compounding.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.980]   And I think it's something that,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.420]   as much as it's been drilled in our heads our whole lives,
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.180]   it's something that you still need to kind of recognize.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.180]   And then the second is that you need to make multiple bets.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.460]   I hear this in Silicon Valley a lot when people say,
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.180]   I wanna start angel investing.
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.380]   And everyone says, okay, well, if you wanna do that,
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.620]   you need to one, make enough bets
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.480]   that you might find something that succeeds.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.060]   And that hit rate is so low
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.580]   that you need to have enough money to make 20, 30 bets.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.100]   But you also need to have so much money
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.640]   that angel investing isn't your whole portfolio
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.020]   because you might not get those lucky.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.940]   You might not.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.020]   And so I think when you can take the approach
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:47.140]   of lots of things for a long time, that's great.
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.420]   But taking the approach of, I'm gonna pick one stock
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.220]   and try to make money this year, I think it gets risky.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.660]   And I feel like we've kind of gamified that in recent past.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.820]   - I feel like for all investing,
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.660]   what you're trying to do
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.040]   is just put the odds of success in your favor.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.740]   And the way that you're gonna do that
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.560]   in a world where tails drive everything,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.580]   the way to put the odds of success in your favor
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.540]   is to be, yeah, to be taking a lot of bets
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.720]   and to be sticking around for a long period of time.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.420]   The more bets you have, the longer you're sticking around,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.300]   the higher the odds
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.900]   that you're gonna end up owning the great companies
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.700]   and you'll be around during the years
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.740]   that they achieve all of their returns.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.900]   And you're gonna spend a lot of time
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.540]   where those companies aren't performing,
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.420]   the market isn't performing,
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.620]   but if you stick around long enough
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.260]   and if you have enough bets,
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.700]   the odds fall firmly in your favor.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.560]   - Yeah, one framework
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.400]   that a really good friend of mine gave me,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.460]   because inevitably you're gonna make a bad decision
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.660]   when it comes to your money.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.500]   He always asked me, he's like,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.580]   "Hey, but wait, I know you're beating yourself up
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.700]   for making the wrong investment or doing the wrong thing,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.400]   but did you make the right decision
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.140]   with the information you had at the time?"
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:45.980]   And in one example,
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.060]   it was, "I wanna make this thing
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.540]   a higher percentage of my portfolio.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.300]   And I chose a day to do that
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.620]   where the next day it dropped significantly."
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.700]   And he goes, "Yeah, but at the time,
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.800]   was that part of your strategy?"
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.640]   I was like, "Yes."
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.660]   - Well, then you made the right decision
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.580]   and beat yourself up
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.980]   when you make bad decisions with information,
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.940]   but don't beat yourself up
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.860]   when you make the right decision, but it goes wrong.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.680]   - Yeah, completely.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.900]   I mean, we only know one version of history,
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.580]   the version that happened.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.020]   And if we're just looking at a short period of time
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.980]   over the last 12 or 16 months,
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.140]   we know the version of history that happened,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.180]   which was the government came out
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.340]   with trillions of dollars of stimulus packages.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.660]   We created incredible vaccines
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.420]   that were distributed very quickly
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.460]   and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.960]   That's the history that we know,
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.880]   but it could have been so much different.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.120]   It could have been that
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.980]   Washington had a bunch of partisan squabbles
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.340]   and there was no stimulus package.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.880]   We didn't make vaccines.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.080]   You could easily imagine a world
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.740]   where economically and health wise,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.380]   the world completely collapsed last year.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.160]   You could easily imagine that occurring.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.680]   And if that world occurred,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.760]   then the people who sold their stocks last March
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.120]   would look like geniuses.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.260]   And that world easily could have occurred.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.740]   Just the fact that it didn't,
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.400]   doesn't mean that we should ignore the fact
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.960]   that it easily could have.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.600]   That's true for, I think, 2008 as well.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.160]   You can so easily imagine a world
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.880]   where after Lehman Brothers collapsed,
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.520]   Merrill Lynch and then AIG
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.280]   and then Citigroup and then Bank of America
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.920]   all collapsed as well.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.600]   And in that world, which so easily could have happened,
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.840]   we probably would have been looking at
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.220]   the second version of the Great Depression.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.880]   That didn't happen, but it so easily could have.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.540]   So I think, just to your point,
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.000]   when people make a decision
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.020]   with the information that they have at their time,
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.980]   based off of the consequences of what might happen
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.480]   in these situations in the future,
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   I think it's easy to beat yourself up
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.540]   because all we have now
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.240]   is the version of history that happened.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.080]   But I think it's really important.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.240]   And I think the smartest thinkers
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.520]   are totally comfortable looking at the histories
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.760]   that easily could have happened
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.360]   and how they prepared for them,
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.700]   even if in hindsight,
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.900]   it looks like it wasn't the best decision.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.480]   With the information that you had at the time,
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.360]   it may have actually been a great decision.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.500]   - Yeah, I mean, you wrote in the book
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.120]   that the most important economic events of the future,
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.960]   things that move the needle the most,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.160]   are things that history gives us no guide about.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.040]   They're unprecedented, like what we saw last year.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.380]   Knowing that, how do we use history
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.960]   as a guide for what to expect?
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.520]   You know, we always have the disclosure
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.240]   past performance does not reflect future gains,
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.440]   but so much of investing is,
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.180]   well, the stock market generally goes up,
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.480]   so we should invest in it.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.200]   - Jason Zweig is a great writer
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.040]   from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.720]   He made this point one time that
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.760]   it's not that investors don't learn from history,
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.880]   it's that they learn too precise a lesson from history.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.600]   So his example was after the dot-com bust,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.160]   the lesson that people learned was
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.740]   when the P/E ratio exceeds 30,
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.120]   the market is too expensive.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.000]   That's a lesson that people took away.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.420]   But the actual lesson from the 1990s was
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.780]   overconfidence leads to trouble.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.800]   So people learn, they just learn a very over,
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.560]   they just learn a very precise lesson.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.720]   And since they learned a precise lesson,
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.440]   what they should have learned was
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.400]   overconfidence leads to trouble,
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.520]   but they didn't learn that lesson,
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.840]   so they took their money and they went
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.600]   and started flipping condos in Miami,
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   or whatever it was.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.840]   So when you learn, when you look at history,
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.680]   and you learn really precise lessons,
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.440]   they're not gonna teach you much about the future.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.220]   Because like you said, the biggest events
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.120]   that's gonna shape the rest of our lives
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.320]   are surprises that you and I or no one else
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.880]   can be talking about today.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.720]   So to me, the way to learn from history
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.400]   is looking back and taking the biggest,
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.760]   broadest, 30,000 foot level views and takeaways
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.960]   about human behavior.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.360]   About how people respond around risk and greed and fear
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.920]   and overconfidence and surprises.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.880]   Like how do people behave around those events?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.720]   Not the very specific, granular takeaways.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.040]   I mean like, if you were to look at the last
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.320]   12 or 16 months, you can have a lot of specific takeaways
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.880]   about supply chains and we should have had more N95 masks.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.180]   The CDC should have had better preparedness, et cetera.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.120]   Those are like really specific takeaways.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.380]   And depending on what your job is,
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.000]   those might be good takeaways.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.800]   But for most people, the most important lesson
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.760]   in the last 16 months is,
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.400]   there are things that can happen in the world
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.940]   that you're never thinking about
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.960]   that can completely upend all of your assumptions
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.040]   about the future.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.080]   Whenever you're surprised in a situation
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.920]   like we all have been in the last 16 months,
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.760]   the best takeaway is that the world is surprising.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.200]   It's not to look at what happened and saying,
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.480]   how can we make sure this never happens again?
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.440]   It's looking at the situation and saying,
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.840]   a surprise is going to happen again.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.320]   And I think once you do that, then financially,
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.960]   it pushes you much more towards having room
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.680]   for error in your finances.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.400]   If I knew all the risks in the future,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.680]   I would be able to plan around that really effectively.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.840]   I would know that in 2023,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.960]   there's going to be a recession that starts in February.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.940]   So I'm going to have this cash set aside for that.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.360]   But nobody knows that.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.720]   And once you realize that we don't know
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.880]   what the future holds,
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.480]   it makes you much more comfortable being like,
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.640]   I have this big chunk of cash sitting here
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.960]   and I don't know what it's for.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.240]   I don't know what I'm going to need it for.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.920]   I don't know what I'm going to use it for,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.640]   but I'm confident that at some point in the future,
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.560]   the world is going to break in some way
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.320]   that I can't forecast or predict right now,
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.240]   but the world's going to break in some way
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.860]   and I'll be glad it's there.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.760]   Once you become just a little bit more open and flexible
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.560]   with that room for error in your finances,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.560]   I think that's the only way that you can navigate a world
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.320]   where risk is what we don't see.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.000]   - You started this whole conversation off
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.180]   saying that the basics of finance, the models,
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.200]   the formulas are what we teach in school
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.320]   'cause it's way harder to teach all of this stuff.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.500]   And you just mentioned like a lot of the history,
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.360]   you have to interpret it differently,
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.040]   which makes me question,
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.400]   is there a path towards educating people
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.140]   more about this earlier?
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.700]   Should this stuff be in schools?
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.320]   Should this stuff be in colleges?
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.840]   How do we help people learn these lessons
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.080]   or at least start to understand these concepts
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.000]   that aren't just formulas earlier and more broadly
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.320]   so that people don't make as many mistakes
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.080]   and are better off?
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.720]   - There's a German professor named Gerhard Geigerenser
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.760]   who kind of teaches the science of risk.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.000]   And he made this point that in school,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.120]   we pretty much only teach the math of certainty.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   We teach algebra and trigonometry,
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.760]   which are maths of certainty,
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.160]   like gives you very precise answers.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.840]   And instead, what we should be teaching more of
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.440]   is the math of uncertainty,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.420]   like probability and statistics.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.400]   And that is taught in school,
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.260]   but it's secondary to the math of certainty.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.840]   Like the kind of math that teaches you precise answers
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.400]   is that's the first priority.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.640]   And then if maybe in college,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.080]   you can take a course on probability,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.360]   but that's secondary.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.000]   He was saying like, that should be flipped.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.440]   We should be teaching kindergartners
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.720]   and then second graders about probability
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.080]   because that's the math that really matters in the world.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.040]   And you're gonna use on a daily basis.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.880]   Algebra is important,
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.280]   but you're not gonna use algebra on a daily basis
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.400]   unless you have some job,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.000]   you're a math professor or something.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.680]   99% of people will not use algebra on a daily basis,
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.160]   but 100% of people will use probability on a daily basis.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.160]   They might not know it.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.640]   They're not actually doing the math,
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.580]   but probability impacts every hour of your life.
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.580]   And the decisions that you make in life
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:48.700]   rely on understanding how probability works.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.260]   And we rarely teach it.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.500]   It's a math of uncertainty.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.940]   This gets back to what I was saying earlier
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.340]   about what's taught in school is what's easy to teach.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.940]   And certainty is easy to teach
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.980]   'cause you come up with a formula
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.800]   that gives you the right answer.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.380]   Probability where it's like,
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.820]   there's all these unknown worlds.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.940]   And by definition, it's like,
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.540]   we don't necessarily know what's gonna happen.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:08.900]   Those are harder to teach
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:09.920]   or harder to wrap your heads around,
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.940]   but they're what really matter in the world.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.860]   So if I were king for a day, so to speak,
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.900]   I think I would probably follow
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.820]   Gerrit Geiger Enser's advice and say,
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.660]   flip it around.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:20.660]   We should start with the math of uncertainty
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.580]   that really makes a difference in your life.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.500]   And as you get older and more specialized,
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.780]   then maybe we can talk about calculus and algebra.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.340]   - And since neither of us are king for a day
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.460]   to make this change,
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.380]   are there ways that you think someone with kids
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.240]   that are in school right now
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.580]   could start to help them learn these lessons?
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.940]   - I think if we're just talking about investing,
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.420]   if you start investing and you own a couple of stocks,
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.580]   you own a couple of index funds,
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.720]   and you do it for a couple of years,
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.420]   you'll learn a lot about risk just through experience.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.300]   You're gonna experience the market going way up,
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.460]   the market going way down,
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.100]   and that will teach you a lot just by learning.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.240]   You're in the trenches getting your hands dirty.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.260]   I think that's the best way I would say
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.320]   to teach people about risk and uncertainty
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.220]   is just being thrown in.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.020]   Now, a lot of investors who started investing
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.260]   in the last year,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.360]   all they've experienced is the market going not just up,
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.660]   but way up.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.220]   Like, that's what they know.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.520]   So the last year of experience
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.480]   has not been a very good lesson
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.820]   because you're not really getting the full side of risk.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.440]   You've only learned half the equation.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.300]   You really gotta be investing for a couple years
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.300]   through a couple of cycles
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.020]   before you're like, "Okay, I get it."
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.800]   And then you start viewing the bull markets as like,
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.100]   "Hey, this is cool, but this isn't gonna last,
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.660]   "and a lot of this is gonna unwind,
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.560]   "and it's gonna hurt a lot when it does,
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.100]   "but I'm okay with that 'cause I've been,
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.260]   "I've lived through this before."
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.180]   I think that's really the only way to do it
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:42.900]   is with your own money, your own skin in the game,
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.180]   getting your hands dirty.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.460]   - I totally agree here.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.020]   I wouldn't advocate for what I'll propose
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.540]   to be any significant portion of your money,
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.580]   but a conversation I had with a friend,
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.060]   an investor last week was about cryptocurrency,
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.240]   and he pointed out that one of the most fascinating lessons
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.400]   about cryptocurrency that he's seen
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.140]   is that there's such extreme volatility, right?
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.700]   You could go up and down 50% almost in a day,
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:11.900]   that it's taught him more about market crashes
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.380]   and bull markets in the shortest amount of time possible.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.340]   And it made me think, "Gosh, I don't think people
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.820]   "should put all of their money in cryptocurrency
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.500]   "by any stretch of the means, and that's not the advice."
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.820]   But if you want to learn through investing,
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.940]   it could be a way to accelerate your learning
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.900]   because it has just such extreme volatility.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.740]   - I totally buy that, 100%.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.300]   I mean, I'm in the same boat as you
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.140]   in terms of recommending crypto,
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.980]   but I absolutely buy that argument, 100%.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.260]   - Well, before we wrap,
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.880]   we've talked a lot about money and risk.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.220]   Are there any main takeaways that you think
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:47.260]   people should leave this conversation with?
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.780]   - To me, the biggest thing that I think
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.020]   is the most important part of behavioral finance,
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.940]   and is maybe the one of the most overlooked,
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.020]   is that in order to do well,
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.580]   you have to become introspective about who you are,
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.640]   and realize that you're different from me,
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.940]   and we're all different.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.340]   And the only way that you can really understand
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.700]   and master the behavioral side of finance
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.820]   is just really taking a look at who you are personally,
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.180]   not reading about other people or other people's situations,
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.140]   but just being honest with yourself about your own skills,
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.900]   your own weaknesses, your own risk tolerance,
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.380]   your own goals in life.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.980]   And that's different for everyone,
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.700]   and that's why a lot of people don't,
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.980]   like most people want one answer,
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.340]   like what's the right thing to do?
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.580]   And when you become introspective about who you are
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:27.140]   and realize that everyone's different,
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.660]   you realize that people come to different conclusions.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.640]   And what's the right decision for you, Chris,
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.440]   might be the wrong decision for me.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.420]   Even if we're roughly the same age,
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.020]   people come to different things.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.380]   So I would just implore people
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.520]   to spend a little bit more time
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.660]   looking at themselves in the mirror
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.860]   and try to figure out who they are
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.940]   and what their risks and goals are.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:45.820]   - That makes total sense.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.660]   And I'd like to end all these conversations.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.100]   This is a show called All The Hacks,
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.180]   and today I would say it's a little different than some
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.860]   where it wasn't kind of running through
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.500]   very tactical things you can do,
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.980]   but really reframing psychology and money
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.580]   as something that if you can really start
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.400]   to understand how things work,
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.820]   you could probably hack your mind
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.380]   to start to be a more rational,
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.220]   or at least a more reasonable, as you say,
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.540]   investor and more reasonable with money.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.640]   But I will ask, are there a few kind of like life hacks
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.020]   or in any genre for you that are things that you do
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:19.940]   that people have often commented are fascinating
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.060]   or interesting that you'd want to share?
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.480]   - I'll leave you with one financial hack
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.780]   that might disappoint you,
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.280]   but it's the only hack that works
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.420]   and it works incredibly well in finance.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.900]   You want to do well in finance,
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.280]   spend less money than you make and be patient.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.060]   That's 90% of what finance is.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.620]   If you can actually do those,
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.220]   you have a black belt in finance.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.680]   It's the only hack that I think really truly works
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.260]   in a way that moves the needle.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.460]   - Yeah, I don't disagree.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.140]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.840]   Where can people find out more
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.220]   about what you're writing and everything you do?
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.860]   - My book is The Psychology of Money,
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.380]   and I spend most of my time on Twitter.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.540]   My handle is @MorganHausel, first and last name.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.920]   That's where most of my stuff is posted.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.540]   - Cool, thank you so much for being here.
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:58:59.560]   This was great.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.240]   - This was fun, thanks very much.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:04.260]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.180]   Whether it was the first time you heard it or not,
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.100]   Morgan is a wealth of information.
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.140]   And if you want to check out more,
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.720]   his book and blog are both fantastic.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.300]   Like I said, if you have any feedback on this episode,
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.460]   especially around the idea of re-airing
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.580]   some of the best episodes from the past,
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.300]   please let me know, podcast@allthehacks.com
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.340]   or message me anywhere else online.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.380]   That's it for this week.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.340]   See you next week.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.740]   (electricity buzzing)
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.480]   (birds chirping)
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
