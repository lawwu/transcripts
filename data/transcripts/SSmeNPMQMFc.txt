[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Next one's a little different. It's a question about designing
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.080]   household space for better productivity. Nice.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.800]   Hey, Cal, big fan of the show. Calling in today with a question
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.640]   about household space and productivity. My fiance and I
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.120]   just moved into a two bedroom apartment. There's plenty of
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.920]   space. But what we're finding our trouble is, is how we set up
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200]   what areas are for what we're trying to keep the bedroom is
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.560]   certainly no technology. Our living room, we're trying to
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.200]   keep that the same way. And our other bedroom we're using as an
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.720]   office space as well as a workout space with a stationary
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   bike and some other equipment. What we're finding troubling is
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.280]   how do I determine how to separate my work time from my
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.360]   workout time? If I'm at the desk doing work for my career versus
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.440]   having to do some paying bills and all that, we really don't
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.880]   want to bring the laptops out into the kitchen or the living
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.720]   room area, but are also having trouble not when sitting at the
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.400]   desk thinking about work. Any clues or tips you might have on
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.080]   that would be appreciated. Thanks, Cal.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.840]   Okay, good question. So first of all, I think this is obvious,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.400]   you need to take one of those bedrooms. And that needs to be
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.880]   dedicated to Cal Newport related material is where you want to
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.560]   have a whole wall for my books, you want to have a whole wall
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.360]   for my planners, a really good stereo system for playing the
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680]   podcast with a chair that's just aimed at it. Like that should be
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.960]   priority one and then everything else can fit into your main
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.520]   bedroom. Now assuming you don't want to do that, which would be
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.280]   my suggestion. I have a couple things I'll say here. All right,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.560]   so you're basically putting everything work and exercise
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.000]   related into one room. That's not a bad idea. Maybe you could
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.280]   think about exercise as something that you also interleave
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   throughout the workday, you know, if you're working from
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.560]   home anyways, with your equipment, there are 20 minute
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.240]   rides, some push ups, like going back and forth between
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.320]   exercising and work is actually a pretty good rhythm for work. So
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.400]   you might not actually want to separate those as much as you
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.880]   think. When it comes to breaking up household work from other
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.640]   type of work. Small, I think it's the right way to say the
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.920]   small changes to the environment. So small contextual
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.800]   changes can go a long way when it comes to trying to change
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.520]   your mindset. And so what I mean about this is that you can have
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.960]   a slightly different setup for bills or what have you, then
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.320]   what you do in the same room for your normal work. And that
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.880]   little change in context can make a big difference where you
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.920]   can do the bills or what have you without falling back into
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.680]   that mindset of regular work. So like one thing you could do is
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.440]   have a very small desk or table that is separate from your main
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   desk, right? So you can imagine a setup where against one wall,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   you've built a long desk that both you and your fiance can
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.360]   both sit and you bring your computers there and you have all
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.000]   your files there. And then over in another corner is a very
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.600]   small desk. Kind of like they used to use if you look at the
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.040]   Victorian age where they'd have those stationary desks, where
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.480]   it was like very tall, with a very narrow desk in front of it,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.400]   you'd go and you would write your correspondence on or
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.320]   something. So these are shallow desks. You have something like
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.200]   that in a different corner of the room. And right next to it
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.000]   is the filing cabinet for your household stuff. It seems like
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   it's the same room, but that context makes a difference. I'm
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.440]   at this desk on my laptop doing email. Now it's Sunday
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.560]   afternoon. I want to pay some bills and take care of some of
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.960]   that type of work. I don't want to think about email and I don't
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.200]   want to think about my job, you go in that same room, but you're
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.440]   going over to that other little desk. It makes all the
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.800]   difference in the world. That's the bill desk that's different
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.720]   than the work desk. So I think you do that. You can get a lot
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   out of the same space. The other contextual cues you can do is
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.400]   with lighting and music. Okay, when I'm doing deep work in this
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.200]   desk, I have the lights low except for one bright spot on my
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.160]   desk. When I'm doing email, I have the lights higher. When I'm
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.840]   doing exercising, we do something different, right? Those
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.560]   type of cues can matter as well. So small cues, give your mind
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.040]   what they need to know that this is a different context than this
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.600]   even if you're in the same physical space. So I think
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   that's a good idea. The final thing I would suggest is be in
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.400]   the habit of using that office is where your phones go. So I'm
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.080]   a big proponent of what I call the phone for your method, which
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.680]   says when you're at home, you do not keep your phone with you in
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.320]   your pocket. Just like 25 years ago, you didn't just pick up
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.440]   your old fashioned telephone with a very wide, long wire,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.800]   just walk with you wherever you went in the house carrying this
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.520]   phone with you, that'd be eccentric. But we do that with
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.120]   our portable phones. And so it's always there for distraction. So
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.680]   I say, when you come home, your phone's going to a set place,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.800]   you plug them in, and you charge them. If you need to make a call,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.560]   you go there. If you need to text someone, you go there. If
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   someone's calling you, you go there. If you want to see if
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.880]   someone texted there, you go there. If you want to look
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.240]   something up, you go there. And that's where your phone is. It's
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.600]   not with you as a default distraction. I call it the phone
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   for your method, because if you're in a house, you might
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.280]   have a foyer by your front door, it's a good place for it. You
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.400]   have a two bedroom apartment, use that one apartment, that one
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.480]   room for it. Go in there, we plug in our phones, we can put
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.720]   the ringer on high, so we'll hear it, you know, if someone's
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.320]   calling or something. And that's where we go to use our phone.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.360]   That is, I think, a great, I think that's a great setup. We
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.200]   have a living room and a bedroom that you don't look at your
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.720]   phone and you don't do email and you don't do work in and then
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.880]   you have this multi purpose room, where you have exercising
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.240]   in there. You have your main work in there. You have your
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.760]   phone interaction in there. You have your household admin like
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.960]   Bill Payne in there. You have your Cal Newport shrine in there
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.920]   that takes up most of the room. And the context is just slightly
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.480]   different between all of those different things. And so when
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.440]   you're switching from one thing to the other, your mind knows
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.880]   it's different. And it doesn't invade it all into the other
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.240]   parts of your life. I think you do that you're going to have a
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.080]   great setup for your house. And you're really would be taking
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.400]   advantage of the way your brain actually works. All right. We
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.280]   should have a shrine we kind of we don't have a shrine in here,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.400]   Jesse, but we do have some various things that fans have
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.880]   sent us that maybe to the outside eye is a little bit
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.040]   shriney.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.560]   Give your bookshelf.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.720]   I have the bookshelf, but I only have I don't have all my books
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.040]   up there yet. Because I ran out of shelves and I got too lazy to
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.120]   buy to buy more. But we have someone sent us a like a comic
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.640]   book artist did a an illustration of me as a
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.080]   superhero. Like heavily muscled. You've seen that out by the
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.600]   refrigerator. And then a class I gave a talk to they do like a
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   lot of original illustrations about me and my life like
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.720]   hand-drawn illustrations, the ones I have on the wall. Yeah,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.400]   yeah. In the main room. Both of those are a little out of
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.360]   context. Maybe oddly shrine like, I think out of context,
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.040]   that might be weird. But the idea was here in the HQ, we're
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.440]   going to put it up in a way brings up another issue. People
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.600]   are asking for a look inside the HQ video. So so here's the
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   here's what we should do. We're going to do. Yeah. But I'm, I
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.320]   want to decorate the HQ better. You know this, right? I'm just
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.880]   bad about this. When you came, I had to buy some chairs, right?
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.920]   So so when you started working for me, I only had one chair. So
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.480]   that's what I did. But we still are missing a lot, right?
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   Because I've just weird with decorations. I'm lazy. And so I
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.240]   think we got to figure that out. We got to have a plan for it.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.280]   And then I think the video should be before after like,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.040]   okay, let's tour the HQ as it as it stands now. That's a good
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.600]   idea. And then we we do some work or hire some people to
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.200]   help us do some work. And then we here's how it looks after
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.080]   we're done. So there would be a forcing function because we got
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.200]   to get stuff on the walls. We got to get we probably have to
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.720]   get rid of those old desks and do something cooler. We should
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.120]   have better seating, we should get a good TV in there. Like
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.080]   there's so much we probably people want to see your board.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.560]   People want to see the board. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we have the
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.800]   whiteboard in there. You know, I asked my listeners wants to
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.280]   send me suggestions for the HQ. But I don't know, I used to call
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.440]   it the cave back then. And some of the suggestions were a little
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.600]   on the nose. Like someone wanted me to actually build a cave
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.920]   with plaster of Paris, stalagmites and stalactites or
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.200]   whatever. I was like, Okay, maybe, maybe we should not
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.000]   outsource this one. But anyways, we're committing now.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.360]   We're committing now on air. Jesse and I are going to Yeah,
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.000]   we'll put out some videos, we'll put out some videos of what it
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.960]   looks like in here. Yeah. And then we're gonna make it look
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.720]   nicer. And then we'll put out another video and you'd be like,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.960]   ah, now it looks nicer. And there'll be a huge shrine.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.340]   [laughs]
