[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   All right, Jesse, what do we have as our first question here?
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.000]   We got some good questions here.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   First is from Fork in the Road.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.660]   I'm currently working in higher education administration at Aurora University.
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.920]   My lifestyle is slow and I have a lot of free time, which I enjoy.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.380]   However, my income is quite low.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.680]   Many of my peers with similar degrees have moved on to data science or software engineering,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.200]   live in big cities and have fast-paced lives.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.840]   They are definitely pros and cons of both lifestyles and I don't really see a good way
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080]   of choosing.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.040]   Well first of all, I think data scientists, I think fast-paced lives.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.320]   They're just slinging hundreds, cocaine all hours of the night, pulling up in their Kawasaki
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.080]   Ninja motorcycles, slapping five.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.360]   The data scientists do it in the standard deviation.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.160]   I don't know, I'm trying to think what's on their shirts.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160]   I'm pretty clever.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   So here's what I'm doing here, Jesse.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.440]   This is an inversion, right?
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.840]   So we were talking about people who are working too much and wondering how they can maybe
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.480]   make that more sustainable.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.920]   Let's invert that with this question.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.960]   Someone who's not working enough or not working that much at all and wondering if they should
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.200]   be working more, but how do they do that in a way that's not going to overwhelm them?
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.440]   So how do they find that?
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.840]   How do they get to that mean we're looking for?
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.800]   They're coming out from another direction, but trying to end up in that same place, having
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.220]   the right level of work.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.880]   So as long time listeners know, my standard answer to any of these, should I change my
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.920]   job questions usually comes back to lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.040]   I say, look, you should have this clear vision of your ideal lifestyle, all aspects of your
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.960]   life, not just work.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   It should be tangible.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.040]   You can smell it, taste it, see it, feel it.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.960]   And then you figure out how do I work backwards from that to make it happen, given whatever
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.560]   opportunities, skills, existing career capital I have in place.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.400]   And then you sort of build a reasonable plan to get closer to that vision.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.040]   This question brings a another element into that discussion, which I think is important,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.520]   which is the notion of an income floor.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.220]   All right.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.860]   So lifestyles and lifestyle centric career planning are abstracted away from details
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.020]   of this is your particular job.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.580]   This is your particular income.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.140]   But we cannot abstract income completely out of these discussions because if your income
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.660]   is below a certain level, there are issues that could arise that will destabilize any
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.260]   aspirational lifestyle goal.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.460]   There's a stress generation factor that happens.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.900]   If you feel like you don't have enough discretionary income to handle the things that come up in
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.500]   the normal course of life, it is a constant source of stress.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.040]   It doesn't matter if, yeah, but I, my house nearby this rural university has a nice yard
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   and it's scenic.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.700]   And if you're worried about money all the time, that stress is going to outweigh that.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.780]   Also if discretionary income is low enough, so many of the different options you have
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.220]   for actually investing in and fulfilling visions for different areas of your life are going
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.380]   to be cut off to you.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.780]   I just, I don't, I can't take this time off.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.780]   I can't afford to do this.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.540]   I, I don't have the money to buy the mountain bike for my dream of mountain biking.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.940]   So there's something that I call the income floor, which is important.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.900]   And that's where you take, and I'm using this term discretionary income.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.400]   What I really mean by that is your income after fixed expenses.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.020]   So now we're trying to normalize for like how much does your house cost?
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.300]   You know how much, uh, you have to pay tuition for private school for your kids because of
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.140]   where you live, that's the best option, et cetera.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.340]   So that the money you have leftover, if that's below a certain floor, which you can conceptually
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.060]   figure out, then a particular lifestyle plan, we can think of as being unsustainable.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.960]   So it's like, you want to say, here's my lifestyle vision.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.980]   How do I using my existing opportunities and skills and options, how do I get closer to
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.340]   this lifestyle while staying above my income floor?
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.220]   And we want to throw that into the discussion here, fork in the road, because you said my
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.860]   income is also quite low.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.620]   So this is actually gonna be the crux of what you do next is figuring out does low quite
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.140]   low mean below your income floor.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.780]   That's another bit of planning you have to do.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.140]   How much money would you need after you pay for your housing expenses, et cetera?
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.560]   How much discretionary income do you think you would need to feel non-stressed and like
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.000]   you have interesting options and the various things that matter for you in your life.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.880]   If in your current job, you're below that, getting above that income floor is a necessary
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.780]   component of your lifestyle vision that you're trying to move towards.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.380]   Now you might find that you're already above it.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.740]   Yeah, you don't make a ton of money, but where you live is cheap and it's fine.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.740]   Good benefits.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.680]   You're not really worried about calamitous, whatever health occurrences.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.280]   So you might be fine, or you might feel that you're close to it, but everything else about
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.740]   your lifestyle where you live is good.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.740]   Well, that's fine.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.300]   You don't have to close an income gap and you can make a plan to do that.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.540]   I want to move up to this next level in the administration.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.020]   I'm going to do this thing on the side because I have a data science background and I'm going
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.180]   to do some side work and we can easily push that above.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.560]   Or you're going to have to make a change and say, you know what?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.260]   I'm well below it.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.980]   There's nothing I can really do here to get above it.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.500]   So I'm going to have to make a change.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.060]   So the income floor I think is really important.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.460]   If you do make a change, I want to assure you that there is a middle ground between
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.540]   being the administrator in the rural university and big city, fast paced, cliched data scientists
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.500]   doing Coke off the stomach of a stripper vision that we all have of you data scientists.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.700]   There is an in-between ground.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.680]   And how do you access that?
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.900]   What is the map you use to find the in-between ground?
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.820]   It's again, it's this lifestyle center, career planning augmented with the income floor.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.020]   If you have software engineering skills, if you have data science skills, you can figure
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.620]   out, okay, I don't need to make all of this money.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.820]   I need to get above this floor.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.820]   Oh, you know what?
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.860]   I could go to Boise and work at the tech sector there that's burgeoning.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.100]   And this is actually a pretty reasonable job, but it gives me above that floor and it still
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.340]   has some of the aspect I like of rural living over here.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.420]   I mean, you have a lot of options is what I'm saying.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.660]   There might be remote work options.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.180]   Well, I could take this remote work job or I could do contract work.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.180]   And you know what?
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.780]   If I had five clients doing contract work, I'm above the floor, but I could live wherever
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.660]   I wanted, but the income is better.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.100]   You have a lot of options.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.660]   And this is why I always come back to working backwards from your vision is because that's
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.500]   what allows you to navigate the territory of options.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.220]   Without that, we fall back on cliches.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.220]   We fall back on extremes.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.460]   Without that sort of guidance, we think I either become a lawyer or I become a teacher,
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.460]   right?
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.060]   That's a very standard Ivy League graduate thing.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.860]   Or you think I either move to the big city to be a software engineer and I have to somehow
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.580]   like afford to live in the Bay Area or I have to stay in a very low income administrator
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.660]   job in this rural county.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.780]   We think about extremes.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.940]   We think about cliches.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.700]   If we don't have a specific compass to navigate us through that territory.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.180]   So lifestyle vision, career planning with an income floor as a non-negotiable component
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.340]   of wherever you end up, I think you have many more options than you think.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.660]   You have many more knobs to turn with the degree you have to build that lifestyle than
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.500]   you might at first imagine.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.820]   Mr. Money Mustache sent out an email kind of like moving or he was visited San Francisco
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.100]   and talked about some of those issues.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.140]   What was his, he came away from visiting San Francisco saying, "The lifestyle here is so
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.140]   expensive.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   Why would you live here?"
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.400]   Or he came away saying, "I'm moving to San Francisco."
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.900]   He came away saying he did some research and he's like, "There's still a lot of cool things
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.900]   you can do in the city.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.660]   The food is actually not that much more expensive if you buy it in a grocery store."
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.180]   He goes, "There's a lot of free places you can go."
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.540]   And he took pictures of him in the parks and certain places and walking around not paying
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.220]   for gas, that sort of thing.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:02.580]   Here's my, I'm going to give a deep poll here for like really long time denizens of online
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.620]   culture, especially old blog culture.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.980]   I'm talking early 2000s here.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.420]   This reminds me of it.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.780]   Leo Babuda, Zen Habits.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.700]   Do you know Zen Habits?
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.700]   No.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.020]   So this was really, he helped kick off this.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.380]   So there's this online minimalism movement that really kicked off pre-social media.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.740]   So these were, when I was getting started, these sites like Zen Habits were a couple
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.740]   years ahead of me.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.580]   In fact, Leo of Zen Habits actually had a program where you could sign up and he would
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.500]   mentor you as an early blogger.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.100]   He mentored me for a while and gave me some advice.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.740]   So I remember being in grad school at MIT in the early 2000s, like 2005, 2006, reading
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.740]   Zen Habits.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.980]   This is when the minimalists got started a little later, but, and this was also the time
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.180]   of becoming minimalist.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.140]   And I don't remember all of them.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.980]   They all had minimalism in the name, basically.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.140]   Courtney Carver, I'm trying to think of the different names.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.060]   Anyways, it was this whole movement about simplifying.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.980]   And it really was, I wrote about this in my quiet quoting piece for the New Yorker a couple
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.460]   weeks ago about, briefly I mentioned for the millennials like us, this minimalism movement
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.540]   that arose after 9/11 during the financial crisis of 2008, that whole first decade of
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.420]   the 2000s was really millennials trying to grapple with work and life.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.780]   And it's, it's, it's when we were moving away from follow your passion, we were the first
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.940]   generation raised on that.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.420]   They're trying to figure out how do I put work to work on behalf of what I want my life
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.420]   to be.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.420]   Right.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   But anyways, Leo was one of the original guys.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.220]   And he, through Zen Habits was about simplifying your life, slowing down.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:47.460]   And he, he lived in Guam, six kids, was in debt and was out of shape and smoking or whatever.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.180]   And through Zen Habits, he began chronicling, he got in better shape.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.620]   He stopped smoking, built up this audience and wrote a guide.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.460]   I forgot even what it was called, but like a PDF guide and started selling it.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.460]   And that did really well by 2005 standards, right?
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.220]   Like today, when you think about someone doing well, we're like, oh, that's great.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.660]   Like Jordan Harbinger signed a $5 million podcast deal.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.020]   This was more like, man, I made $70,000 or something.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   Right.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.020]   But he paid off all of his debts.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.620]   And he was, what made me think about this story based on what you're talking about,
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.180]   is they moved to San Francisco.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.780]   All his six kids, he quit his job.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.140]   He could make just enough off of this and they lived really cheaply.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.260]   So it reminds me exactly what Mr. Money Mustache was talking about.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.460]   He wanted to live somewhere interesting.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.180]   So they moved to a row house in San Francisco.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.180]   They homeschooled their kids and just went to the parks and to the ocean and just walked
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.740]   around and just loved, their whole life was built around just being in an interesting
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.740]   place.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.740]   So it made me think about that.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.860]   He was living cheap and made a really cool life.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.460]   So he's like, if we're going to live cheap, we want to live somewhere that's fascinating.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.380]   Zen Habits, that guy was awesome.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.300]   You would read that and you would just be like, man, I got to simplify my life.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.300]   A good movement.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.620]   All the older, I have listeners out there who know what I'm talking about, but that
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.700]   was a cool little cool period of in our culture that then morphed in the fire culture into
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.700]   Right.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   So fire was the, um, fire was the followup to the online minimalism movement.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.820]   So fire was more like a geeky version of that.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.980]   So the minimalism movement had, you know, like the minimalist and Leo and Courtney and
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.540]   Joshua Becker.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.860]   And these guys were, they're kind of cool.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.700]   It was kind of, they're cooler guys, right?
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.220]   Like we're going to just hike with our backpack and, and like live simply.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.820]   And Josh and Ryan moved to a cabin for a while.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.900]   And then we got the new version, which Mr. Money Mustache helped kick off.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.740]   And now it was more geeks who are like, I've got my spreadsheet tells me that if I get
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.700]   a 3.6 return post-tax on my, you know, SEP IRA, I'm going to be able to retire.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.140]   So then there was like this kind of geek version of it, but it was all the same idea.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.940]   And then the fire movement kind of got shut down because I mean, it's still around, but
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.060]   they got super shamed.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.060]   Right.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.220]   So then they got super shamed of like, you guys all are privileged and this and that,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.380]   and they all got worried about it.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.580]   And so a lot of them kind of disappeared and I don't know what's going to come next, but
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   that's a whole other conversation.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.580]   [inaudible].
