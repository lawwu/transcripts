[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.540]   90 months ago, we started a little podcast
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.540]   called Ask Pastor John, and today we reach episode 1500.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.840]   It's incredible.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.640]   This is only possible, of course, with the support
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.800]   and the engagement of so many listeners out there
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.400]   around the globe.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.880]   Your prayers, your listens, your emails,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.760]   your suggestions, and your continued financial support.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.120]   Thank you so much for being a partner with us
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.640]   to make this podcast possible.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.840]   And when you mix all the play counts together
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.120]   from the various podcast players that people use
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.920]   and the APJ app that was developed early on,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.020]   plays from the website, and of course,
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.220]   all of the YouTube plays that have accumulated
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.880]   in recent years, if you add them all together,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.880]   we are quickly closing in on 200 million episode plays
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.680]   all time, 200 million.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.340]   That baffles me.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.320]   It's especially remarkable because as some of you know,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   we designed this podcast to cover us in 2013
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920]   when Pastor John was in Knoxville for a year.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.280]   We wanted a way for his voice to remain very close to DG,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.320]   and it worked.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.880]   But we had planned to end the podcast with episode 400,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.120]   but episode 400 was really the beginning.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.660]   It was the beginning of our launch into the stratosphere,
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.680]   and that epic episode, number 400,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.320]   really propelled a growing momentum
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.000]   that has just continued to grow year after year ever since.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.240]   So Pastor John, here we are, 90 months later.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.320]   Let's step back and ponder this.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.840]   Talk to us about work, especially how you work.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.040]   People look at your ministry and say you've written a lot,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.400]   spoken a lot, accomplished a lot.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.620]   What have you learned about your own personal productivity?
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.960]   Do you have any wisdom about productivity or creativity
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.180]   that you wanna share with us at this APJ milestone?
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.400]   - Well, I have thoughts.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.880]   I'll let you and others judge whether it's wisdom or not.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.440]   You know as well as I do, Tony,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.760]   that podcasts like this don't come into existence
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.920]   merely because of one person.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.020]   It wouldn't exist without you curating the questions,
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.320]   mastering the systems, editing the episodes,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.160]   serving them up to Desiring God,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.080]   and it wouldn't exist without the team of computer experts
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   at Desiring God and the spreading experts.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.440]   So I think first lesson, first piece of wisdom perhaps
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.640]   that any productive person needs to learn
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.300]   is that no man is an island.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.300]   We are part of a body and the hand cannot say to the eye,
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.800]   I have no need of you.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.600]   And if I let myself go down that road even further,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.520]   I hear the Apostle Paul ringing in my ears,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400]   what do you have, Piper, that you did not receive?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.740]   And if you received it,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.560]   why do you boast as though it were not a gift?
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.360]   And then I hear him say,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.080]   I worked harder than any of them.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.400]   Nevertheless, it was not I,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.360]   but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.760]   Paul is just so eager not to take any credit
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.080]   for his productivity as an apostle.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.800]   And if I keep walking down that path,
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.400]   I realize I've got a wife
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   who has been spectacularly supportive for 52 years,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.840]   never complaining.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.600]   I pause here, Cody, to think,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.240]   now are you exaggerating, Piper?
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.760]   My memory is flawed,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.360]   so everybody should take this with a grain of salt.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   But to my memory, I do not recall Noel Piper ever
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.200]   getting in my face gently or angrily
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   about my studying and writing and speaking like I do.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.960]   So I can't imagine what life would be like without her.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.840]   But I have been recently pondering,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.440]   especially since this milestone was approaching,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.840]   I have been pondering milestones
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.660]   and looking back over 50 or 60 years,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.920]   wondering how did that happen?
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.960]   How did books and sermons and lessons and classes
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.040]   and "Ask Pastor John" episodes come into being?
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.560]   And I've got a few thoughts that might encourage others
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.100]   who are on the way with me toward heaven,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.460]   and they want to be fruitful and productive as they go
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.760]   and not waste their lives.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.440]   So here's a few thoughts.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.920]   Number one, get a clear vision
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.960]   for why everything exists, including yourself.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.620]   Few things have been more helpful to me
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.800]   than realizing what Jonathan Edwards would call
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.720]   the end for which God created the world,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.080]   including the end for which he created me.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.680]   I used to carry around in my wallet, Tony,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.000]   a piece of paper that basically said,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.200]   "You exist to spread a passion for the supremacy of God
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.880]   in all things for the joy of all peoples.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.320]   Never, never, never, never forget it.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.840]   Carry it in your wallet,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   if not in your conscious head all the time.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.160]   Know why you are on this planet."
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.000]   That's number one.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.640]   Number two, it's been powerfully animating to me
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.400]   to realize that as a human being,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.200]   I am destined to be a maker.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.120]   Now I got this insight in college
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.960]   when I read Dorothy Sayers' "The Mind of the Maker."
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   God is the great creator, maker,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   and he created humans in his image
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.780]   as secondary creator, makers.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.320]   The Lord God took the man, put him in the garden
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.880]   to work it and to keep it,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.600]   and we'll see how that's making and creating
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.380]   in just a minute.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.240]   We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   for good works, good doing, good making.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.520]   And I'm not talking just about artists and writers.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.480]   I'm talking about every single human being.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   The Greek word poieo means do or make.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.500]   Now why would that be?
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.160]   Why would one word,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.840]   and Greek isn't the only language that's true in,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.960]   it's numerous languages that do and make
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.920]   are the same word.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.040]   Why would that be?
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.640]   And I suspect it's because all doing
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.560]   is to make something different than it was, all of it.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.200]   So we are all creators, makers in some sense.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   Every time we act, every time we do anything,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.920]   we make something into something else,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.520]   some situation into something different than it was.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   A rocky field into a garden, a stick into a spear,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.120]   a room into a home, a cow into a steak,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.320]   flour and sugar and fruit into an apple pie,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.920]   snow into a snowman, sounds into melody,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   fire into lamps and heaters and locomotion,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.960]   11 men into a football team, and on and on and on.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.680]   We're all makers.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.680]   And that truth has settled into me in such a way
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.940]   as to make me find tremendous pleasure in creating things.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.420]   In my case, mainly with words, sermons, articles,
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.140]   books, poems, "Ask Pastor John" episodes.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.820]   And if you were to ask my wife, she'd say,
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.980]   "Yeah, not just words, but messes in rooms."
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.520]   Piper has a low tolerance level for chaos.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.500]   I really do.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.300]   I don't like it anywhere I find it.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.320]   I'm on it.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.100]   As soon as I see chaos in thought or chaos in a room
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.420]   or chaos in the way the grass is growing
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.280]   or the weeds are spreading, I am on it.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.220]   I don't like to leave the world the way it is.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.180]   It ought to be a better place, more beautiful,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.260]   more orderly, more wonderfully fruitful.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.940]   So I love to compose things,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.300]   things that have a beginning and a middle and an end
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.740]   and coherence and beauty.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.660]   I have a love affair with being a maker.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.060]   That started a long time ago,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.800]   and I think it has to do with being human.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   Third, we need to discover and embrace with zeal
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.220]   the difference between sloth and rest,
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.020]   laziness and leisure.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.100]   I wrote a poem about seven years ago
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.140]   called "Pilgrim's Conflict with Sloth."
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.060]   People can listen to the whole thing at Desiring God,
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.220]   where sloth personified tries to lure me,
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.580]   John Piper, as I stop being a pastor
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.060]   and move into full-time with Desiring God,
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.060]   tries to lure me with the half-truth that Jesus said,
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.940]   "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden,
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.300]   "that I will give you rest."
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.620]   And let me read you a little excerpt from that poem,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.300]   how I answered sloth, because this is so crucial
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.060]   that people make the difference between sloth and rest.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.260]   So here's what I said.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.540]   "As my God lives, I tell you, sloth,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.160]   "He gives His rest under a yoke.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.260]   "His sweet bequest, blood-bought and suited
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.580]   "to the back of every weary saint,
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.760]   "the knack of all our plowing,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.180]   "Jesus makes the weighty burden light
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.620]   "and takes the yoke beams in His hand
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.640]   "and lifts and carries us,
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.020]   "our works, our gifts, and Jesus is the giver.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.060]   "Grace bought and powers every pace
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.580]   "and every enterprise.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.060]   "Sloth, we were made and made again
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.960]   "to be coworkers with the maker of the world,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.240]   "to see the world above and then to make the world below
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.900]   "more beautiful, to learn, to know,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.580]   "and then to make, to shape, adorn, compose, produce,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.920]   "and turn a thorn into an etching tool,
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.840]   "to write, to say what never has been said that way,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.500]   "to sing, to draw, to paint, to build,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.600]   "to stitch and weave until we fill the world with truth.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.720]   "For this God spoke and Jesus died.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.240]   "This is our yoke, our happy yoke.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.640]   "You will not take my work, sloth.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.060]   "We were made to make."
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.140]   So I know, Tony, and everybody who's listening knows,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.000]   there is a place, an absolutely crucial place
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.840]   for rest and leisure.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.140]   The Sabbath principle holds.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.140]   We must know the difference between sloth and rest,
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.560]   laziness and leisure.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.480]   That's number three.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.220]   Here's number four.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.960]   If we're going to do our work faithfully and abundantly,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.240]   when I say abundantly, I have in mind 1 Corinthians 15, 58,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.440]   be steadfast, immovable, always abounding
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.800]   in the work of the Lord.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.680]   Do lots of it.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   We must not be paralyzed by perfection and infinity.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.480]   Arnold Toynbee, I pulled this article out of my files
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.220]   that I put away in 1970.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.600]   I pulled it out and I reread it.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.660]   The historian Arnold Toynbee said,
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.660]   "All human work is imperfect because human nature is.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.500]   "And this intrinsic imperfection of human affairs
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.680]   "cannot be overcome by procrastination."
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.320]   (laughing)
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.240]   That is awesome.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   That insight is just so incredibly fruitful.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.820]   So many people fail to be productive
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.240]   because they stare imperfection,
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.000]   which is inevitable, in the face and they say,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.720]   "Well, I'll just wait another day."
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.000]   As if waiting another day is gonna make the likelihood
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.320]   of their imperfection gonna go away.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.260]   That's an amazing and wonderful and fruitful insight.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.580]   And then he said something very practical.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.300]   He said, "Without realizing it,
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.520]   "I had pitted myself against infinity.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.660]   "To extricate myself, I developed a way
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.400]   "for my own banning infinity.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.240]   "Instead of going on and on acquiring knowledge,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.420]   "ad infinitum."
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.620]   And oh my goodness, what a temptation that is
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.620]   in getting ready for Ask Pastor John episodes, right?
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.180]   Every question should have a book written on it.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.340]   Every question could be spent days and days researching.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.500]   Well, what am I gonna do?
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.120]   So he said, "I started to do something
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.080]   "with the knowledge that I already possessed.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.100]   "And this active use of knowledge gave direction
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.580]   "for the future to my acquisition of knowledge."
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.700]   And I think one of the main reasons
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.780]   that I have been as productive as I have
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.220]   is that I made peace decades ago.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.220]   I made peace with imperfection and finitude.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.460]   I have no illusions, Tony,
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.620]   that I will say the last word about anything.
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.140]   My job while I live is to speak the truth
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.780]   as I see it in God's word, as well as I can say it
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.700]   and let God do what he wants to with that imperfection.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.820]   Number five, and this I have heard from Arnold Toynbee,
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.900]   Martin Lloyd Jones, Jonathan Edwards, and others,
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.860]   namely, "Act promptly as soon as you feel
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.780]   "that your mind is right for taking action."
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.700]   In other words, seminal ideas,
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.700]   far-reaching, fruitful thoughts come to us at night
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.540]   while we're reading, meditating, praying, walking, playing.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.540]   And if you don't capture those in some way in writing,
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.380]   you'll almost certainly lose them.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.980]   So find a way to, quote, this is Toynbee, quote,
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   "Act promptly when your mind is ripe with insight."
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.340]   Two more briefly, and these two relate especially
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.400]   to ask Pastor John and the fact that we're at 1,500
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.780]   when we thought, oh, 400 would be crazy.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:38.520]   We need to be deeply persuaded that steady, small chops
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:44.840]   with a good sharp ax will most certainly,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.320]   after a few hundred blows, bring down a very big tree.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.240]   Yeah, I told Noel last night,
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.260]   did you know that we're at 1,500?
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   Asked Pastor John, and she laughed,
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.660]   and she said, just like reading 15 minutes a day,
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.340]   because she remembered the fact that for many seasons
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.880]   of my life, being a slow reader, I've said,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.860]   okay, I'm gonna read a huge novel,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.140]   I'm gonna do it at 15 minutes a day.
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.060]   And I still do things like that.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.260]   Take a little chop every day at something,
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.180]   and the tree is going to fall.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.720]   You pick up a good ax and you take regular chops,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.520]   you will make good progress.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.280]   If you have to see a tree fall,
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.920]   every time you pick up an ax,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.720]   you will spend your life on little projects.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.480]   There are great trees worth turning into beautiful houses,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.320]   which can only be brought down
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.200]   by a thousand small, faithful chops.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.580]   When I was in seminary, I gotta bring this home
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.900]   because this really wallowed to me
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.000]   when I was 23 years old, 1970,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.820]   Jeffrey Bromley was my church history professor.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   He translated all 10 huge complex volumes
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.540]   of Theologisches Wörterbuch zum Neuen Testament
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.500]   into the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.700]   10 big blue volumes full of Greek and Hebrew
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.140]   and French and German, and oh my goodness.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.940]   And he's a church history professor.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.420]   And I asked him, "Would you write an essay
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.260]   for our student magazine on how you work?"
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.960]   And he wrote this sentence,
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.680]   "It might be of interest to note
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.860]   that two and a half hours per day
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.740]   mean two and a half pages of TWNT per day,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   12 and a half pages per week, and 560 per year,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.780]   a steady average, which makes possible
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.580]   a fairly rapid publication."
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.280]   A fairly rapid means probably one volume every two years,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.980]   like 20 years.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.980]   So what a lesson for a 23-year-old like me.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.580]   Just keep chopping, keep chopping
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.500]   at whatever worthy task you have.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.940]   And finally, Tony, I think we should say to everybody,
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.940]   let your motto be the principle of the Apostle Paul,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.620]   forgetting what lies behind, pressing forward to the goal.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.620]   In other words, never get to the point in your life
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.800]   where you are more contented with what you have already done
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.980]   than you are excited with what is yet to be done.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   At every stage, 24, 44, 64, 74, 84,
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.740]   pray with all your heart, "Oh God,
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.420]   make the next season of my life
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.140]   the most fruitful season ever
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.040]   for the supremacy of God in all things,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.860]   for the joy of all people."
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.940]   So it's been a good run, Tony.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.620]   1500 is a good run, but now we start
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.900]   the beginning of the second 1500.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.580]   If God wills, we will live and do this or that.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.420]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.820]   I know I speak for a lot of people when I say thank you,
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.820]   Pastor John, for investing so much of your life
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.380]   and thought into the hundreds of hours of your time
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.960]   that are represented in these 1500 episodes.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.620]   And if the incoming questions are any indication,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.740]   we will have plenty to talk about until episode 3000.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.100]   - I don't doubt that we will run out of questions,
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.980]   but I do doubt that we will run out of life sooner or later.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.820]   But the Lord governs that.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.420]   - Yeah, he sure does.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.420]   And thank you for joining us today on the podcast
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.900]   for our feed, our archive of 1500 episodes,
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.560]   or to send us a question of your own,
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.500]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.460]   Next time we look at self-pity,
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.500]   how do we wage war on self-pity?
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.960]   That's on Monday as we now aim towards episode
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.600]   number 3000.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.540]   I am Tony Reinke.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.740]   Thanks for listening and for supporting us
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.340]   over these 90 months together.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.300]   I'm really grateful to God for all of you out there.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.220]   Pastor John and I will see you on Monday.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.260]   Have a great weekend.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:31.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
