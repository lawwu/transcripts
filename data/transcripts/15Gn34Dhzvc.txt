[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.680]   All right, let's move on now to a question from Mark.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.600]   Mark says, "Do you have any suggestions for how working parents can schedule their time
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.080]   to maximize time spent with children, given eight-hour workdays, fitness, and household tasks?"
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.920]   Well, it's hard because especially household tasks take up a lot of time.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.040]   Fitness, you can fit that, you might be able to fit that somewhere else, but household tasks take a lot of time.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.640]   Everyone's tired. If it's an eight-hour day, your kids were probably in some sort of aftercare that
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.480]   they're coming home from. They're tired, you're tired, you've just been working, you've just been commuting.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.720]   So set your expectations lower for the actual workdays. I think that is reasonable advice.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.560]   Two, maximize the weekends more. So I'm a proponent of be very wary about the instinct to say,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.080]   "This would be enriching, so let's do that activity." And you know, "That would be good too, let's do that activity."
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.520]   And actually, you know, I think it'd be really good for them to spend time with so-and-so.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.320]   It's the the allure of child-scheduled construction on paper. You produce this thing that has all these
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.480]   attributes you like. There's a real allure to that. But when you implement these crowded schedules in
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.840]   the child's real life, it's mainly basically people yelling in a Honda Odyssey. It's all this overhead,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.960]   all this stress, everyone is exhausted. And so your schedule on paper, this is just my personal opinion,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.880]   should probably be way more sparse than in the moment when you're creating a schedule for your
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.760]   kids. You're thinking like, "Well, they should probably do that and probably do this." They don't know.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.160]   They want to be with you and not be really tired. So that frees more time on the weekend, so you can
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.000]   really spend more time together. And then you choose your moments, I suppose, in the weeknights.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We do dinner together. There's build something around the bedtime routine. You know, I'm a big believer
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.080]   in having one outing per kid per week. All right, we are going to go, I'm going to pick you up from school,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.720]   just you, and we're going to go throw the baseball around and get dinner. Okay, me and you are going
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400]   to go to the bookstore on this night and get a book. And so, you know, some days are busy, you don't
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.840]   have time for this. But if a kid is getting, and again, I have no back, I'm not the expert on this.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.440]   My only expertise is like everyone else who's a parent. I have a bunch of kids and
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.200]   this is just me pulling stuff, you know, out of a hat here. So keep that in mind. But
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.720]   if a kid feels like they've had one serious one-on-one thing with you per week, and there's
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.680]   time spent with them every day, and they're not completely exhausted being dragged around on the
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.320]   weekend, I think that's probably pretty good. I think that's probably pretty good. I think you're
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   about, you're doing everything you need to do. And I wouldn't be too guilty behind it. Fitness, I said
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.080]   in the beginning, you can probably hack that. I mean, fitness really is a thing that, you know,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.360]   if you've got young kids and they're in school, I don't know, I don't think you can, it's optimal
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.480]   to lose like an hour of that evening time exercising. So I think you should steal that from
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   work to the extent possible. Just find a way to steal that time from work. Just go during the
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.560]   lunch hour, bike to work and exercise at the gym nearby before you go to work. Do it in the morning
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.080]   before you go. I often am exercising after I put the kids to bed, so I don't have a lot of time
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.160]   then. So I do very intense, high intensity exercising just so I can get it done. That's
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.040]   something where I think you can steal time from work. That's my other hack. Maybe not all my hacks
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.920]   should really reduce the steal stuff from work. That's my other hack is steal time from work for
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.160]   household admin too. I'll be efficient about it, but there's 30 minutes well deployed in the middle
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.600]   of a workday can get a lot done that needs to be done for the household. So, you know, hopefully no
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.520]   administrators are working. I used to use the first 30 minutes. I mean, there's no real workday
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.400]   for being a professor, but I would spend what most people would consider to be the first 30 minutes
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.360]   of the workday after nine, always doing household admin. And I found if you could do 30 minutes of
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.920]   household admin every morning before you start your day, the amount that awaits you at the end
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.240]   of the week or in the evening is actually much less. So this idea that when you're at work as
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.920]   a knowledge worker, that it's like you're clocking in at a factory and every minute you should be
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.120]   cranking widgets. That's crazy. There's ups, there's downs, high intensity recovery. So steal
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.720]   some time for exercise from work, steal some time for household admin, and then mess around with the
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.520]   type of strategies I talked about before. And I think that's, you'll be doing fine. You'll be doing
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.040]   fine.
