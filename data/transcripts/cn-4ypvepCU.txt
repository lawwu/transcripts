[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   For any card on Citi, you can only get the welcome offer every 48 months.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.280]   For some cards, it's 24 months, so look into the terms.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.440]   But you can repeat welcome offers.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.680]   You just need to wait 2 to 4 years to do it.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.400]   You can only get one Citi card every 8 days.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.320]   But it's a little confusing because that is what everyone consistently says.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.960]   Yet I signed up for the Advantage Business and the Strata Premier on the same day.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.440]   And then there's another rule that says you can only get 2 cards every 65 days.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.640]   I think maybe because I applied for them on the same day, maybe it got combined.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.980]   But I'm certainly going to wait 65 days before I consider adding that double cash.
