[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   Today on the show we tackle the subject of debt collectors and bill collectors.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.000]   I want to focus on giving you some tactics and some techniques that I think will help
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.080]   you and will serve you as you fight your way from deeply in debt to financially free.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:08.840]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.440]   building and fighting for your plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.280]   My name is Joshua, I am your friendly financial philosopher and fellow financial freedom fighter.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.120]   And today I want to share with you some tactics and techniques that I hope may help you in
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.960]   this difficult time of your life.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.200]   I have a real desire to help people who are struggling with money.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.440]   And I'll tell you what, if you want to talk about one of the most difficult times in somebody's
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.280]   life, just go to the time when they're deeply in debt and trying to figure out how to work
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   their way out.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.920]   And for the context of today's show, I want you to go beyond just somebody who owes a
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.520]   lot of money to – and focus on somebody who is deeply in debt and can't even make
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.400]   payments, is weeks behind, months behind, in some cases even years behind on their bills.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.280]   One of the most difficult places to be financially.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.680]   There's a weight of all kinds of practical problems.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.660]   Obviously somebody who's deeply in debt and behind on their bills is experiencing
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.760]   brokenness, the state of not having any money, not having enough money coming in.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.600]   There is intense stress that faces a person in this situation from all angles, getting
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.280]   phone calls from angry, nasty bill collectors, getting threatening letters from legal offices
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.160]   and from debt collections companies.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.440]   There's an intense embarrassment from being in this situation that somebody may face where
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.200]   my friends find out I'm behind on my debts and how do I deal with these things.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.640]   There's just intense stress on all sides.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.740]   If you want to make a bad situation worse, just throw in a bunch of unpaid debts.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.600]   For example, if you want to make a bad marriage worse, just go through financial stress and
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.480]   turmoil and have a bunch of unpaid debts and it will make a bad marriage worse.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.260]   You want to make a bad business arrangement worse, just go ahead and have the phones light
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.360]   up with creditors calling all the time.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.520]   You want to make a bad job worse, just walk into Human Resources and find out that your
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.840]   wages are being garnished because you lost a court case wherein you were ordered to pay
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.960]   debts and now your boss has to send your wages to your creditor.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.880]   You want to make a bad car worse, a bad car decision worse, just look out the front window
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.840]   and see the repo man coming and hooking it up and dragging it away.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.560]   You want to make a bad day worse, just try swiping your debit card and all of a sudden
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.960]   finding out that it won't go through because your creditors have just wiped out the entire
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.160]   balance of money that's in your bank.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.000]   This is the reality that a lot of people face.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.160]   What I find really frustrating about this is that I really hate when people are bullies.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.200]   I really hate bullying.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.400]   So I want to help you if you're in this situation to protect yourself so that you can stand
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.120]   up against the debt collection bullies or if you're helping somebody else in this situation,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.240]   I want to help you because paying bills and paying money is important.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   But sometimes there are things that are more important and I want to help give you some
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.200]   tools and ideas that will help you to stand up to the bullies because people who owe money,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.520]   a lot of money, have been bullied right into suicide.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.720]   They just felt that there was nothing else they could do and they put the – as the
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.400]   country song says, they put the bottle to their head and pulled the trigger.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.460]   I want to help you avoid that and I think I can help you avoid that by telling you how
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.200]   to take on some of these bullies and buy yourself a little bit of stress.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.440]   I also want to help you because for me, one of the biggest things I hate to see is marriages
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.640]   and families ripped apart by facing financial stress.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.040]   As far as I'm concerned, a marriage and a family is much more important than paying
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.240]   bills on time.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.080]   So if I can do something to help lower the stress that your family may be experiencing
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.840]   right now, I want to do that because I want to help you fight against the bullies.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   Many of the most aggressive credit collectors, especially credit card collections companies
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.280]   and debt collectors, many of these people are downright bullies and I find their behavior
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.160]   completely and utterly offensive.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.000]   Now the great challenge that I face of course is to recognize that sometimes there are many
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.760]   bill collectors and credit collectors who are not bullies, that are fair and who are
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.080]   in a situation where they're owed money and somebody has stolen their property.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.520]   That's effectively what it means when you don't pay your bills on time, when you
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.800]   don't pay your bills as agreed.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.280]   Effectively you're a thief and so I don't want to help somebody.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.680]   I don't want to enable somebody who's a thief.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.560]   I don't want to enable somebody who is fighting against their creditors and not paying their
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.320]   bills as they should.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.480]   I don't want to enable that behavior.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.440]   I want to stand against it.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.600]   So I find this a challenging subject to just talk about because of course I could go through
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.120]   and lay out some of these ideas and techniques and I could teach you very elegantly how to
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.380]   walk through the legal code, how to borrow a bunch of money from your creditors and how
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.240]   to structure your circumstances in a way that your creditors can't find you and that they
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.040]   don't know where you are and they don't know where your property is and I could teach
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.960]   you how to walk right through the bankruptcy court.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.140]   As long as you never admitted to what you're doing, I think we could figure out some schemes
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.080]   that would allow you to walk out and not have to pay the money back.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.400]   There are ways to do that.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.880]   And so I don't want to enable bad behavior but I want to protect people who are in a
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.240]   difficult circumstance so that you can stand up for yourself and so that you can effectively
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.640]   pay back your debts.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.400]   And I think most normal people will be able to identify the difference between these two
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   things.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.600]   There's a respect that we can see and we can usually see the difference between somebody
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.320]   who's struggling, who's got their back up against the wall for whatever reason versus
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.580]   somebody who's scamming and is trying to take advantage of the situation.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.520]   So if you are struggling, I want you to know that I want to share with you some ideas here
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.200]   that I think will help you as you work to stand good for your word and to work your
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   way back.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.920]   And I consider this to be very, very important.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.440]   I consider it a personal obligation to do anything I can to help the poor and the needy
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.720]   and the destitute in any circumstance that I can find.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.920]   And especially in the area of debt collection, I believe that's something that is very important.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.840]   In the Bible, in the book of Deuteronomy, as part of the law that's being given through
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.680]   Moses, there's some instructions about debt collectors and the rules that were placed
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.720]   on creditors and debt collectors in order to protect the poor.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.000]   Deuteronomy 24, verse 10, we find these instructions.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.760]   If you lend anything to your neighbor, do not enter his house to pick up the item he
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.980]   is giving as security.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.700]   You must wait outside while he goes in and brings it out to you.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.760]   And here, of course, we see the foundation of some of the respect for private property.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.680]   The modern concept that we have of the respect for private property is built upon this idea
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.200]   of not stealing and protection.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.680]   So of course, thankfully, in the modern US-American context, we enjoy some level of Fourth Amendment
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   privilege.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.320]   It's built upon this concept here of there being certain rights and certain parts of
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.660]   your life and your house that are sacred and that are protected.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.960]   And so if somebody is trying to come and invade your house and you owe them money, there's
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.320]   a level of respect that needs to be afforded there.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.640]   And then the next – very next verse says this, "If your neighbor is poor and gives
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   you his cloak as security for a loan, do not keep the cloak overnight.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.560]   Return the cloak to its owner by sunset so he can stay warm through the night and bless
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.360]   you and the Lord your God will count you as righteous."
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.840]   And I find this just to be a good principle to see that when somebody is very poor, we
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:35.280]   want to make sure that they're protected and that the basic needs are protected.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.680]   Poverty in this day – where I draw this inspiration from, poverty in this day was
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.760]   somebody who was giving their coat, their cloak, their coat as security for a loan.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.680]   They were so poor that the only thing of value they could offer was their coat and it would
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.880]   be wrong and immoral to keep somebody's last possessions, their coat, as security
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.680]   and force them to be cold overnight just so that you can have a debt being paid back.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.640]   So if you're poor and you're in a situation, I want to give you some ideas to help you
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.260]   protect yourself.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.240]   And thankfully, of course, you have a lot of protections in the US-American context.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.560]   The legal system gives you a lot of protections and I want to share some of those with you
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.760]   so that you'll feel confident in them.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.080]   On the flip side, if you're a scammer and you're trying to just scam the system, I
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.800]   want to really challenge you on that as well.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:27.560]   Before I get to any tactics and principles that you can apply here, I just want to recognize
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.500]   the gravity of the situation.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   So often I feel like we minimize – and I'm going to take just a brief excursus into just
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.120]   a discussion of this just for a moment here.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   Because I feel like we minimize the important things in our modern era.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.640]   We have a tendency to trivialize and collectivize things that are very, very serious.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.840]   For example, we often do this with say warfare.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   If the particular nation state that we're a part of decides to go off to war, we absolve
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.680]   ourselves of personal responsibility in that decision or in that involvement because of
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.760]   a sense of collectivism.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.080]   Whether we're participating in a military context and we say, "Well, this is what
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.080]   our orders were," or we're just saying, "Well, I support such and such that the
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.520]   country is doing," or "I'm not going to get involved with it."
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   Great injustices are committed because of the collectivization of the action.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.720]   When in reality, we need to take personal responsibility for those things.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.480]   We must stand and take personal responsibility.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.360]   We have a similar approach when it comes to money.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.160]   We'll often say, "Well, so-and-so, these big companies or these big banks did such
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   and such a thing and yes, it was wrong of them but we can't hold the individuals responsible."
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.400]   Or we look and say, "Well, it's OK" – and here's where I want to get to individuals.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   We say, "It's OK for me to stand against the – this big company and I wouldn't
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.280]   go to my neighbor and take their money away from them.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   But because it's a big credit card company, because it's Chase or Capital One or Bank
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.680]   of America, well, they've got all the money and so I can just go ahead and take the money
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   from them."
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   No, it's not OK.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.440]   It's not OK.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.520]   I feel like this is important to start out with, to get us on the right foundation because
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.720]   if you get the big things right, then the little tactics and the techniques are relatively
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   simple.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.600]   Oftentimes in analysis, I look at analysis in almost three levels.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.160]   There's the practical which is just the day-to-day practical.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.120]   There's the legal and then often there's the moral or the ethics involved, the moral
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   discussion.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.720]   It's nice when all three of these things line up.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.960]   Thankfully, much of the time, the legal considerations line up with what's moral and the practical
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.160]   considerations can line up with the legal.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.440]   Sometimes though all three of these are at odds and that makes circumstances very, very
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   difficult.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.840]   There are many circumstances that aren't neat, that aren't neatly tied up.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.000]   But please, I beg you, if you're in a situation where you owe somebody money and you've fallen
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.080]   behind in your payments, face it for what it is.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   I personally believe that it's – if you're not paying your debts as agreed, that is a
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:19.120]   form of theft and you need to take responsibility for that, full responsibility for that.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.480]   Now, why do I say that?
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.920]   Well, consider the situation.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.560]   If you come to me and you borrow $100 from me and you say, "Josh, I'd like to borrow
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.040]   $100 from you," and I say, "OK, here's $100.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   When can you pay it back?"
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.000]   And you say, "I'll pay it back to you next Friday."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.120]   I give you $100 and you go and you do whatever you need to do with it.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.640]   Maybe you wanted to go out to dinner and just waited for your next paycheck or maybe you
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   needed to do some – whatever.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   It doesn't matter.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.000]   But next Friday, you come back and you give me the $100.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   We're all OK.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.160]   I might charge you an interest payment.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.640]   You might agree to pay for that.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.920]   Everything is good and that's fine.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.220]   It's fine for us to engage in these transactions and that's what we do every day when we
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.960]   use the financial system.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.080]   We engage in a contract and both people go into that contract freely and they engage
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.120]   and they buy and they sell and we're good to go.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.280]   But now let's say that you come to me and you ask me for $100 and I lend it to you with
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.000]   the agreement that you'll pay it back to me on Friday.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.320]   Then on Friday, you come back and you say, "I don't have your $100."
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.240]   You say, "Well," and I say, "Where is it?"
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.240]   You say, "Well, it's gone."
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.800]   Well, here's the question that I'd like to ask you.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.600]   Whose $100 was it if you're in that situation?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   See the $100 didn't belong to you.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.360]   The $100 belonged to me.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.320]   Now you've taken the $100 and you've sent it somewhere else.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.760]   In an effect, you've stolen my property.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.480]   That's the situation and the circumstance that we find up in when we're in this.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.080]   I think it's important to get clear on it because if you get clear on the fact that
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.360]   you have a moral duty and an obligation to pay your bills, then all of the actions that
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:12.120]   will come from that will be – they'll flow easily.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.640]   But if you're not clear on the fact that you have a moral obligation to pay your bills,
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:24.160]   I think you'll wind up oftentimes pursuing the wrong thing and your life will be very,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.240]   very difficult and you'll wind up in the legal system and your life will be very, very
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.120]   difficult as I'll describe to you in the course of the show.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.640]   Most of the show is going to be dedicated to the tactics and the techniques and the
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   legal discussion.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.520]   We've got to build it on the right foundation which is you standing good for what you owe
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.960]   and you not being a thief.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.320]   Of course, we would acknowledge that there are different levels of theft.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.720]   Thankfully, our legal code would acknowledge this as well.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.240]   There are circumstances that are different than others.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:02.640]   It's one thing for you to go and to intentionally steal my property and never planning to pay
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.640]   it back.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.960]   It's another thing if you take my property and you plan to pay it back but something
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.000]   happens.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.800]   But there's still an obligation here and I think that we need to talk more about this
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.760]   because we often don't – we're not clear on this.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.640]   Because we're not clear on it, we justify a lot of things on different levels in our
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:27.200]   society that really bring on dramatic harm.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.600]   Theft can take many forms and each form is wrong.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.040]   It is immoral and wrong for you to go and to steal your neighbor's car from their
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.080]   driveway by hot wiring the ignition in the middle of the night.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.920]   It's also immoral and wrong for you to steal the car that your bank owns that you stopped
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.760]   making payments on because you fell behind and for you to hide it in your neighbor's
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.600]   garage because they're looking for their property.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.320]   Both of those are wrong.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   Yes, the intentionality of your actions matters, but they're both wrong.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.880]   It's wrong and immoral for you to steal cash out of your company's petty cash strongbox
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.760]   that's behind the desk while the secretary is out to lunch.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.800]   But it's also wrong for you to steal cash from a credit card issuer by using their money
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.280]   to go out and buy things that you use to fill up your house and then not pay the credit
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.960]   card company back as you originally agreed on the schedule of payments that you agreed
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.560]   in the credit card agreement.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yes, it's wrong for you to break into somebody's apartment while they're away on vacation
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.280]   and eat their food and sleep in their bed and then to load all their furniture up in
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.120]   a truck when you leave and they're on their way home.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   But it's also wrong for you to live in your landlord's apartment while not making the
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.080]   agreed upon rent payments with them.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.840]   It's wrong for you to walk into your local pharmacy with a gun in your hand and clean
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.100]   the safe out of the pills in order for you to support your drug addiction.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.600]   But it's also wrong for you to go down to the local hospital for medical treatment where
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.560]   they patch you up and drug you up and send you out the door healthy and healed and then
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.660]   never go bother to go back and try to settle your bill and pay for the goods and services
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.880]   that made you well.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:23.360]   Now there are differences in intention, yes, but take responsibility for these things.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.760]   It's wrong to steal.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.440]   It's wrong to steal.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.320]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.680]   The book of Psalms in the Bible says the wicked borrows but does not pay back.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   If you're one who borrowing and not paying back, that is a wicked thing to do.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.120]   But the solution is to pay back the things that you owe.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.800]   And if you have that intention, if you have that clear intention, if you have that firm
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.120]   conviction, then we can go back and start to arrange these things so that you can start
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.520]   to pay back your creditors.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.200]   And that's what I want to help you do.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.080]   I want to help you protect you along the way.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.680]   I want to protect your family.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.800]   But we want to make these situations right.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   How do you make the situation right?
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   Well, the answer for theft, the right thing to do in case of theft is to make restitution
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.360]   and to pay back the things that you've stolen.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:28.000]   If my son goes into a local grocery store and steals something, let's just say he
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   steals a toy.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.800]   When I was a kid, I stole magazines from the grocery store.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.600]   I would go and I would read truck magazines and I would slide them in my pants and I would
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.400]   steal them and walk out.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.680]   And I think I was caught at some point.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.760]   I think the details are hazy at this point.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.680]   But I just – I know I did that when I was a kid.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.320]   So if my son does that, he follows in my footsteps and he goes into the grocery store and he's
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:58.560]   reading magazines and he steals a truck magazine from the grocery store, then what do I – as
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.360]   a good parent, what do I need to do for him?
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.360]   1.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:12.560]   I need to help him to face his action square on and to take responsibility for his sin.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:18.680]   There needs to be a reckoning and an exposure of that behavior.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:26.400]   So the way that you make a wrong situation right is you face it squarely and you confess
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   it.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.880]   So of course confession of course is first to God and then to others around you, to somebody
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.160]   that's involved, a trusted friend.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.880]   But sin needs to be acknowledged.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.260]   And then there's a confession back to the person that's been wronged in the situation.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:47.680]   So if my son were to follow in what I did and I believe this is what my parents did
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.120]   but I don't remember it at this point.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.000]   But I remember one time I stole money out of my mom's purse a lot and that was a very
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.360]   – that one I do remember the painful circumstances of getting that situation right.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.700]   But the first thing we do is we confront with the wrongness which is what I'm doing to
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.700]   you today.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.800]   If you're in a situation where you're not paying your debts, this is what I'm
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   doing.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.060]   I'm confronting you and I'm bringing your actions and saying you need to acknowledge
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.060]   what you've done.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:19.020]   So if my son stole magazines from the grocery store, then it's my responsibility to confront
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:25.520]   him with that and to get him to confess to his theft.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.600]   Then we would confess that sin on our knees together before the Lord, ask for forgiveness.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.840]   Then we would take that, it would be a confession in this case to a responsible party which
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.040]   would be us or his parents.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.460]   And then we would go back and I would take him to the grocery store and he would go and
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:46.360]   he would confess his sin to the managers or the people involved in that grocery store.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.880]   That would be the important action to go and make that confession to the person that's
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.840]   been wronged.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.420]   And then he needs to take responsibility for that crime.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.120]   Now in some circumstances, that's going to involve taking legal responsibility.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.240]   Of course, it's different if my son steals a $5 magazine.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.200]   You wouldn't necessarily expect him to send a six-year-old to jail.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.700]   But in some circumstances, that does involve getting involved with the legal system and
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.840]   taking legal responsibility.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.800]   But there's the taking of responsibility and then he would need to make restitution.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.060]   He would need to pay back the thing that was stolen and make the situation right.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.320]   Usually this would involve paying back what was stolen with extra, with some amount of
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.960]   extra.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.440]   And then however long that takes, however much he has to work, whatever has to be done,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.760]   there is – that's how he takes responsibility.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.040]   And so with you, let me challenge you.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.440]   If you're in a situation here where you're behind on your bills and you're not paying
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:56.080]   your creditors as agreed, I humbly ask you to consider why have you stolen from your
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   creditors?
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:07.560]   And then I humbly ask you to consider how you can make things right with them.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:13.520]   And the way to make things right is to acknowledge the wrong and to make confession for it and
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:20.000]   then to go back and to write the situation and make restitution for your error, for your
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   sin, for your behavior.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.720]   Now there are a few errors that we commit when assessing the subject.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.840]   The first thing is we always look and try to justify motive first and foremost.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.320]   And I think this is probably the biggest thing when it comes to debt.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.240]   You say, "Well, it's simple if my son steals a magazine because that's just pleasure.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   It's not a matter of life or death.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.680]   But what about if he steals a loaf of bread to feed his dying sibling?"
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.120]   Well, yes, motive matters to an extent but we still got to deal with the rightness and
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.440]   wrongness of the situation.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.520]   So don't start with justifying yourself.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:00.000]   Rather, take responsibility and take responsibility and take it quickly.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.520]   I think this for most of us is our biggest challenge.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.560]   This is my personal Achilles heel.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.680]   My instinct is usually to run from problems but that makes them worse.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.000]   It always does.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.240]   And I often don't want to take responsibility but that always makes it worse.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.280]   And so I seek to continue to encourage myself and I encourage you.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.240]   Take responsibility as quickly as you can in these circumstances.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.180]   And if you haven't taken responsibility thus far, I'm going to share with you some things
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.720]   here to do so.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.200]   So what do we start with?
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.960]   Well, let's start by figuring out where you are.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.760]   Let me give you an action plan.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.680]   You got to start by figuring out where you are.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.960]   We want to face the circumstances clearly.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:45.040]   So that begins with making a listing of your debts.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.720]   As far as the tools that you need, let's start with a notebook.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.560]   The fundamental tool that you need to work your way out of this mess is a notebook.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   You need a physical paper notebook and I recommend that you use an attached pen to that notebook.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.800]   What I do when I'm using a notebook like this is I get a pen, I take a string, a piece of
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.240]   duct tape, I wrap duct tape with a string at one end of the pen and I duct tape the
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.200]   other end of the string to the back of the notebook.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   That way I always have a pen.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.840]   I got a pen and a notebook to organize my information.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.000]   This organization, if you pursue it, will start to build a habit in you that will help
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.080]   you throughout all of your financial life.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:30.160]   Most people who get deeply into financial problems usually get there from a lack of
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.200]   organization and a lack of forethought.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.580]   There are many circumstances with regard to financial distress and somebody who's behind
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580]   on their bills.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.080]   We need to look at the actual circumstances.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.960]   Unfortunately, I can't do that but I want to acknowledge there's a big difference between
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.000]   you owe nobody any money and all of a sudden you wind up with a million-dollar bill at
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.400]   the local hospital for cancer treatment.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.760]   There's a big difference between that versus somebody who has 40 credit cards that are
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.860]   all behind and are five years behind.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.760]   But much of the time, it comes down to lack of disorganization.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.540]   I'm tending here towards the things that are – I'm tending in this analysis towards
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.560]   somebody who's in a circumstance where they have a lot of credit cards, car payments,
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.800]   student loans, behind on bills just through disorganization.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.880]   Usually this happens because you get overwhelmed with life.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.760]   You get overwhelmed with not knowing how to run your money.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.560]   It's hard to get connected to it.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.720]   Don't pay much attention to what's in the checking account.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.040]   Don't have a monthly budget.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.920]   Don't know how much money is coming in and how much money is going out.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.360]   Well, if that's what caused the financial distress in the first place, you got to solve
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.960]   that problem.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.320]   And so you're going to have to develop new skills.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.080]   One of those skills is organization.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.040]   So you begin with a notebook with an attached pen so you have a place to record all your
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.320]   information in one place.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.560]   And in a moment, we'll talk about communication.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:04.280]   You start by making a list of everything that you owe to anybody that you owe.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.640]   So ways to do this, start with pulling a copy of your credit report.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.440]   Go to annualcreditreport.com.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.560]   Again annualcreditreport.com, that's the official website that you can use to download
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.280]   a current copy of your credit report.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.720]   You can do that for free once every 12 months.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   Start with that.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   Download your credit report.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.200]   Do the same for your spouse or have them do it.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.480]   And then make a listing of everything that's listed there, all of the debts that are listed
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.280]   on your credit report.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   For most people, this will be a pretty good list.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.320]   You may have some debts that are outside of it.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.680]   But for most of us who are involved in the modern financial system, this will be a pretty
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   good starting point.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:46.560]   It will be a long list of credit cards, of student loans, et cetera, mortgages, car payments,
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   et cetera.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.160]   Now you may have things that are outside of it.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.120]   Maybe you have a private loan with a friend or family member.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.920]   Maybe you had a business loan that wasn't reflected on your credit report.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.480]   Also add those things down.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.280]   And rank a complete list of those on a piece of paper.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.360]   Find out who you owe, collect all the bills and find out how much you owe.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.520]   And then search your memory to make sure that everything is reflected on that paper.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.960]   Don't forget any of it.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.280]   Then face that list square on.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.120]   Of course, here's where we have to deal with things as they are.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.480]   Start with facing the list and taking responsibility for your actions.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.240]   If there's a place of confession for your actions, do that.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.600]   If there's a place of reaching out and acknowledging to somebody that you've borrowed money from,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   do that.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.480]   This is much easier done, of course, when there's a person.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.480]   For example, if you have a landlord, it might be a good idea to call – you're two months
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:51.720]   behind on your rent or you walked out on a previous agreement and you owed your landlord
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.220]   back rent.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.240]   That would be the type of person that you can personally contact.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.600]   And if you take responsibility with these types of things, you'll find I think your
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.240]   whole situation changes.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   Taking responsibility for your actions is the opposite of what most people do.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.480]   Contact any landlord, someone who owns a handful of rental houses or apartments and start asking
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.320]   about the stories people give them when they don't want to pay their rent.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.200]   If you'll just take responsibility, you'll magically find yourself in a new relationship
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.640]   with them.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.960]   So I would try something like this.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.640]   If I had a landlord, I would call them and I would say, "Dear landlord, I know you're
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.120]   surprised to hear from me.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.160]   I haven't been very communicative recently and I'm sorry.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.440]   I was really overwhelmed by my circumstances.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   I lost my job.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.780]   My wife was sick.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.960]   We just didn't know what to do and I've fallen behind on my rent.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   And I'm sorry.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.360]   But I'm ready to try again and I want you to know that I take full responsibility for
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.720]   the money that I owe you.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.640]   I don't know yet how I'm going to pay you back, but I'm working on it.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.480]   And I want to let you know that I won't be avoiding your phone calls anymore.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.160]   I won't be avoiding you, but I'll be available and communicating with you frequently as we
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   figure out a plan.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   And I'm sorry.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.480]   I'm going to make things right."
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.320]   That's a very freeing conversation.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.400]   And your relationship with the landlord will change night and day because they don't hear
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.480]   that.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.880]   So if they're personal creditors, that would be a good place to start.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:17.400]   Little harder to do that with a big faceless entity of a bill collection agency with a
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.600]   debt that's been sold five times over and you're dealing with a debt collector that
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.360]   bought the debt, again, five times – five layers deep.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   But still, do what you can to take responsibility with those.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.720]   So make a list of what you owe.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:39.480]   Now additionally in this notebook, you need to log your communication with your creditors.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   What I would do is I would devote a page in the notebook, a separate page or a section
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.980]   depending on how many creditors, the type of creditor and the layout of your notebook.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.480]   But I would devote a page of that notebook to each of my creditors and I would start
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:59.740]   a log, a record of each and every one of my communications with them, each and every one
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.640]   of my phone calls with them.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   I would record all letters, all interaction, emails, texts, anything.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:12.240]   I would start to record those things very, very carefully to make sure that I'm not
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.920]   forgetting anybody and also to make sure that I'm communicating with them.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.320]   One of the principles that you want to apply in this process of getting out of debt is
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.640]   good consistent communication.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.040]   Again, most people run from their debts.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.480]   Most people run from their responsibilities and this is very frustrating when you're
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.840]   owed money.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.880]   If you've ever been in a situation where you've lent somebody money, you know how
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.400]   frustrating this is.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.920]   Oftentimes as a lender, you know you're taking a risk.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:47.240]   You know that the person might face hard times and they may not be able to pay you in a certain
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   way.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   You know they're facing hard times.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.000]   But all you want is a conversation and an honest discussion so you can make a plan.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.200]   Frequently as a lender, you may be willing to work with somebody.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.960]   You may be willing to – landlords are often willing to lower the rent for a period of
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.080]   time or to help in some way if they can.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.600]   But they can't do those things if there's no communication.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:14.280]   So you want to firmly place yourself in the world of communicating frequently with my
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   creditors.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.720]   Now even if you're dealing with people like credit card collectors, debt collectors, if
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:25.480]   you'll simply communicate, communicate honestly and forthrightly with people, you'll find
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.680]   that you can stay out of the legal system.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.360]   And in debt collection, you want to stay out of the legal system.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:40.800]   It's very painful when you wind up in court losing your lawsuit, which you will because
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.320]   you owe the money.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.360]   And now all of a sudden, your creditor has a judgment taken out against you and they're
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.160]   able to come and to wipe out your bank account.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.600]   It's a problem.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.560]   So you want to stay out of that situation.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.240]   But the way you stay out of that situation is by taking responsibility, communicating
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.400]   frequently with your creditors and then working on making plans that will make things right.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.680]   Your creditors don't actually want to sue you because it costs them a lot of money and
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.920]   they're going to wind up with less money and they know you probably don't have a
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.440]   lot of money anyway.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.420]   So they don't want to sue you.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.640]   But if you don't communicate, you're going to force them to sue you quicker than they
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.040]   might otherwise do it.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.960]   So you want to log your communication with your creditors in your notebook and you want
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.040]   to make sure that you're frequently speaking with your creditors.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.240]   The next tool you need to be prepared for this process of getting out of debt, paying
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.880]   all your creditors back is a filing system.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   You need a simple filing system.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.160]   And this is often hard for people who are in debt.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.440]   Again, you're going to have to learn new skills.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.480]   If you were organized with your money, you probably wouldn't be in this situation.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.720]   But you're in the situation because you're not organized with your money.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.240]   So let me explain it just a very simple filing system what I would implement if I woke up
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.920]   deeply in debt, owing a lot of money.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.040]   I would go to the local office supply store or Walmart or wherever and I would buy what's
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.920]   called an expanding file pocket.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.240]   There's one of these cardboard, I would say other than pockets, but they have a number
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:21.640]   of pockets in them and they kind of expand and contract depending on how much paper is
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   in them.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.840]   And I would buy one that has enough room for the number of creditors that I have.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.600]   If I owe five credit cards, then I would buy one like that.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.880]   If I owe 30, I might have to get one that has more pockets or maybe a couple of them.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.860]   And then I would label those and devote one file pocket to each creditor.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.720]   So I have a very simple place to keep all of my papers that I'm going to have.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.240]   And I'm going to be a lot of papers.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.040]   When you're dealing with debt collectors, one of the things that's very important that
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:35:00.280]   you do now and that you continue to do forever is to communicate with them on paper.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.840]   Paper is proof of what you're doing.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.000]   So you want to consistently communicate on paper.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.560]   You never take phone conversations as gold.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.500]   You only deal with things in written paper and you save all of those so that you're prepared
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:22.420]   to show what you're doing with regard to your personal circumstances and correspondence.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.620]   As you put these papers in place, you're going to organize them by date.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.000]   So again, they're organized by creditor in each pocket and then just simply keep things
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.240]   in order of date.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.500]   Put the oldest communication on the bottom of the stack and the newest communication
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.940]   on the top and organize things by date.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.760]   What I frequently do when I'm organizing lots of legal papers is I'll just highlight the
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.520]   date on the paper.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.720]   Frequently with legal documents, things like that, it's hard to find the date in all of
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   the clutter.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.620]   So when I receive a piece of communication or I'm organizing things, just take a little
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.180]   highlighter and highlight the date.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.880]   That allows me to quickly and easily collate them and stack them by date.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.020]   And all of your correspondence is going to be filed and kept in this one place.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:04.440]   So you're building a record, a file of your communication with this particular creditor.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.840]   Now final tool, this is not mandatory, but for many people this would be helpful, is
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.780]   in the coming months, you're going to have a lot of communication.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:18.080]   And so you need to have a printer, if at all possible, and a copy machine, if at all possible
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.300]   as well.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.620]   If you are very poor and you have a transient living situation, this may be out of your
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.680]   reach.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:33.480]   But today you can buy, $50 or $60 can get you a small, cheap copier, scanner, and printer
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   online on Amazon.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   I checked it out.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.720]   $50, $60 can get you a small, cheap copier, scanner, printer.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.360]   You just need black and white.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.520]   But you're going to be doing a lot of copies.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.100]   You need copies of everything.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.160]   Copies of canceled checks, copies of payment, copies of letters that you're sending.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   And you're going to be doing some printing as well.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.520]   You can write these things physically if you don't have a printer.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   So if you don't have a printer, that's fine.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.160]   If you don't have a computer, you can write letters by hand, but still you need copies
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   of them.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.440]   And so it would be worth considering getting a copy machine.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.060]   If not, you may be able to use one at work or you may be able to rent one at the local
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:08.420]   library or at an office supply store like a FedEx Kinko or something like that.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:13.260]   But a copy machine would be a helpful piece of tool for you to have if you don't have
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.260]   one.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.960]   Now in a moment, we'll continue with the tools and I'll give you some strategies.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.800]   But first, let me share with you about HelloFresh.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.720]   HelloFresh, I've been doing these ads for what, four or five months now?
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   HelloFresh is awesome.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.560]   They're a meal delivery service where they will send you, you sign up and they send you,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.280]   you choose what kind of recipes you want.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   You choose what type of food you like and how big your family is.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.320]   And then they send you a box and you choose what day works best for you to receive the
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.000]   box.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.440]   And they send you a box of groceries.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.720]   All of the groceries come with ingredients.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.040]   They're pre-measured and coordinated, organized meal kits.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.400]   So you know which ingredients go with which recipe.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.280]   It's delivered right to your door.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.240]   It's insulated for the things that are cold.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   They're insulated.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.560]   You take them out, run them right in the fridge and you're ready to go.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.080]   When they send you the box and then it comes to dinner time, all you do is you look through
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.440]   the recipe cards and say, "Well, which of these recipes do I want to make?"
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.720]   You grab that recipe, you grab that box out of the fridge and in, for me, 20, 30 minutes,
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.840]   20 meals, 20 minutes or so, you're in there and you've got that thing put together and
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.740]   you've got fresh, delicious food.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:24.680]   At this time of year where it just seems so busy with the holidays and all of us, I think,
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:29.480]   have more demands put on us during the holiday season, that convenience is really, really
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.600]   valuable.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.660]   Where somebody else is doing all the shopping and the recipe planning and they're delivering
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.000]   it right to you and all you do is just put it together and make it.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.140]   HelloFresh is really great, great food.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.720]   It's not as cheap as doing everything yourself.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.280]   Of course not.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.060]   You could do the planning.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.520]   You could do all the shopping as well.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.400]   But it's cheaper than going out to eat by a good margin and it's fun.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.840]   It's fun and it's better quality food.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.720]   If you've never tried HelloFresh, give it a shot.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.920]   Go to HelloFresh.com, sign up, use coupon code RPF30.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.780]   HelloFresh.com, use coupon code RPF30.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:10.300]   That coupon code saves you 30 bucks off your first week of deliveries and use it as a way
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.000]   even to learn to cook.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.920]   When all the recipes are there, most of them they have careful instructions and they have
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.040]   detailed listings of how to do it.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.280]   You can use it as a pretty great way to learn how to cook food from scratch as well.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.680]   So visit HelloFresh.com, use a coupon code RPF30.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.320]   Now back to the tools.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.040]   Next three tools we're going to talk about, phone, email and mail.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.020]   I'm going to give you a couple of ideas that I've never really heard anyone else talk about
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.560]   but I think will be helpful to you.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.600]   If at all possible, what I would recommend is that you separate your phone system so
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:55.920]   that you have a separate phone number on which to take all of your creditor discussions.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   Most people just have one phone number, a cell phone number that they use, but this
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.780]   is really stressful.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.640]   One of the things that people face when they're behind on their bills is constant calls from
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.120]   debt collectors and they want to reach you at all times.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.400]   Most people just get to the point where they run from the phone and they only pick up – they
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.000]   use the phone completely to screen with caller ID and they only pick up the phone when it's
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.680]   a known contact, which okay, that's fine.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.560]   But I think there are better ways.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.220]   What I want to do is I want to make sure that in my communication strategy, I'm setting
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:31.260]   aside time consistently, probably weekly, biweekly to communicate with my creditors
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.040]   but I'm not going to let them run my life.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.240]   After all, the way that I'm going to get out of debt is to increase my income, which
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.760]   means do a good job at work.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.440]   If I have a job, build a good business.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.200]   If I need to build a business, I need to control my expenses.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.520]   I've got things to do other than talking to bill collectors all the time and I don't
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.960]   need that stress.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.800]   So I would want to separate my phone number and just have all creditors in one place.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:59.120]   I think probably the simplest way and the best way to do this technologically for most
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.880]   people would be for you to move your phone number that you use.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.000]   Move your existing phone number to Google Voice and then go ahead and get yourself a
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.840]   new phone number for your personal contacts and your personal discussions.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.120]   Google Voice, I of course hate to recommend any Google product but in this case, you're
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.040]   broke so we'll take advantage of what they've got and when you're rich, we'll work on
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.240]   better solutions that are going to be a little bit better than doing business with Google.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.280]   But you can port your number from your phone to Google Voice.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.760]   Google Voice charges you 20 bucks one time for you to do that, to establish a phone number
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.840]   with them.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.440]   And then from then on, there's no additional charge for that.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.000]   Now what do you get with Google Voice?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.680]   Google Voice is basically a phone and text management system but it allows you to place
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.240]   calls from your number, from your Google Voice number and it allows you to receive and to
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.040]   organize all of your voicemails, your text messages as well.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   And you can forward your number from Google Voice to other phones for you to pick up in
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.320]   time.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.840]   So as an example, if I moved my phone number to Google Voice, now all my creditors are
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.520]   going to have that number.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.080]   And I would then get a new number and forward that number from Google Voice to my other
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.760]   number so they're going to answer.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.520]   Google Voice allows you to do things like forward calls during a certain time.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:26.000]   So as an example, your creditors, you're allowed to under the Fair Debt Collections
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.640]   Practices Act, you're allowed to instruct your creditors about when they can call you
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   and when they can't call you.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   You can forbid your creditors from calling you at work.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.400]   But what I would do is I would set it up and I would say to them, "Listen, I'll speak
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.200]   to you on these days between these hours from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock at night, Monday through
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   Friday.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.680]   But the rest of the time, I can set that Google Voice number up so the calls don't even go
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.960]   through.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.200]   So they don't even get passed through to my telephone."
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.260]   And that's really, really helpful.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.760]   Other things that are helpful about Google Voice is you'll have an easy record of all
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   of your voicemails.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.280]   And that record is on the computer where you can save those voicemails.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.080]   You are not allowed to be abused by a debt collector.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.280]   And so in order for you to keep yourself from being abused, it's valuable for you to collect
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.820]   the information and to keep your debt collectors on edge so they know they're on the record.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.860]   So voicemails that are being recorded is helpful.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.760]   So they can't, for example, a debt collector is not allowed to swear at you.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.440]   They're not allowed to leave you angry voicemails swearing at you in a voicemail.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.880]   So having those in Google Voice is very, very helpful to you.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.960]   Additionally, by using Google Voice, you'll have a record of all of the calls, all of
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.460]   the any text messages because you can use Google to communicate with that as well.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.440]   And it's all in one place.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.880]   Additional benefits to Google Voice, you can use Google Voice to record phone calls easily.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.080]   For an incoming call, you can use Google Voice just by you press 4 on your keypad and it'll
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.240]   automatically start call recording.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.160]   And I would when negotiating with creditors, I would record every single call.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.440]   So check out Google Voice and see if that might be a good solution for you.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.700]   And go ahead and get a new phone number and make sure that you don't ever give that phone
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.240]   number out to anybody except personal friends.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.400]   So that way you're only communicating with people.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.680]   You don't have to be scared of your phone.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.840]   When you're in war mode to deal with your bill collectors, then you get yourself in
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:21.720]   that mode and you go into that war room, that Google Voice identity or whatever it is, and
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.760]   you deal with it there.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.560]   And if you're not in war mode, you don't need to worry about them invading your life.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.080]   That's one simple thing that I would do.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.660]   Now, if you don't want to go the Google Voice route, I would consider going ahead and getting
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.360]   a new phone and then either just taking my number if the current number is what all the
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   bill collectors have.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.640]   I would port that to just a separate burner phone, just to get a get a self a move it
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.360]   to a simple, cheap prepaid number somehow.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.760]   But I would keep a separate cell phone.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.200]   If I didn't want to do Google Voice route, I'd keep a separate cell phone.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.800]   So that way that phone can be off all of the time unless I'm in work mode.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.760]   I'm in war mode, in which case I turn the phone on, I listen to the voice messages and
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.680]   I start making calls to my creditors and I tell them, "Here's what I'm doing.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680]   Here's what I can send you.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.060]   Here's when I can send it to you."
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.280]   And then I power that thing off and it's not allowed to interrupt my life.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:17.040]   I'm not going to have my date night with my wife ruined by a bill collector calling.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.840]   Other options as well you can use, of course, if you have an iPhone, there's a really useful
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.480]   calling app called Sudo, S-U-D-O.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   Very useful.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.880]   Allows you to keep 10 different phone numbers and integrated identities with telephone,
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.380]   texting and email all on your iPhone in a separate app.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.960]   Also with Android, probably the best app I've found on Android devices would be the Burner
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.160]   app but it's a little easier on iPhone.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.320]   Someday Sudo is going to come to Android so maybe that'll happen soon as well.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.920]   But you want to have these phone calls logged in one specific place.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.120]   You want to have a record of them as well.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.040]   And then again, finally, with calls, you want to record your calls.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.900]   So again, I talked about Google Voice.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:57.320]   If you're using a smartphone to record your calls, you can use an app like Tape-a-Call.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   Tape-a-Call Pro.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.160]   It costs you $10 a year and allows you to record all of your phone calls.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.820]   I would do that.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:09.360]   Or another easy option is to use a simple and cheap voice recorder and then to take
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.560]   all of your calls on a speakerphone so that way you can record both sides.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.120]   Easiest way, you probably have an old cell phone, an old smartphone sitting around that's
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.160]   old, maybe an old iPhone 4 or things like that that you can't sell.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.640]   It's not worth anything.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.120]   But it'll work great as a voice recorder.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.880]   And so you just use the voice memo and record that thing and put it on speakerphone and
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   do that.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880]   That works really well.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.200]   That's a great voice recorder.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.520]   Anytime you're in a potentially contentious situation, I think it's a good idea to protect
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.820]   yourself by recording things.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.960]   Sometimes video, you can do that.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.600]   But oftentimes, at least audio is very, very helpful.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.000]   I've done this in the past when I've been in contentious situations with somebody that
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.080]   I made sure I made – I need a record.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.800]   I need a record of it.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.720]   There are various state laws on recording circumstances.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.520]   In general, it has to do with where you are in public.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.880]   Everybody has no expectation of privacy in a public place.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:11.400]   On the phone, some states require just simply one person to know that they are being recorded.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.320]   In some states, they're supposed to – both parties are supposed to know that they're
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.680]   being recorded.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.560]   What I would do is I would go ahead and play it safe and make sure that both parties know
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.560]   that they're being recorded.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.120]   This will also help to make sure the other person, the bill collector, is going to follow
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.120]   the rules.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.040]   Again, remember, in these circumstances, so I started, take responsibility.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.640]   I'm going to stand good for my debt.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.960]   I'm not going to be abused.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.680]   So I want to help you.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.240]   You're going to stand good for your debt.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.000]   I don't want you to be abused.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.240]   So one thing you do is at the beginning of every call, "Hey, just a moment before we
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.960]   get started, I just want to let you know that I'm recording the call for quality and – what
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.080]   do they call it?
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.600]   For quality assurance purposes, right?
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   Just going to make sure I want to let you know that up front."
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   Now let's get to it.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.920]   Here's what's going on.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.520]   Make those records and keep them carefully.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.240]   That's just a phone system.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:11.520]   Quickly on email, email is not used heavily with regard to bill collection.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.480]   Necessarily it's not – it's sometimes used but it's not used heavily.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.460]   But what I would also do is I would establish new email addresses.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:24.320]   If my personal email address, my standard email address is filled with my bill collectors,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   I want out.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.800]   I'm going to cancel that address and I'm not going to use it.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.320]   I'm going to set up a new one for my actual personal communication.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.520]   It is really frustrating when you're having a good day at work, you're working hard
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.440]   and all of a sudden at lunchtime, you pull out your phone and you're looking at your
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.080]   email and there's 10 emails from a bunch of bill collectors and it comes and ruins
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.440]   your mood and reminds you how much stress you're under.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.920]   Or you're out on date night with your wife and go to the bathroom and you look at your
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.240]   email and all of a sudden you're reminded about the fact that you're fighting your
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.720]   way out of debt and it wrecks your evening.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:58.480]   So I would have email segregated away from my normal interaction.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:03.080]   So a couple of ways to do that, number one is of course if they already have one address,
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.320]   you may consider just starting a new address for your personal work.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.680]   But I would also just consider establishing a new address for the purpose of working my
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.280]   way out of debt.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.000]   So establish a new email address because – especially because we're dealing with sensitive personal
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   information.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.200]   I would use proton mail so that my emails are stored in an encrypted format.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.440]   It would be superior to Gmail.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.720]   So at least we get – it's free.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.560]   You can set up an account, use proton mail so that your emails are being stored encrypted
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.620]   and then use that for communication with your creditors if you need to.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:37.400]   But keep that separate and only limited communication via email.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:43.320]   Mailing address, one thing I don't know why more people don't do is think about
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.880]   setting up a separate mailing address to use to communicate with your creditors.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:52.000]   If I were in this situation, I would go ahead and pay a little bit of extra money to establish
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.120]   a post office box and use that for communication with my creditors.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.120]   Here's why.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:59.680]   PO boxes are cheap to use and for most of us, they're pretty convenient.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.800]   There are many post offices near us.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.560]   PO boxes are – they range depending on where you live.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.040]   But we're talking $100 to $200 a year.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.960]   They're pretty cheap.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:16.520]   They allow you to communicate reliably via the mail without having your actual physical
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.640]   location necessarily be known.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.520]   This is really important.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.280]   One of the things that people who are the most abused often face is they miss mail.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.840]   Of course, people ignore their mail.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.600]   But when you get to people who are really struggling, what one author affectionately
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:38.880]   calls clueless people, when clueless people move a lot, they lose mail and they lose important
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.040]   communication and you cannot miss your mail.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.960]   If you miss important communication in a debt collection scenario, you could actually wind
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.480]   up in jail in an extreme circumstance.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.120]   Now, most of the time, of course, you're not.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.400]   But you need that communication so that you can receive the letters, you can receive the
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.760]   offers, you can communicate properly with your debtors.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.480]   But how you would end up in jail, as you work your way through, let's say that you didn't
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.840]   pay your debts and you ignored all of your summons, you ignored the credit card, you
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.040]   just moved and they didn't have any way to get a hold of you.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.080]   One of the things that can actually happen, and some debt collectors will use this, if
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.400]   they don't hear from you, they will sue you in court.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   Now, you don't actually have to show up in court.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   They will sue you.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.640]   If you don't show up to defend yourself, they'll win the lawsuit and they'll take out a judgment
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.240]   against you, which means you owe them $10,000.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.680]   The court authorizes them to collect the $10,000 that you owe.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.960]   That's a legal judgment that they have attained against you.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:39.980]   And once they've obtained that judgment in court, they can now use that and a judgment
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:45.760]   creditor can get the court to go ahead and issue a wage garnishment order or they can
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.120]   get the court to issue an order to attach your bank account.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.320]   But what do they do if they can't find you?
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.400]   Well, if an aggressive creditor can't find your income or they can't find your assets
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:00.720]   for them to take to pay your bills, they can file papers with the court that require you
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.320]   to appear for a debtors examination.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.400]   And then the way it works, if you show up at the debtors examination, then they have
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:12.520]   the right to ask you and you have to answer under oath their questions about your finances.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.560]   You have to explain why you're not paying your bills.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.760]   You have to explain to them how much money that you have and where it is and what assets
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   you have.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.080]   And this is a real problem because you're under oath.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:26.600]   So if you lie, you will now be found guilty of perjury, which is a real legal problem.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.560]   Now if you don't show up for that debtors examination, even if it's just because you
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.200]   didn't receive the notice or maybe you decided you didn't want to go, then the court can
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.960]   find you in civil contempt for disobeying its order to appear.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.620]   And so now you're found in contempt of court where if they know where you are, that could
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:48.360]   eventually wind up putting you in jail because you're found in contempt of court.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.560]   Or it makes it very inconvenient when you get pulled over for a simple infraction.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.640]   All of a sudden, now your car is left on the side of the road and you're going away in
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.700]   the back of the police car because you didn't get your mail.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:03.280]   So you didn't know that a judgment was taken out against you and you had a debtors examination
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   ordered and you didn't show up in court.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:11.880]   And depending on who you owe money to and depending on how nasty they are, they can
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.160]   use this as a tool to try to collect debts from you, especially somebody you owe money
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:20.080]   to that's an unsecured debt that doesn't really have any other authority and leverage over
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   you.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.120]   They'll use these debtors exams as a way to try to get you in there and try to get you
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.620]   to slip up and not appear.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.880]   So you need to receive mail.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.780]   Your problem is not going to get better because you ignore it.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:35.180]   If you have creditors and they don't know where you are, you need to give them a mailing
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:38.220]   address where they can communicate with you.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.460]   Ignoring these things causes problems.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.280]   So you do it with a post office box.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:48.220]   What I would do is if I were receiving mail at my house, even if I'm not planning on moving,
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.660]   I would put a move order in with the local post office and I would forward all of my
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.580]   mail from my house to the post office.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:58.180]   And that gives you the ability to even just to protect your family.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:04.020]   It's really obnoxious to go to the mailbox and go out there and you're looking for a
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:08.140]   card from grandma and you're looking for a catalog from something that you like and a
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:14.060]   magazine subscription that you enjoy and have to face every single time five – you know,
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:20.460]   five deficiency – five letters from lawyers because you're not paying your bills.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.420]   If it were me, I wouldn't want to do that to my family.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.900]   I wouldn't want to do that to my wife.
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:27.500]   I would make sure that I would use a post office box and I would go when I'm in a good
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.500]   frame of mind, I'm going to go in, I'm going to sort the mail.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:34.060]   I'm just not going to show up at the house and mess with my family.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:38.860]   This would also give you more flexibility in terms of moving without also exposing all
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.060]   of your mail.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   Once you have your mail forwarded to a post office box, it gives you the ability to move
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.540]   and still receive your mail.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.020]   But it allows you to change your living circumstances.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:52.420]   As you work your way out of debt, you may need to move in with friends or family for
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.380]   a temporary amount of time in order to eliminate your rent payment.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.660]   You may need to rent a cheap apartment in order to cut your expenses.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:04.220]   So while you're making these things – making these life changes in order to pay your bills,
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:08.420]   this will allow you to do that without being connected to your mail, without your creditors
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.780]   knowing where you physically are all the time.
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.260]   Finally, also, you're going to be sending and receiving a good amount of certified mail.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:17.220]   The post office will make this much more convenient for you.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.980]   When your creditors are serving you, they're going to be sending certified mail which has
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.220]   to be signed for.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:27.780]   Again, I would – if I were in a mess, I'd sure hate to – my wife is a mother.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.780]   I'd sure hate to have her at 2 o'clock in the afternoon have to go and get another
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:41.060]   certified mail from the mailman that – just about how deeply in debt we are.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.900]   I'd a whole lot rather deal with that.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.900]   I'll get off of work.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.260]   I'll swing by the post office and I'll sign for it there.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.500]   And then also you'll be sending it.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.740]   And then in a moment, we'll talk about financial interaction.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.740]   You're going to be sending a lot of things like money orders.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.340]   And the post office makes this a convenient place for you.
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.300]   Post office sells money orders very inexpensively.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.900]   They're good to use in these circumstances and so I would be at the post office quite
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.000]   a bit in this situation.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.740]   So once I've adjusted these things, I would update my creditors with my new information.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.660]   I would go through all of my credit cards, all of my bank relations, all of the people
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:17.940]   that I owe money to and I would change my phone number, my mailing address, my email
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.940]   address, my mailing address with them.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.860]   By the way, the post office now allows – they didn't up until a few years ago but the
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.280]   post office now allows what's called street addressing.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.380]   So it used to be that if you were going to use a P.O.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:30.380]   Box, you had to say P.O.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.980]   Box 1234.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:39.800]   But now just like UPS store and other places, now you can go ahead and say 123 Main Street
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.280]   is my address, 123 Main Street number 1234.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.940]   And that's really helpful as well because it allows you to use your P.O.
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:52.340]   Box with some of your financial relationships without having to necessarily – where they
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.580]   often wouldn't accept a P.O.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.140]   Box number.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.060]   And then I would refuse to take correspondence anywhere else from those creditors to make
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:02.040]   sure it's coming where I say it was going to go and work with it.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   Why is this important?
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.480]   Why all these little things?
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.380]   Because this is going to take a long-term process.
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:12.540]   For most of us who are getting these deep situations, there's going to be months and
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:19.820]   years, maybe even decades of work and possibly of harassment.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:24.540]   If you have many accounts and are very late, your accounts are going to be sold.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.460]   They're to a debt collection agency.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.460]   Then they can't collect.
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:28.700]   They're going to resell it.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.700]   They're going to resell it.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.500]   And that's why your records are so important because it will be very hard for you to know
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.780]   what's valid and what's not if you don't have good records.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:44.000]   For example, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a creditor has – a debt collector
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.420]   has the right to notify you of a debt.
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:55.200]   But if they – if you don't actually – if you think the debt is not actually true,
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.500]   maybe it's something you paid off and there was an administrative problem, the debt was
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.500]   sold.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.060]   They think it's valid but you've already paid it off.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.420]   Or maybe it's just a fraudulent – it doesn't happen much.
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.460]   Maybe somebody just thinks it's a fraudulent scenario and they're trying to collect something
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:07.520]   from you.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:13.780]   You have the right to challenge them and say to them that – wait a second.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:14.780]   I don't know any money.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.700]   Prove to me what I owe, why I owe it and give me proof.
[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:24.860]   The problem is that if you don't do that within 30 days of receiving the initial notice,
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:33.180]   then the debt collector can move on and assume that it is valid.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:38.780]   So if you don't contest a debt within that time period, right within five days after
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.220]   you – sorry, within – yeah, is it five or 30?
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:46.860]   If you don't receive it and you don't contest it and they don't prove it to you,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:51.180]   you may wind up being responsible for a debt that you don't actually owe and it would
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:55.940]   really be a shame to have to pay extra money back that you didn't borrow, that you don't
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.580]   morally owe but you legally owe.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.380]   Again, that's why I distinct it moral, legal and practical.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:06.540]   You're not morally responsible for a debt that you didn't incur but yet legally you
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:10.060]   wind yourself paying something double because of your bad bookkeeping.
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.740]   Don't let that happen to you.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:17.420]   Next, if you don't have them already – in fact, if you listen to this, you're going
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.140]   to – just make it simple.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.820]   You need new bank accounts.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:29.260]   When you are in a contentious situation and you're facing legal problems, finding new
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:35.140]   bank accounts, I think you need to work very hard to keep your footprint in the public
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.900]   banking system as minimal as possible.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.060]   There's some caveats to that.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.740]   It doesn't mean you want to take away all your money.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:46.620]   For example, you don't want to all of a sudden start cashing out your 401(k).
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:52.100]   You need to understand your 401(k) as an example is protected from the legal claims of your
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.140]   creditors but your bank account is not.
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:59.940]   And so if I were facing an extremely contentious situation like this, I would try to make my
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.780]   money as minimally visible as possible and I would try to minimize my footprint in the
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.220]   banking system.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.900]   I want to make sure that I have full control of my finances.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.240]   And so I would close my old bank account and I would do my very best to live on cash as
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.620]   much as is possible.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:24.100]   Now, this will help you – let's talk about cash in a moment.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.200]   But it will help you get out of debt.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.660]   But just an example of why this is so important.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.420]   If – legally, here's how things work.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:37.220]   If you have an account, you've had a longstanding account for the last decade with Bank A and
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.500]   you have creditor number one that you have – were in good standing with five years
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:47.220]   ago but you haven't paid them in a couple of years.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.940]   But you used to pay creditor number one by means of a check, whether that was out of
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:55.180]   your check or maybe you made an automatic payment from your bank account.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.100]   So you fall behind with creditor number one.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.880]   They sue you in time.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.420]   They sue you and they win the lawsuit because they will.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.780]   Creditor lawsuits, if you owe somebody money, you'll never win because guess what?
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.180]   You owe them money and they have the right to collect.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:12.380]   So they sue you in court and they gain a legal judgment against you.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.220]   That legal judgment entitles them to collect on your assets.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.100]   They go from being a creditor to being a judgment creditor, which gives them additional legal
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.100]   rights.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:28.140]   Well, in this circumstance, they have the legal authority to get your money.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.500]   All they need to do is look back in their records and they look and say, "Oh, look.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.780]   Joshua paid us with Bank A. Let's go ahead and just send our bank representative over
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:44.540]   to Bank A with our legal judgment and our right to attach and collect his assets."
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.860]   They just walk right over to Bank A, they enter the appropriate paperwork and they clear
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.900]   out your bank account.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.060]   Simple and easy.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:55.020]   And you made it simple and easy for them because you've used Bank A to pay creditor number
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.020]   one.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:00.620]   Now, if you didn't still have Bank A, they go over to Bank A and they say, "Well, we're
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:06.780]   here to collect the money from Joshua's accounts," and they say, "Well, Joshua doesn't have any
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   accounts here.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.140]   He closed them a few years ago and wiped them out."
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.260]   Now they have to go and they have to find Joshua's accounts, which means additional
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.260]   cost.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.120]   They have to hire a private investigator or they have to figure out some other way of
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   figuring out where does Joshua bank.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.660]   They probably just go on Facebook and see what Joshua's Facebook profile says and,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.660]   "Look, there's a picture of Joshua at the local bank."
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.300]   We'll talk about social media, I think, more in a minute.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:36.660]   But you've made it easy for them by having Bank Account A. So you need to shut down your
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:43.020]   bank accounts and live on cash as much as is possible and you want to then go ahead
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.740]   and make sure that you at least open a new bank account.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.500]   So that will give you some level of protection.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:55.580]   The next reason you need to do this is just for your own – well, one more legal thing
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.100]   – sorry, I got out of order.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.700]   Make sure that you don't open a bank account with a financial institution to whom you owe
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   money.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.020]   You better think about this and go through your creditors because a lot of the big banks
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.900]   that many people do business with are also big creditors.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:19.180]   In some circumstances, you may wind up facing a situation known as a bank setoff.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.900]   So if you, for example, just have a simple – you have a checking account at your local
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:28.780]   credit card – credit union and you have a line of credit at your local credit union
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.380]   and you start missing payments.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:36.660]   A bank setoff is where your financial institution, your bank, your credit union, whatever, takes
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:40.540]   the money from a deposit account that you have, a checking, savings, CD or money market
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:45.220]   account in order to cover a payment on a loan that you missed.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.500]   Now there are some restrictions.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.260]   They can't take certain kinds of money.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.500]   Some kinds of money are exempt such as social security benefits or disability benefits,
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.260]   things like that.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:01.020]   But – and they can't take them out to cover credit card payments unless you've
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.860]   previously authorized them to cover credit card payments.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.980]   But this could be very inconvenient for you.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:11.700]   So just a good simple rule of thumb is don't have a bank account with money in it at the
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.860]   same place that you owe money.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.700]   Otherwise you might wind up facing a bank setoff.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.740]   That's a problem.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:24.340]   So now there are other lenders as well and all of these kind of steps will depend on
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:28.460]   what kind of debt you're facing and how far down the road you are.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.860]   For example, owe money to the IRS.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:34.500]   That's bad news because they can get right into your bank account without a court order.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:40.100]   When you give them that information, either by writing a check to pay a tax payment or
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.840]   them sending you a refund, now they'll suddenly know right where to go to find your money
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.180]   without any problem.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:53.900]   Certain types of debts, if you're behind on child support, there are much lower legal
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.500]   liabilities for those debts to be collected than other things.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:05.700]   And so you've got to be proactive about this and protect yourself now because the only
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.940]   advance notice you're going to receive, you're going to receive court orders, et cetera,
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.180]   by one day you just go and try to use your debit card and find out that it doesn't work
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:17.780]   and all of a sudden you wind up and realize that your bank account has been wiped out.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:23.100]   So what I recommend for you is that you live, while you're in the situation, live on cash.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.580]   This is good for you and it's good for your budgeting ability.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.460]   It's also good – it's good for you.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.480]   Frequently it's been – I can't name many good things that have come with all of
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.580]   our money being digitized.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.900]   Now there are some of us who thrive in a digital environment.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.200]   We live on spreadsheets and for us, the digital economy has been great, buying and selling
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.620]   everything digitally, doing everything on cards and automatic payments, et cetera.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.140]   But for people who don't live in front of a computer and for people who aren't all
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:06:00.620]   that numbers savvy, my observation that the digital economy has not been kind because
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:09.580]   it doesn't impose the same restrictions that other things – that cash has imposed
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.060]   in the past.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.500]   Many people, the way that they figure out how much money they have to spend is they
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.980]   look at their bank account and try to think if there's any money in it.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.580]   If there is, they swipe the debit card or they look at the credit card and see what's
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.540]   the balance available and if there's a balance available, they swipe their money.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.140]   This is not good.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:31.740]   So for most of us, living and working on cash will be very, very helpful.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.740]   And so it's good for you and good for your budgeting ability.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.400]   It's good for you in terms of saving you money.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.260]   One of the things that I have observed with people who are strapped and who owe lots of
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:45.620]   money is frequently they will authorize all kinds of automatic payments.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:49.460]   When you authorize these payments, they come in at the most inconvenient time.
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.380]   You need to make a $1,000 mortgage payment.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.660]   You have $1,100 in the account.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.540]   So you go ahead and you write that $1,000 mortgage payment.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:01.420]   Then all of a sudden you forgot that you had a power bill due and that was automatically
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.220]   taken out of your account.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:10.580]   And then you had authorized that $40 a month payment to the local furniture store and that
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:14.220]   $40 a month payment to the local furniture store put you in a position and it wiped out
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:19.060]   your account – sorry, wiped some money out of your account.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.940]   And now instead of having $1,000 to cover the check to the mortgage company, you only
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.700]   have $970.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.260]   And so your check to the mortgage company bounces.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.300]   Well now your check to the mortgage company bounces and the mortgage companies don't
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.820]   accept partial payments.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.860]   And you don't ever get that $1,000 together again and it gets wiped out.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.860]   Well guess what?
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:48.980]   If I can't pay all my bills, I'm never going to pay a furniture payment before I'm
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.420]   going to pay a mortgage payment.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.700]   That would be dumb.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:00.980]   Even if I had signed a collateralized obligation wherein I was saying that the furniture I'm
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:05.740]   buying from the furniture store on credit is going to be secured by the furniture, even
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:08.340]   if that – and that's not necessarily common.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.980]   Most of the time those loans are just an unsecured loan.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.760]   Even if I were in that situation, the furniture is in my house and the furniture company has
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.860]   no ability and authority to come and invade my house to take the furniture back.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:25.220]   But if I don't pay my mortgage, the whole house will be gone and the mortgage company
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:29.340]   does have the right to sell my house at foreclosure and to foreclose on me.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:32.220]   So it's way more important for me to pay that mortgage payment.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.200]   And I've seen this again and again and again with people who are struggling where you wind
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.860]   up with a stupid automatic payment messing everything up.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.740]   Don't do it.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.720]   Live on cash while you're in the situation.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.040]   Keep minimal money in the checking account.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.420]   If you need to use a checking account, which by the way you don't, you can today.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.420]   I'm convinced.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.420]   I thought about doing this.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:58.340]   I'm going to live without a checking account just to prove it can still be done.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.220]   There are a whole lot of people in the United States of America and around the world who
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.500]   live exclusively on cash.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:09.940]   Yes, you buy money orders for things you need physical payment for, but you can pay your
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:11.860]   power bill at an in-person location.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:18.740]   You can pay all these things in person and you can live still without a bank account.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.220]   But if you do need to use a bank account, at least do – keep one account for your
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:27.140]   mortgage and you only put money in there that's going to be sent to the mortgage payment and
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:31.100]   you write one check out of that and that's it, nothing else.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.300]   So living on cash is good for you.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:38.620]   It protects you and we want to – it's good for you in case you lose in court.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.500]   You may wind up in court when your creditors win.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.420]   It's good for you to have the money out and it's also good for you in terms of your
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.820]   privacy from your potential collectors.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:52.900]   You want to keep your income as private as possible, especially if you're in a contentious
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.340]   situation.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.260]   You should immediately cancel any direct deposit that you have that you're earning from a
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.900]   paycheck.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:06.020]   Immediately cancel any direct deposit because you cannot afford to have a creditor decide
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.980]   what happens with your money because they have a judgment and they take money out of
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.980]   your account.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.100]   In fact, I wouldn't even want – if at all possible, I don't want my creditors
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.380]   to know where I work.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.900]   So if you have had the same job for 10 years, well, they're going to know that.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:25.280]   But if you're in a job that has changed since you stopped paying the money, make sure
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.620]   that you're minimizing the records of where you work.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.340]   So don't deposit your paychecks in the bank account.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.340]   Cash them.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.900]   You can – the way that you deal in this world, you can go and cash your checks for
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:39.100]   free or very cheaply at the bank on which they're drawn.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.500]   If you're paid from a local bank, take your check in there and just cash it right at the
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.500]   bank.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   Many banks, it's cheap.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.500]   It's free.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.500]   Some banks, it's just cheap.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.500]   They charge you a few dollars.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   Or cash them somewhere else.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:54.780]   But I'd rather pay $5 or $10 to cash a check than run the risk of my wages being
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:59.540]   garnished and 50 percent of my income being taken in a wage garnishment order.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.380]   You've got to protect yourself and protect your family.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:05.860]   Again, I put – this is in the situation – when people are in a situation, they don't
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:06.860]   eat.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:11.460]   I'm sorry, but it's more important that you eat and that your children eat and that
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:14.540]   your lights are on than that your creditor get paid now.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.380]   As long as you're taking responsibility for your debt and you're going to pay it
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:21.880]   when you can, I'm OK with that.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:28.540]   But I put some of this stuff in the world of taking somebody's coat and making them
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:33.260]   be cold at night because you're taking their coat for security, that we must not take advantage
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.380]   of people who are poor and destitute.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.140]   We've got to make sure that – especially when someone is struggling – that the basic
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.580]   needs are cared for.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:46.020]   Now there are exceptions to what I'm saying and that advice would be important for you
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:51.820]   to pay attention to depending on what your source of funds are.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:56.180]   There's a difference between what are called protected funds and unprotected funds.
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:00.740]   Generally money that you earn from wages working at a job are unprotected funds.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.700]   Those funds are available for the claims of your creditors.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:12.740]   But funds – income that you receive under some form of government assistance program
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:18.420]   such as Social Security or veterans' benefits or unemployment compensation, those funds
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.780]   are protected funds and they are not legally attachable.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:25.100]   They cannot be taken by your creditors.
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.900]   And so what you should do with those types of funds is make sure that those funds actually
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:35.220]   are put in via direct deposit.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:40.180]   Because if a bank receives an attachment order or a garnishment order from the court, it
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.620]   has to look – the bank is required to look at the account and try to find out what is
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.720]   the source of the direct deposits that are there.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.100]   So if the source of the direct deposits are coming from the Social Security Administration,
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.020]   then they look down and they know that that's protected funds.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:59.020]   If the source of the direct deposit is coming from wages, they know that's not protected
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.120]   funds.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.520]   So you want to make sure that something like Social Security funds are direct deposited
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.020]   into your account because that is protected.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:15.300]   If you received your Social Security funds physically by a check and then you went and
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:21.340]   deposited that at check, now we have a problem because the bank can't see automatically
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:25.060]   that that is – that that check was Social Security.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.940]   So they're going to freeze the account and you have to claim and you will have to proactively
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:34.940]   prove your right to having those funds released and then ultimately they can be released.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:39.020]   So the bottom line is if you're receiving some form of government assistance income,
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.420]   Social Security, veterans' benefits, unemployment, make sure that those funds are deposited via
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.780]   direct deposit.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:48.860]   Do not mix those funds with other money.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.340]   If you're using bank accounts, set up a new bank account or use a bank account exclusively
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:14:00.100]   for your Social Security income and your protected funds because when the money is commingled,
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.180]   now we've got a problem.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:06.180]   Now Social Security funds will keep their protection even if they were commingled but
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.720]   now we wind up in a situation where the burden of proof is on you.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.520]   So you should keep Social Security income in a separate account and do not mix it with
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:22.140]   any other income that you have in order that it retains its ongoing protection.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.540]   Same advice applies to retirement accounts.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.700]   Retirement accounts – quick clarification.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:32.780]   There are certain retirement accounts that are covered by what's known as the ERISA
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:38.860]   regulation, ERISA, E-R-I-S-A, Employee Retirement Income Security Act I think.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:44.380]   So this would include your big accounts, just 401(k)s, 403(b)s, et cetera.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.500]   Any tax-qualified account that's governed by ERISA.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:52.220]   But ERISA does not govern individual retirement accounts, Roth IRAs, et cetera.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.900]   Those are governed by state law.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:59.420]   ERISA accounts have essentially ironclad protection from the claims of creditors.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:06.020]   So money that's in your 401(k) or 403(b) is very, very safe from the claims of creditors
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:10.580]   and you should be very careful with those funds.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:14.260]   One of the things that frustrates me to no end is when people take money who are in a
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:20.980]   problem situation, they take money that is in a 401(k) and use it to pay off their creditors
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:27.580]   while also recognizing that that may put them in a situation where they can never get free
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.100]   of the debt and they can never have that money back.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.420]   Money that's in your 401(k) will stay with you right through bankruptcy court.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.660]   Again this is where I'm getting clear.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.500]   I want you to pay your creditors but we got to make sure that you're also protected
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.540]   and that you're not left destitute by doing so.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:46.380]   And so individual circumstances here are very important.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.980]   In general, if you are in a financially contentious situation, you want to keep your money to
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.300]   the greatest extent possible in ERISA-governed accounts.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:16:00.060]   I would keep money out of 401(k) and not roll it over into an IRA.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:04.780]   Now most US states have established their own legislation for protection for IRAs.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.140]   But sometimes they have certain dollar amounts.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   Some states have stronger protection than others but they have certain dollar amounts.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.660]   So you want to be very careful.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:16.420]   But the same thing applies to distributions from retirement accounts.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.460]   As long as your money is in the retirement account, it's protected from the claims of
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:21.620]   creditors.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:26.780]   But if it starts to be distributed from retirement accounts, be very careful.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.820]   Now it should be protected.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:33.580]   The income flow from an account, in my understanding, should be protected but it won't be protected
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.100]   if it's commingled with other funds.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.460]   So separate your funds, separate your accounts and keep those things separate so that you
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.540]   can have – the proof is available for you.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:48.260]   And some of those things will be governed by state law as well.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.140]   So be very, very careful.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.420]   By the way, there are times where I believe that you should take money from retirement
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.500]   accounts to pay your creditors.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.900]   But in extreme situations, especially if somebody is going to wind up in bankruptcy court, then
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.500]   that may not be advisable at all and we need to be very, very careful.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:12.020]   So these are just some tactics and let me try to give you a few more discussions on
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.400]   wages.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.520]   Keep the source, protect your wages.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.540]   Keep your wages as quiet as possible.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.280]   Don't announce the source publicly.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.260]   Some of this, when you get into a contentious situation, you're hiding from a private investigator.
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:30.260]   When a court judgment is taken out against you, you're hiding from a private investigator.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.740]   So for most people, it's pretty easy.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.140]   You owe money.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.580]   You don't have the money to pay right now.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.220]   I'm assuming you don't have the money to pay.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.220]   You've just got enough money that you're putting together.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:45.700]   But if you go and update your LinkedIn status to say that now I work at company ABC, an
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:55.340]   investigator finds it very easy to go to company ABC and deliver the wage garnishment order.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.980]   But if you very quietly took a job at company XYZ and nobody knew you were there at company
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:05.420]   XYZ, now you have the possibility to start to accumulate some money so that you can use
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:11.620]   it to pay your bills, to keep your family housed and fed and clothed, and then you can
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.240]   go ahead and start making payments.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.460]   And you need to protect your money and fight like crazy to make good settlements.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:23.520]   One of the things that you want to do is you want to be in as much control as possible
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.940]   of the process.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.820]   And you may need to accumulate funds in order to settle with creditors.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:36.500]   Let's say that you owe $10,000 on a bill and you have five people that you owe $10,000
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.500]   to.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.500]   You owe $50,000.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.780]   Well, you need to start accumulating money and start making offers to try to settle with
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.940]   your creditors.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:48.820]   Settling is an entirely reasonable thing to do.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.840]   Remember, your creditor has the choice to always settle or not settle with you.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.660]   And so it's morally upright and morally fine for you to forgive any debt that you want
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.820]   and your creditor can do that as well.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.300]   So a debt can be forgiven.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.300]   That's fine.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.260]   And that can also be settled.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.980]   And so if you're in a situation where you're offering money, you may need to accumulate
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:09.980]   this money.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:14.820]   It can be dangerous for you to accumulate that $5,000, $7,000, $8,000, $10,000 in the
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:20.060]   bank, which you're going to use to settle with creditor number three because they'll
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.260]   give you the best offer right now.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:26.900]   You can't afford to have this other creditor come in and invade your bank account.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:33.420]   And you can't afford to have your wages garnished by this low-priority creditor, which puts
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.580]   you in a situation where you're not making your mortgage payment.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.980]   Let me give you – tell you practically why this is so important.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.380]   Your only debts – pretend for a moment.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:47.680]   Your only debt is a mortgage payment and an unsecured credit card.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.580]   Your family lives in the house that you're in and you don't have the opportunity to
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.800]   sell the house and move somewhere else and have that be an ideal living situation.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.780]   You don't – it doesn't make sense for you to sell the house and try to use proceeds
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:01.060]   to pay off the debt.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.780]   And so you're stuck in a situation.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:03.780]   Maybe you got hurt.
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:04.780]   Maybe you're underemployed.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:05.780]   You can't find a job.
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:09.300]   You're stuck in a situation where you can barely make your mortgage payments, but you
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.560]   can't pay the credit card.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:19.580]   The priority here is staying in the house and protecting the living needs of your family.
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:20.580]   Now fast forward.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.580]   The credit card is unpaid.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.660]   They're unpaid for a couple of years.
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.660]   They sue you.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.300]   They've got a judgment against you.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:32.840]   Now they have the right to come and to invade your house – sorry, and to invade your assets
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.060]   and to try to collect any valuable personal property.
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:38.780]   They have the right to send the sheriff to try to pick up your boat, sell the boat at
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.780]   auction.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.660]   Hopefully you've done that by now to get rid of the boat and pay the bills.
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:46.260]   But this is the legal situation which you find yourself.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.960]   You can't afford to have your wages garnished and then not be able to pay your mortgage
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.100]   payments so that you lose your house.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.180]   You've got to figure out another plan.
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.420]   The best plan is get an extra job.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.540]   If you send the credit card company, stay out of court.
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.520]   Send the credit card company little bits of money and accumulate money and make a settlement
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.300]   with them and get them paid off.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:07.600]   That's the best plan.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.180]   But you've got to make sure that you're protected.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.820]   Or if you're working with someone else, make sure that you're helping them understand
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:14.340]   how to prioritize and protect themselves.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.640]   So keep the source of your wages quiet.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.620]   Don't publish it on LinkedIn.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.620]   Cash your checks.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.620]   Don't put them in the bank.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:23.280]   And protect your business and your side income.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.380]   Understand how wage attachments work.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.660]   This is a big, big deal.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.780]   So again, you have a creditor.
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.780]   They sue you.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.840]   They gain a judgment against you and they now become a judgment creditor.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:38.420]   The first thing most judgment creditors are going to go after is your paycheck through
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.540]   a wage garnishment.
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:45.940]   Now this is a very effective technique if you receive a regular paycheck from an employer
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.420]   because they're the very first person to be paid.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:53.120]   Your employer takes a certain amount out of your paycheck and they send it off to your
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.880]   creditor and you never have a chance to say anything about it.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:03.760]   Now federal law allows a judgment creditor to take up to 25% of your net earnings, up
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:12.600]   to 25% of your net earnings, or the amount by which your weekly net earnings exceed 30
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.020]   times the federal minimum wage.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:24.440]   So at a $7.25 an hour wage, 7.25 times 30 is $216.50.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:31.620]   So they can take any amount that exceeds $217.50 per week, whichever of those is less.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:37.360]   So either 25% or any amount – 25% of your earnings or any amount that exceeds 217.50
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.560]   per week, whichever is less.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.800]   That's the federal law.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.520]   There are some states that have a little bit more protection as well, but that's the
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.520]   federal law.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:53.560]   That's a huge amount of money that somebody could take, 25% of your net earnings.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.200]   And then for some kinds of debts, it can actually be more.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.000]   Child support for example allows – if you're behind on child support and you haven't
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.080]   paid your child support, up to 50% of your wages may be taken to pay your child support.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.720]   That's a significant scenario.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.140]   Income taxes as well.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.920]   If you don't pay your income taxes and you ignore your communication with the IRS to
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:22.320]   collect the taxes that you owe, they can take basically all of your wages.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:28.760]   There's a formula that they can use but it can wind up with you getting as little
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:36.320]   pay as 180 bucks a week and there's a real problem with that.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.920]   So wage attachments and garnishments are no joke.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:44.160]   This is a huge deal and you want to make sure that you avoid that.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.080]   The judgment creditor sends the sheriff.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.720]   The sheriff notifies your employer.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:53.800]   The employer lets you know and unless you have some legal course of fighting it, from
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.600]   now on your employer is going to send that money out.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.320]   Now you're going to have to pay the money.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.480]   I'm just encouraging you.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.240]   Try to do everything you can to avoid this circumstance and there's no reason why you
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.240]   need to make it easy on them.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:13.160]   You need to protect your wages and in these circumstances probably your best source of
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.680]   income is to have some sort of side income or business income that is not easily found
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.880]   so you can have extra money.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.120]   But you don't want to have your wages garnished.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   Protect your wages.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.240]   Keep it private.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.860]   Work like crazy and save money so that you can pay your debts.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:30.080]   You need to protect your property when you're in this situation.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.480]   And so your first course of action is for you to probably seriously consider selling
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.840]   any personal property yourself in order to pay your debts.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.640]   As quickly as you can deal with things, the better.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.440]   The problem that people face is when they don't pay their debts and then it gets worse
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.800]   and worse and worse.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:53.120]   But at every stage of this process, you're better off if you move fast and if you pay
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.760]   your debts quickly.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.480]   So if you start to go behind and you start to know you're going to be behind, let's use
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:05.400]   a car as the best example because car repossession is something that happens to a lot of people.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.880]   If you're missing one payment on a car, don't hang out, not worry about it.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.120]   Freak out and get busy.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.880]   If you find yourself missing one car payment, the immediate question is why and is this
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.120]   going to change?
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.960]   If you're going to be late on your car payment, if you're going to be late on a mortgage payment,
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.680]   you should freak out and start the analysis of what's going on.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.560]   Now it may be that you're late on your car payment and you can't pay the car payment
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:36.280]   right this second because there was an unexpected one-time bill that showed up unexpectedly
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   or a bank error or something like that.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.580]   Well, in that situation, you want to analyze it but it may not be the best to sell the
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.280]   car right off the bat.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:47.720]   But if you're one payment late or you just lost your job and you think you're going to
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:54.340]   be one payment late, freak out and start selling your property yourself.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:58.440]   You don't want to dilly-dally around and wait a few months and all of a sudden wind up in
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.800]   a situation where you're hiding your car from the repo man.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:06.680]   You want to avoid repossession if at all possible because you're going to be better off selling
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.120]   things on your own.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.400]   So if you think you may not be able to make your car payment or if you missed a car payment,
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:17.760]   put that car on the market and start looking like crazy to figure out how to sell it and
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.900]   make sure that you retain control of it.
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:24.640]   Now if it's been a few months, for example, and you still can't sell it, then I would
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.360]   hide it from the repo man.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.040]   If you buy – you got to figure out how to do it in terms of how people find things like
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.520]   cars depending on where you're doing.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.760]   They just come to your house.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   They come to your job.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.440]   They figure out where you're driving.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.960]   If you're shopping at buy here, pay here places, a lot of times a lender will have
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.340]   a GPS unit on the car.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.120]   So you got to figure out how to do it.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.220]   But you want to sell the car privately.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:52.960]   If you allow your personal property to be repossessed, then your creditor is going to
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.320]   take it and they're going to sell it themselves and they're not going to hold out for the
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.740]   best price.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:02.040]   But often if you go into the private market, you may be able to sell it for more and it's
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.080]   always going to be in your best interest to sell it at the highest price that you can
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.200]   buy.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.560]   So make sure that you're doing everything you can to make sure that your property is
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.680]   not taken from you and sold without your control.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.400]   So that means move fast and you sell it quickly in order to pay off the debt.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.720]   If you owe more – you're probably going to owe more on the car than it's worth or
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.520]   owe more than you can sell it for.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.120]   You may have to borrow the difference, but it's a whole lot easier to borrow – you
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:32.200]   own a $15,000 car that you sell for $13,000.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.560]   It's a whole lot easier to go to your friend or family member and say, "Can I borrow $2,000
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:43.100]   from you and get rid of the $13,000 debt than it is to wind up having the car company repossess
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.100]   the car?"
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:49.720]   They sell it at auction for $9,000 and now they sue you for $6,000.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.960]   If you're in a situation, do your best to protect your property.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.700]   And if a creditor has gone all the way to the point where they're now a judgment creditor,
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:05.020]   they can do a lot of stuff to find and to take your property.
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.380]   Most of the time this is pretty easy.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.540]   They just come by your house and look to see what you have.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:14.460]   And they can – if you have a home and you're facing a judgment creditor, they can record
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.980]   a lien on your home.
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:18.180]   They can take the money out of your bank account.
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:21.420]   They can come by and they can find out that you have a boat sitting in the front yard
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.260]   and they can go ahead and say, "Listen, you got to sell that boat."
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.340]   And they have all kinds of ways that they can do it.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:30.700]   Once they become a judgment creditor, they can go and they can take out – they can
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.340]   find information from the DMV, the Department of Motor Vehicles.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:39.560]   They can find out information about what things are registered to you.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.060]   They can go and they can look through all of the paperwork that you've given to them
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:45.180]   for the original loan application.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.860]   They can look at your credit reports of assets owned or liabilities owned.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:54.460]   They can look at what you had when you told them where you live, the name and address
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:29:00.180]   of your employer, all of the information about everything that you own.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:03.380]   They can – they have tremendous opportunities.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.940]   And then again, at the end of the day, if they can't find any property, they can force
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:12.040]   you to show up in court for a debtor's examination where they require you to show up and testify
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:15.180]   about what you own, the assets that you have.
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.780]   They can take advantage of social media.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.300]   You're on the social media posting about all the fancy stuff that you have and there
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.620]   are pictures of you on your Facebook profile.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:30.860]   All of that can be used as evidence by your creditors to find your stuff and force the
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.260]   sale of your stuff.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:39.180]   They can force you to bring them your tax returns, your bank statements, all of the
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.240]   information on your business activities.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.300]   You want to make sure that you protect your property and stay out of this by you selling
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.340]   stuff quickly and paying your debts.
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.640]   You want to make sure that you protect your property by keeping it clear of liens as much
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.120]   as possible.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.860]   When you have a judgment creditor that wins a lawsuit against you, they can start to put
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.780]   liens on your property and that's a real problem.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:05.640]   So do everything you can to fight and make sure that you avoid the liens.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.900]   The simplest way to get out of this mess is pay your debts.
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   Pay your debts as quickly as you can and pay your debts as much as you can.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:24.820]   This process is very, very difficult and expensive for creditors to do.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:26.820]   Think about what it would take to send a private investigator.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:30.820]   If you owe somebody $1,000 on a credit card and that's your only debt, they're not going
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:34.100]   to send a private investigator to your house to take pictures of your boat and try to force
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.620]   the court to sell your boat.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.620]   It's not going to happen.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.100]   It costs too much in manpower and it's just not worth it.
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.860]   They'll sell that debt to a bill collector for $500.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:46.780]   They'll write off the loss and the bill collector will harass you on the phone until you send
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.180]   them a couple hundred bucks.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:54.780]   But all through the process, the fastest way out of this mess is pay your debts.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:31:00.500]   And most of your creditors, if you will communicate with them, will be willing to work with you.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:05.220]   Remember, you're dealing with a person and the person just wants their money.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.420]   And if they think that there's a chance that they're going to get their money, they'll
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.860]   work with you.
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:13.660]   Now they've got certain tools and techniques that they know are going to allow them to
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:17.540]   have more strength in the negotiation process.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.460]   And depending on how strong their position is, the more or less likely they will be to
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.460]   work with you.
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:26.820]   Your landlord, if they're a good landlord, is probably going to start eviction proceedings
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:31.620]   immediately as soon as is allowed by state law so that they have that legal pressure
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.740]   against you.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:37.420]   Your mortgage company has no incentive to take partial payments on your mortgage payments
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:41.580]   because they know they can take the house and they've got an ironclad ability to foreclose
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.580]   on you if you don't take it.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:46.220]   But if you'll communicate with people, they don't want to take the house.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.280]   The mortgage company doesn't want to take the house.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.640]   They just want their money.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.260]   Your landlord doesn't want to kick you out.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.820]   They just want their money.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:57.000]   So communicate and make payments as possible.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.880]   People are real human beings.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.740]   And if you just simply pay as much as you can oftentimes and negotiate with people and
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:08.100]   do the best you can and demonstrate your fidelity, demonstrate your character, the fact that
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:13.400]   you're going to stand good for your debt, they'll probably be willing to work with you.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:16.780]   And then if you pay quickly and you make small payments and you work out a new payment plan
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:21.260]   and you negotiate, you can forestall a lot of this stuff.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:26.980]   So pay your debts as quickly as you can, as you're able.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:31.260]   Increase your income, cut your expenses and pay your debts.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:35.540]   Don't borrow any more money, but pay your debts.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.100]   Just pay your debts.
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:40.340]   I don't have anything smarter to say than that.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:45.140]   There are times where if you'll think strategically, you can make adjustments.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.900]   For example, sometimes you can just pay your debts by returning the collateral.
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:53.340]   If you're dealing with a small thing, return the property that was used as security.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:56.020]   Sometimes you can negotiate your debts and saddle them with somebody.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.180]   But pay your debts.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:00.780]   And then finally, a couple of quick things.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:04.220]   Protect your family while you're working your way through the process and do the best you
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:07.820]   can to keep the financial stress out of your family as much as you're able.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:12.740]   I think it's wise that everyone in your family knows that you're under financial stress so
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:15.060]   that everyone can tighten their belts.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.380]   Family members may need to get extra jobs.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:20.260]   That's going to require hardship.
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:21.260]   Kids may need to go to work.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.380]   Spouses who stay at home may need to go to work.
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.180]   They may need to work extra jobs.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:29.340]   But try to keep the financial stress from breaking apart your marriage.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:32.960]   Financial stress is a huge component in breaking up marriages.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:36.180]   And protect your family from that.
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.020]   That's why for me it's a big deal.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.300]   Keep the bill collectors out of the house and away.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.540]   And keep those fights shielded with them.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:46.620]   I can fight really, really well with people.
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.620]   I'm good at it.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:53.940]   I can stand up and I can yell and I can argue and I can write nasty letters and I can fight.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.500]   But I don't want that to happen in my living room and that stress to be pushed onto my
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.940]   wife and to my children.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.340]   They need to know we're in stress.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:06.260]   But I'm going to keep those fights as insulated as possible and help to protect the peace
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.420]   of my house.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:11.660]   Prioritize your spending to focus on the important things first.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.380]   Make sure that if at all possible you pay your rent.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.000]   Don't get kicked out on the street.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.020]   You think it's bad to fight with a bill collector.
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:26.700]   It's a whole lot worse when you're living in your car with kids and dogs.
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.180]   So fight.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.380]   But take care of things first.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:34.260]   And do everything you can to stay out of court as quickly as possible.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:38.500]   I always – that was funny.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:42.220]   I think of this frequently when it comes to financial counseling.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:45.940]   When Jesus was preaching in the book of Luke, Luke chapter 12, he said this.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.900]   He said, "When you're on your way to court with your accuser, try to settle the matter
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.700]   before you get there.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:57.060]   Otherwise your accuser may drag you before the judge who will hand you over to an officer
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.260]   who will throw you into prison.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:03.140]   And if that happens, you won't be free again until you've paid the very last penny."
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.160]   That's from Luke chapter 12.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.700]   There is no place that that statement is more accurate than dealing with debt and paying
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.240]   your debts.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:15.580]   So when you're on your way to court with your accuser, try to settle the matter and
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:19.740]   come to your own agreement quickly before you get there.
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:24.580]   Otherwise your accuser may drag you before the judge who will hand you over to an officer
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.020]   who will throw you into prison.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:29.460]   And if that happens, you won't be free again until you've paid the very last penny.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:34.820]   Now we need to talk in closing here about bankruptcy and about keeping financial records.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:40.260]   It's very important that you do good research about bankruptcy.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:45.740]   And if you're in a hardcore situation, bankruptcy is very important for you to understand and
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.020]   for you to get good advice on.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:53.460]   Being knowledgeable about the bankruptcy code is important and it is wise.
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:36:04.380]   And I hate seeing people abused who cause major problems when if they were knowledgeable
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:08.260]   about bankruptcy planning, they would be well-served.
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:13.140]   The clearest example I can give you is if you're in extreme financial duress, do not
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:18.660]   pay debts that can be cleared in bankruptcy with assets that will survive bankruptcy,
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:24.820]   i.e. don't take money out of your 401(k) to pay your credit cards.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.620]   When your credit cards can be discharged in bankruptcy and your 401(k), you won't lose
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:31.100]   it.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.940]   Now what about your moral obligation?
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.820]   That's why I spent so much time on that.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.300]   You need to pay your debts.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:43.780]   And so if you have $100,000 in your 401(k) and you owe $5,000 on your credit cards, then
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:47.820]   I'm going to tell you every single time, take a distribution from your 401(k) and pay
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:50.140]   the stupid credit cards.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:56.580]   But if you have $5,000 in your 401(k) and you owe $100,000 in credit cards, do not take
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:00.540]   $5,000 out of the 401(k) to pay the $100,000 in credit cards.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.540]   You need that protection because you're going to need that money to establish yourself and
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:13.660]   to be able to pay a first last in security on the next apartment that you rent.
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.360]   Bankruptcy can be very important.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.660]   Bankruptcy especially, it's important that you understand that bankruptcy may be a way
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.300]   for you to do something like stop your foreclosure.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:28.200]   With bankruptcy, I'm not going to do in detail on today's show, just no time.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:36.960]   But with bankruptcy, there are two types of bankruptcy that are appropriate for individual
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.960]   borrowers.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.220]   There's what's called chapter 7 bankruptcy and there's what's called chapter 13 bankruptcy.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:49.400]   In essence, chapter 7 bankruptcy is a complete wiping of your debts.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:52.240]   That's where your creditors receive nothing.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:57.720]   Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a payment plan system where certain creditors receive certain things
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.440]   and certain creditors don't.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.120]   But the bankruptcy court protection is very, very important, especially for people who
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.000]   are very vulnerable.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.320]   It's important that you understand if you're facing difficult circumstances, talk to somebody
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.560]   knowledgeable about bankruptcy.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:18.160]   Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be a way of stopping a foreclosure and of reworking out a payment
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.400]   program.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.640]   Bankruptcy is not just as simple as saying, "Well, I'm not going to pay my money.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:24.640]   I'm not going to pay my debts.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.600]   I'm just going to declare bankruptcy and walk away."
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.760]   Yes, there are those circumstances in which it's so impossible that that's exactly what
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.080]   happens.
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.720]   And there are debts that we can accumulate that simply can never be paid.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.000]   And that's why bankruptcy court is so important.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.680]   When somebody lends you money, they are taking a risk.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.300]   They're taking a risk and they're going into it with their eyes wide open.
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.600]   And they should take that risk.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.280]   And one of those risks is that you may not pay and bankruptcy court is there.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.140]   I don't want you to walk away from your debts, but I want you to pay your debts.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:02.360]   But frankly, there are many situations in which we can never pay the debts that we owe.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.400]   And that's why bankruptcy court is so important.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.960]   Bankruptcy court is important because it gives you the opportunity to stop certain actions.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.080]   If you're facing a difficult circumstance, you're facing foreclosure, for example, you
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.300]   seriously need to understand how chapter 13 bankruptcy works and consider a consultation
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.960]   with a bankruptcy attorney.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:27.580]   A chapter 13 bankruptcy is a very valuable tool for you to stop a foreclosure proceedings
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:31.980]   and for you to put yourself in a situation where you can renegotiate and come up with
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.620]   a new payment plan.
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:40.020]   And a chapter 13 bankruptcy is one where it puts you in a situation where you can make
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:43.980]   payments under – with a bankruptcy – what's the name for it?
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:45.980]   The steward, the supervisor.
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:52.260]   I'm blanking on the name, but the court-appointed person who will make sure that you can pay
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.820]   a certain amount and they'll work with you and they'll help you to put yourself in
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:00.860]   a situation where you can pay a reasonable amount of your income.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:04.420]   If you're making $50,000 per year and you're supporting a family and you have a whole lot
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.900]   of debt, you can never put yourself in a situation where you're going to put 75 percent of
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:13.780]   your income to pay creditors and you may need the bankruptcy court protection in order for
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:16.060]   you to pay those bills.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:19.260]   And they'll rework it, they'll negotiate, you'll negotiate the amount down and you'll
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:25.980]   work out a payment plan that puts you in a situation where you can work your way out.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:30.180]   Chapter 7 bankruptcy is also very, very valuable for you to understand and there are circumstances
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:31.980]   in which it's important for you to know that.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:38.140]   Today's show is not about bankruptcy, but I want to emphasize to you that you must understand
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.260]   and research this stuff.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:45.540]   And my heart hurts so much because frankly the people that get abused every day by the
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:48.220]   financial system are people who are clueless.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.900]   And you wind up in a mess because you're clueless.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.900]   You didn't, nobody sat down and taught you how to balance a checkbook.
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:57.440]   And so you did 10 years of stupid stuff and never balanced your checkbook and you wound
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.280]   up with a long list of debts.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.960]   And because you're never in the habit of going and seeking out financial advice, you never
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.220]   thought to ask somebody for advice.
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:09.760]   And because you never got good advice, you didn't know what you could do when you first
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.940]   fell behind on your first month and you didn't know what you could do in month six and you
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:17.140]   didn't know what you could do in months 12 and your life is being destroyed by people
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.900]   who actually know how to understand the law.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.060]   So stop being clueless and ask for help.
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:24.220]   That's my point.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.220]   Ask for help.
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:31.500]   If you're listening to this show and you're not clueless, I beg you, extend help to people
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:39.620]   who are clueless and try to help them because when somebody is facing an overwhelming circumstance
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:44.880]   and they're facing bill collectors calling all the time, it can be a very lonely place
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.680]   to be.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:52.840]   And I'm sick and tired of people being abused because they don't know their rights and they're
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:57.160]   not being fought for and the bullies are destroying their life.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.520]   So please help them.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.720]   Go and pay for a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:08.040]   Help them to sit down and understand what's available to them.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.680]   Cruelty is not an unforgivable sin.
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.100]   It's not the end of your, even your financial life.
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.720]   There are all kinds of things that you can do.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.920]   Now none of us want to enable people who are abusers of the system, but frankly, most people
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.120]   are not.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:26.040]   Most people are wanting to do the best that they can with what they've got.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:32.440]   Finally, I just, if you're in the situation, when you get this thing cleaned up, and I
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.680]   promise you, you can do it.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.480]   May take years, but you will feel better once you get on track and you start to get these
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.560]   things done.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.200]   May take years, but you will be in good shape when you're on the other end and you'll feel
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.520]   proud of what you've done.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.960]   You'll feel proud of the fact that you stood good for what you owed and that you made restitution
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:55.720]   for your debts and that you fixed what you could.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.320]   You'll be very, very proud of that.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.780]   That protects your integrity.
[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:03.960]   And when this mess is cleaned up, you'll come out the other side with a set of habits that
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.880]   will put you on the path to long-term wealth.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.520]   I don't know how to cite the statistic, but I hear over and over and I see over and over,
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.240]   the average millionaire has been broke or bankrupt one or two or three times on their
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.480]   way to it.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:23.000]   It's not uncommon to find somebody who's been in a situation where they went broke, went
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.920]   completely bankrupt, and they're in a situation where they rebuilt it all.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.560]   So this is not the end of the road.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:34.800]   Don't roll over and die.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:42.760]   Stand up and fight and clear your name and clear your debts and live with integrity.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.360]   Now when this mess is cleaned up, make sure you know this, you would better keep your
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.560]   records for life and you better understand the law.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:57.240]   It's very important that you get very good at keeping these records and you understand
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:00.640]   how they can be used against you.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:06.880]   When somebody's deeply in a mess, the records can be sold and resold so many times that
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.880]   it becomes very confusing.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.400]   And you may have some debt that's a long time ago that was sold, they call it zombie debt.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.960]   It was sold against you and now all of a sudden you receive another claim from somebody and
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.880]   you need to be able to go back and show, "No, look, this claim was paid in full and it's
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.960]   done, paid in full."
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.840]   You need to dispute those debts quickly.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:34.480]   You must, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you have the legal right to require the
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:40.160]   debt collector to verify the amount and the validity of the debt, but you have to act
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:46.520]   quickly because when they contact you and you don't respond, that debt can become a
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.120]   valid debt because you don't respond.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.360]   So you better respond within that 30-day deadline and dispute the validity of the debt and check
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.280]   your records and you got to keep those records from now on.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.840]   If you don't, you'll wind up with problems.
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.960]   In closing today, let me give you just a couple of final suggestions.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:10.220]   This subject is – I hope I've conveyed to you there's a lot of specific knowledge
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:14.360]   that is very circumstantially dependent.
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.280]   Big difference if you have a social security income or wage income.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.680]   I've given you enough I think specific examples that you can understand.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.360]   My only hope in today's show is to give you kind of an overview, give you some useful
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.280]   tactics that I don't often hear discussed on this.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.760]   But I want to encourage you to look for help in your situation.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:39.360]   Try not to bear this alone because these topics are so specialized and so – there's a
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.760]   lot of particular information and there are huge differences in circumstances.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.000]   Every type of debt is different.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.440]   The structure of the debt is different.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:52.200]   The amount of the debt is different and you need discussion with advisors who can analyze
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.040]   your situation and try to present some circumstances.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.840]   I hate to see people declare bankruptcy who with a couple of years of hard work can avoid
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:04.000]   it by just paying off their debt and settling with their creditors.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.480]   I hate to see people work for years when the obvious example is bankruptcy and they need
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.120]   the bankruptcy protection.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.300]   There are big differences in the scale of the debt.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:18.680]   Some debt can be solved by a little bit of extra work and a little bit of penny-pinching.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.080]   Other debt can never be solved by that and it's only going to be solved by building
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.720]   an entirely new business that increases hugely.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.880]   So you need specific indication – sorry, specific help.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:30.880]   Self-help opportunities.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.000]   The very best self-help opportunity I would start you with is Nolo has a book called Solve
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.200]   Your Money Troubles, Strategies to Get Out of Debt and Stay That Way.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.920]   It's a very good book.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:46.160]   Again, it's called Solve Your Money Troubles, Strategies to Get Out of Debt and Stay That
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.160]   Way.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.120]   Nolo is wonderful in terms of the books that they produce.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.480]   It's a publishing outfit that produces all kinds of self-help books and they are fantastic.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.280]   I've never been disappointed with a Nolo title.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.500]   Solve Your Money Troubles, Strategies to Get Out of Debt and Stay That Way.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:06.480]   Number two, you should seriously look and consider engaging with a consumer credit counseling
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.540]   company.
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:13.520]   Sometimes this will gain you benefits but the best place to start with is the Consumer
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.300]   Credit Counseling Service or an organization that is affiliated with the National Foundation
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.440]   for Credit Counseling.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.520]   There are a lot of scams in the world of credit counseling and a lot of people will sell you
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.280]   things that simply aren't true.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.800]   But there are a lot of legitimate helpful people that can help you to figure out a good
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:35.160]   solution in certain things.
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.640]   So there are people that can help you with the IRS.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.040]   There are people that can help you negotiate with your creditors.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.120]   But look and consider working with a debt and credit counseling agency.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:49.400]   There is a 12-step program for – what's it called?
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]   Debtors Anonymous, I think.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.160]   There's a 12-step program for people who are significant debtors.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:00.120]   If you have a spending problem, then that would be very well worth your looking into.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:06.240]   If you are prone to overspending and your debt is the result not of a medical expense
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:14.600]   or a business failure but it's due to you just like to buy new tennis shoes at the mall
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:17.140]   every weekend, that's a problem.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.560]   So consider joining a 12-step program like Debtors Anonymous.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.020]   And finally, get legal help.
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:29.320]   You definitely – if you have significant amounts of debt that you owe, you owe thousands
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.800]   of dollars, then it's probably well worth your consideration to consider getting legal
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:40.060]   help and to consider bringing in a lawyer.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:42.600]   At the very least, try to find a consultation.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.920]   You may be able to find a consultation with a lawyer through a local legal aid society
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.040]   if you have low income.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:54.240]   Then you may be able to get help through a local legal aid office.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:49:00.640]   Sometimes there are legal clinics available that can work with you, whether that's through
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.680]   affiliate, through university, et cetera.
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.400]   Sometimes you may have legal protection offered through your company or through some kind
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:15.840]   of prepaid legal program or you may just go ahead and contact a lawyer.
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:18.960]   But a consultation with a lawyer can be very, very helpful.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:22.680]   Now consultation with a lawyer can be very, very helpful.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.680]   I'll just stop that.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.960]   I don't have to give caveats.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.160]   The majority of lawyers that I've interacted with are very good at their work and they're
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:34.080]   very good at understanding the particulars of your situation and they're good at giving
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.080]   advice.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.640]   So get counsel from as many people as possible.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.960]   And most of all, I encourage you, open up.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.600]   Open up about your problems to somebody else.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.960]   You're not the only one.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.960]   You're not alone.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.040]   It's not like everyone else has a perfect financial history and if you just keep up
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.960]   the facade, then everyone else will think that you're smart.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:56.880]   It's not the case.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.120]   Talk and get help.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.640]   And it's a whole lot easier to humble yourself and to talk and to get help.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:07.440]   And then a number of years from now, two years from now, you may be able to go into a new
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.780]   year celebrating being totally debt free and having paid off all your debts and cleaned
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:14.720]   everything up and your financial life can be totally different.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:15.720]   But get help.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.880]   Open up and ask for help.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.200]   I think that covers most of what I wanted to accomplish.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.160]   Kind of a bear of a show, a big one.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:29.000]   I hope this was useful to you and I beg you, for those of you who are not in this situation,
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.880]   take the time to get involved in other people's lives and help them.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:37.520]   The person who is the least likely to look for help is the person who is struggling the
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:38.520]   most.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:42.480]   It seems counterintuitive, but for whatever reason, that's where we face it.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:43.720]   Wouldn't you experience it?
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:48.000]   It's funny, oftentimes the unhealthiest person is the one who is least likely to go for medical
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]   advice.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.120]   It's the healthy person who is always getting medical advice.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.440]   We face the same thing in this world.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:56.040]   So I hope I've given you some tools and some ideas that may help you lower the stress as
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:59.080]   you work your way through this to pay off your debt.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:07.600]   Remember to go to HelloFresh.com, use the coupon code RPF30.
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.200]   There will be a few new shows here in December.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.840]   I'm trying to line up mainly for January, but I'll release a couple new shows and then
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.720]   I'll probably do some reruns here in December as I try to work on some stuff behind the
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:18.720]   scenes.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.720]   It was pretty sick last week.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:25.520]   My children were all sick last week, so our Thanksgiving vacation wound up being a little
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.520]   bit longer than we intended.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:41.080]   But thank you all so much for listening and I'll be back with you soon.
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:46.720]   This show is part of the Radical Life Media network of podcasts and resources.
