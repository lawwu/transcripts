[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:57.560]  , I've met a guy in a cigar shop years ago.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   I always enjoy hanging out in cigar shops.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   I meet so many interesting people.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   I was in a cigar shop and I start talking with this guy.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   There are certain types of people that if you go in on the middle of a weekday at around 11am, 10:30am into a cigar shop, the type of person that's there is either going to be, well, I've never met any financial losers. I never just broke people in cigar shops. They either work in a cigar shop or they work in a cigar shop.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.600]   They either are very wealthy and that's what they want to do or they're retired or they work a job that allows them this kind of life flexibility.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   They either are very wealthy and that's what they want to do or they're retired or they work a job that allows them this kind of life flexibility.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   I start talking with this guy who is sharing with me.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   I start talking with this guy who is sharing with me.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   At the time I was a financial advisor so I like to meet wealthy people in cigar shops and hope that they would like to hire me to give them advice on how to keep their wealth and make it grow.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   At the time I was a financial advisor so I like to meet wealthy people in cigar shops and hope that they would like to hire me to give them advice on how to keep their wealth and make it grow.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   We start talking and he had sold a trucking company.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   The story that he shared with me was that he started when he was totally broke.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:50.640]  , and he started by just working as a company truck driver.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   He got a job and what he just negotiated was his ability to live in the truck.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   He drove a lot but he lived in the truck and he didn't maintain any house.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   He drove constantly, lived in the truck, all of his expenses were provided by his job, saved all his money and then he bought his own truck.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.680]   And it was enough money for him to retire on the nub sum from the sale of the trucking company.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   Now don't be confused.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   He worked hard to make that happen.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   He sacrificed a lot.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   But a major component for him was the ability to eliminate housing expenses because of the fact that he lived in a truck.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   Now don't be confused.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   He worked hard to make that happen.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   He sacrificed a lot.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   But a major component for him was the ability to eliminate housing expenses because of the fact that he lived in a truck.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   Now don't be confused.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   He worked hard to make that happen.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   He sacrificed a lot.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   He sacrificed a lot.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   But a major component for him was the ability to eliminate housing expenses because of the fact that he lived in a truck.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   Now don't be confused.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   He worked hard to make that happen.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   He sacrificed a lot.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   He sacrificed a lot.

I meet the most interesting people at such a wonderful place. I love to show hospitality to others. I enjoy cooking. I enjoy hosting people. I enjoy meeting people. The kind of thing that for the right personality could be really wonderful. You live in a ranch and you have some cabins out back and that's a
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.580]   different variation of a bed and breakfast.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:46.600]  , or perhaps you take that idea and you develop a service business. Perhaps you work as a live-in nurse or a live-in au pair or a live-in teacher or tutor or a live-in chauffeur or a live-in butler. These are all different common jobs that provide for you
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:06:16.620]  , where housing is provided for you as part of your employment compensation. These things can be very very efficient. Very efficient tax wise very efficient for you in terms of your lifestyle and they really can provide a pleasurable pleasing lifestyle. That's it. It's very simple. Look around and see is there a way that you can get your housing provided by your work by your employer by your job.

[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   If there is consider pursuing an opportunity like that.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   The opportunities are out there. You just got to look for them.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.040]   The opportunities are out there. You just got to look for them.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   Remember that just because you're doing something like this doesn't mean you can't also build wealth.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.960]   Remember that just because you're doing something like this doesn't mean you can't also build wealth.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.640]   Just because you're living as a live-in au pair or a live-in butler.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   That doesn't mean that you can't also develop for yourself a huge investment portfolio of houses that are all rented out.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   That doesn't mean that you can't also develop for yourself a huge investment portfolio of houses that are all rented out.

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:07:16.660]   I think there's a lot of value in considering something like this.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.660]   So look for it. See if there's an opportunity that would fit you and perhaps that will help you to earn more, spend less and have more money to invest.
