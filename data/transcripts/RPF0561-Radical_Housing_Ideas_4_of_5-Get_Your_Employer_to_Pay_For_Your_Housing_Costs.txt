[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.520]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.000]   Continuing on today with our radical housing series, today is idea number four.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.680]   The idea is this.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   Is there a way that you can get your housing to be provided for you by your employer in
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.080]   some form or another?
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.400]   Of course, there are many ways that this can be done, many different permutations of this
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.560]   idea, but it's a powerful way for you to dramatically lower your living expenses.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.400]   It's a very efficient way with regard to tax efficiency and expense efficiency for you
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.560]   to provide a basic need for yourself, and it can provide a foundation for you to grow
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560]   your finances.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640]   Let's start with some obvious examples to kindle your creative thinking.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.160]   One example would be something like the military.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.400]   One of the great benefits of joining a military organization is that your basic living needs
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.640]   are provided for you as part of your contract.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.400]   If you were to join your country's military, they'll provide for you housing, they'll provide
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.600]   for you clothing, they'll provide for you food, they'll provide for you medical care,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.120]   and they'll provide all these things for you as part of your contract.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.520]   Now of course, you also, in response, commit your entire life and literally your life,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.680]   but you do get a good deal.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.620]   So yes, your wages might not be the biggest wages as compared to other types of wages,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.520]   but when you run the math on $30,000 wages with all of your expenses provided for you
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.560]   as compared to $50,000, but you're responsible for all of your expenses, you have a really
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.400]   neat opportunity.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.000]   But the military is not the only way this can happen.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.840]   There are some jobs where you wind up with your housing as provided for you as part of
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.000]   your job.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.120]   I met a guy in a, I was in a cigar shop years ago.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.600]   I always enjoy hanging out in cigar shops.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.000]   I meet so many interesting people.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.760]   So I was in a cigar shop and I start talking with this guy.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.000]   And there are certain types of people that if you go in on the middle of a weekday at
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.760]   around 11 a.m., 10.30 a.m. into a cigar shop, the type of person that's there is either
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   going to be, well, I've never met any financial losers.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.120]   I never met just broke people in cigar shops.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.680]   They either are very wealthy and that's what they want to do, or they're retired, or they
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.520]   work a job that allows them this kind of life flexibility.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   And so I start talking with this guy who is sharing with me.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.640]   And I, at the time I was a financial advisor, so I like to meet wealthy people in cigar
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   shops and hopes that they would like to hire me to give them advice on how to keep their
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   wealth and make it grow.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.840]   And we start talking and he had sold a trucking company.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.000]   But the story that he shared with me was that he started when he was totally broke.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   And he started by just working at a company truck driver.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.000]   He got a job and what he just negotiated was his ability to live in the truck.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.820]   And he drove a lot, but he lived in the truck and he didn't maintain any house.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.720]   So he drove constantly, lived in the truck.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.480]   All of his expenses were provided by his job, saved all his money, and then he bought his
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.920]   own truck.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.620]   And then he started to buy another truck and he built his own trucking company and he expanded
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.080]   it out and took him a number of years.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.280]   And then his payoff plan at the end, he sold the trucking company and it was enough money
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   for him to retire on the lump sum from the sale of the trucking company.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.720]   Now don't be confused.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.380]   He worked hard to make that happen.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.440]   He sacrificed a lot, but a major component for him was the ability to eliminate housing
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.720]   expenses because of the fact that he lived in a truck.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.280]   Now if you want something a little bit different, just recognize that there are all kinds of
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.920]   jobs that provide housing as a part of their job.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.560]   Whether you work on a big rig oil derrick in the middle of the ocean, or you work on
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.880]   a boat and you sleep on the boat, or perhaps you get a job such as an apartment manager
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.040]   and you manage a 50 unit apartment complex, but part of your compensation is the fact
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   that you get to live in one of the apartments rent free.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.680]   Now there are so many other ways you can do this and you can do this in your own business.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.860]   What about something like operating a bed and breakfast?
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.820]   Or what about where you own the house, you live in the house and you make your income
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.760]   from opening your house up to your guests?
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.320]   I love staying in bed and breakfasts.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.720]   I meet the most interesting people.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.920]   It's such a wonderful place.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.520]   I love to show hospitality to others.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   I enjoy cooking.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   I enjoy hosting people.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   I enjoy meeting people.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   It's the kind of thing that for the right personality could be really wonderful.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.840]   You live in our ranch and you have some cabins out back and that's a different variation
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.600]   of a bed and breakfast.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.280]   Or perhaps you take that idea and you develop a service business.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.520]   Perhaps you work as a live-in nurse or a live-in au pair or a live-in teacher or tutor or a
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.640]   live-in chauffeur or a live-in butler.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.960]   These are all different just common jobs that provide for you, that where housing is provided
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   for you as part of your employment compensation.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.620]   These things can be very, very efficient.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.920]   Very efficient tax-wise, very efficient for you in terms of your lifestyle and they really
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.200]   can provide a pleasurable, pleasing lifestyle.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   So that's it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   It's very simple.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.520]   Look around and see is there a way that you can get your housing provided by your work,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.820]   by your employer, by your job.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.960]   If there is, consider pursuing an opportunity like that.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.620]   The opportunities are out there.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.340]   You just got to look for them.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.320]   Remember that just because you're doing something like this doesn't mean you can't also build
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.200]   wealth.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.320]   Just because you're living as a live-in au pair or a live-in butler, that doesn't mean
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.440]   that you can't also develop for yourself a huge investment portfolio of houses that are
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.160]   all rented out.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.800]   Just means that you're satisfying your need for a place to live with your employment and
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.120]   you're doing it in a very efficient way.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.360]   I think there's a lot of value in considering something like this.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.880]   So look for it, see if there's an opportunity that would fit you and perhaps that will help
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   you to earn more, spend less and have more money to invest.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Thank you for listening.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.520]   You've honored me with your time and attention and I'm grateful for that.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.320]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.040]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.520]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.160]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   action on it.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.600]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.960]   to a life change.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.920]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.560]   So take action.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.240]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.840]   that you care about.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.000]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.480]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.960]   That helps the person that you are engaging with.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.600]   And it also helps you because teaching others is one of the most effective ways for you
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.200]   to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.440]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you and if you're gaining financial
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.160]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
