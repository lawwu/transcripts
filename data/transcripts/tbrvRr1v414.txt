[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Happy New Year.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.760]   2018 is here.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.640]   I can't believe it.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.260]   Thanks for joining us for another year, our sixth year of doing this podcast.
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.920]   Pastor John, I can't believe we've been doing this now for I think 230 weeks in a
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.360]   row, and of course, another new year is upon us, and that means Christians across
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.680]   the globe will be starting or restarting their read through the Bible in a year plan.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.360]   So I want to ask you, Pastor John, today, I'm going to put you on the hot seat
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.360]   myself and ask you, can you make a case for the discipline of
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.960]   reading the Bible in a year?
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.480]   Can you name the plan that you use and explain why you like it?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.960]   Explain the pace of reading, how it works, and maybe what you've learned about
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.320]   yourself and the plan from doing it for so many years.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.840]   The Bible reading plan that I have used more than any other over the years, and
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:06.240]   that I used right up to the end of 2017, is the Discipleship Journal Bible Reading
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   Plan.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.400]   That's what it's called.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.360]   And I just Googled it to make sure that you could get it.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.120]   And you can.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.360]   You can go online, just Google the Discipleship Journal Reading Plan.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.920]   Probably the top entry is going to be a free PDF.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.800]   And you can print it out and join me because I'm going to use it again in 2018.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.400]   You can also, it's baked into some online Bible programs like Logos.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.480]   I use Logos and read my Bible on my iPad.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.240]   And it has a little feature where when you're done, it just brings up the next
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.960]   day automatically, which is wonderful.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600]   The way it works is this.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.280]   Here's why I use it and why I recommend it.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.840]   There are four different places in the Bible where you read every day.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.040]   And by reading these four different places, you complete the entire Bible in
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.560]   one year.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.240]   Two of those places are in the New Testament.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.280]   Two of them are in the Old Testament.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.400]   One of the effects of having two readings from the New Testament and two from the
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.760]   Old is that two of the readings tend to be quite short because the New Testament
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.040]   readings would get you through.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.240]   The New Testament is much faster because it's a shorter book than the Old
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.920]   Testament.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.200]   Now, this has the great advantage of combining both a broad scope of reading
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.760]   and a narrow, intensified reading.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.640]   And I find that it's very important that we read the Bible in both ways.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.800]   We read the whole Bible, even though I know we are reading parts of it fast.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.040]   And not understanding everything we read because we're not stopping to look
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.200]   everything up or find out what things mean that we don't understand.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.000]   I get that.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.080]   That's true for me as well.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.160]   I still think it's important to cover the whole range and grow in understanding
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.680]   year after year rather than think we have to stop and understand everything we're
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   reading.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.080]   And it's important to slow down and meditate significantly, deeply over a few
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.360]   verses or a few phrases.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.520]   It's not easy.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   I admit it's not easy to maintain this balance of covering the whole and going
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.160]   deep in a few places.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.760]   But I just I think it's worth the try.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.240]   I think it's worth the effort to try to do both.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.720]   Here's another advantage of this discipleship journal reading plan.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.160]   Namely, it only schedules 25 days each month for Bible reading, which means that
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.520]   at the end of every month, there are five or six days with no assignments.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:02.960]   Now, this, I think, is a stroke of genius because most people give up reading the
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.720]   Bible in a year because by February they're behind and they say, well, there's
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.120]   no hope.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.680]   March, they're farther behind.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.560]   So they give up.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.720]   Whereas this plan gives you a gracious five or six days at the end of every month
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.600]   to catch up if you've fallen behind.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.120]   And if you happen to stay up, then you use those, this is what I do, for
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.720]   memorization or some other use.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   I love to take a psalm, say a psalm like Psalm 25 I worked on recently, and during
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.960]   those five days try to memorize the psalm that I wouldn't have time for maybe any
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.360]   other way.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.360]   OK, so that's what I do.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.440]   That's my plan.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.000]   I've used it for years and years.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.480]   We used to use it together as a church.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.800]   And if you've got a better way that suits you better, that is just fine.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.440]   I'm not saying this is the best way.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.000]   I'm saying it's a way that I've found helpful.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   The bigger question for me is, for us all, I believe, is not what method or plan you
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.160]   use, or even if you get through the whole Bible in a year.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.840]   That is not the main point.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.440]   The big issue is, why do you read your Bible and what happens when you read it?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.640]   So why do we care about daily Bible reading in the new year anyway?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   I think the ultimate goal of every Christian should be to glorify God in your life every
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.880]   day, or to use the words of Philippians 1:20, to magnify Christ in your body, whether you
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.960]   live or whether you die.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.640]   We exist ultimately on this planet to make God in Christ look magnificent, to make him
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.760]   look precious and valuable, to look like the supreme treasure that he is.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.280]   That's the goal of life, make God look like a treasure.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.560]   Now, how do we go about that?
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:12.680]   Since in our sin, even as believers in our sin, there's so much in us that is inclined
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.560]   to think or feel or act in ways that don't make Christ look great.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   The answer, how we do this, is that we have to see the glory of Christ.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.280]   See him as glorious.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:34.040]   See the magnificence and the value and the beauty and the greatness and the desirableness
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.440]   of Christ.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:44.160]   We have to see him for what he's really like, because you can't savor what you don't see.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:51.160]   You can't cherish and desire and love and enjoy and treasure what you're not aware of.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:59.320]   And if we don't desire and cherish and enjoy and savor and treasure Christ, we will not
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.200]   commend him as magnificent in what we feel and say and do.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.120]   Christ is most magnified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.960]   And we cannot be daily satisfied at the depths of our soul in Christ if we don't see him
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.280]   and savor him.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:30.920]   And my point is that can only happen by a steady meditation on the word of God in the
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.600]   Bible.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:40.720]   According to 2 Corinthians 4, the glory of Christ shines through the gospel, that is,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.240]   through the narrative, the story, the message of the good news of the scriptures.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.640]   We see the glory of Christ in the word of God.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.560]   We encounter him in scripture.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.720]   And then in 2 Corinthians 3.18, it says that in seeing the glory, we become transformed
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.640]   into the same glory, from glory to glory.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:12.120]   So if we're going to see the glory and savor the glory and become images of the glory for
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   others to see, we have to see Christ.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.280]   And it only happens as we meditate on the Bible.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.160]   But of course, I'm assuming something.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.000]   This implies reading the Bible in a certain way.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:40.280]   It means in this new year, at every point we are crying out over the pages of scripture
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:48.000]   that lie before us, we are crying out to God for the supernatural act of his spirit to
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.560]   open the eyes of our hearts to see spectacular, beautiful, glorious, wonderful, valuable
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.080]   things in the Bible.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.920]   The reason I read the Bible is because I am stone cold dead without Christ in his word.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.280]   But I want all my life, every part of it.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.880]   I want my life to be glorious.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.680]   I want life to be beautiful.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.200]   I want life to be vastly more than it is if I'm left to myself.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.280]   I want to see how astonishing reality is at every turn, in every person, every rock, every
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.160]   tree, every animal, every work of salvation.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.520]   And I know that left to myself, I am an absolute dud.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:45.360]   Dud, I am blank, nothing deep, nothing moving, nothing intense, nothing beautiful, nothing
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.280]   precious, nothing sweet or wonderful, just empty, blank, unmoved, coasting along from
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.200]   world, one worldly preoccupation to another.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:06.240]   There is one hope for John Piper in 2018, one hope that I would have eyes to see the
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.600]   God-entranced magnificence of everything, namely, that God would be pleased in my Bible
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.760]   reading to cause me to see the glory that is really there.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.480]   That's why we read our Bible, to see glory, to savor glory, to be shaped into the image
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:35.800]   of the glory of God, to show the glory so that God is magnified as we are satisfied
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.560]   in him.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:44.360]   So that's why I'm in the Bible every day and read it through the whole year.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.840]   And I really hope that you will join me.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   It is an awesome quest.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.200]   Yes, it is an awesome quest.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.480]   And thank you for this episode, this reading plan overview and why we read the Bible in
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.120]   the first place.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.160]   This is a wonderfully robust episode to launch our sixth year.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.520]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your week.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive and
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.480]   reach us by email with a question of your own, even questions that relate to how to
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.280]   better make scripture a part of your daily life.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:24.080]   You can do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.920]   Well, how do we go deep in one passage of scripture when we barely have time to read
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.640]   our Bible reading plan each week?
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.560]   It's a very common question we hear from busy parents and busy students.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.840]   And it's the question I will pose to Pastor John next time on Wednesday when we
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.360]   return.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.520]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.160]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   [END]
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160]   [END]
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   [END]
