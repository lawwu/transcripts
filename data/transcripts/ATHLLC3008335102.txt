[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.520]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.760]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.680]   who loves doing all the research to get the best experience in life without an
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.800]   expensive price tag.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.080]   So to make this happen, I sit down with the best experts each week, and I learned
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.400]   all their strategies, tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.800]   So if you hear the phrase cocktail party, you might think like me, 1960s, dressed up
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.160]   couples, sipping martinis on a Mad Men set.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.200]   But that's not exactly what my guest, Nick Gray, means when he says that almost
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.160]   everyone should be hosting cocktail parties.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.400]   Nick's the author of a new book called The 2-Hour Cocktail Party, How to Build Big
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280]   Relationships with Small Gatherings.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.040]   And he's on a mission to get people to have more parties, to make connections,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.960]   build friendships, and live a richer life.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.920]   Now, between kids and COVID, I haven't hosted many gatherings in a while, but
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.320]   when Nick told me he wrote his book for people like me and not for people who
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.560]   already host events all the time, I was really excited.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.840]   So we're going to get tactical in this conversation.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.800]   I want to hear why a cocktail party is a better way to get to know people than
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.160]   just having dinner, why Nick thinks name tags and icebreakers are non-negotiable
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   for parties, and I want to get a complete run through of everything you need to do
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.760]   to make an event easy and effortless from invites to food and drink to
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.920]   getting to leave on time.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.640]   But that's not all because Nick also founded a company called Museum Hacks to
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.800]   lead these renegade tours of museums like the Met in New York and others around the
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.320]   country.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.560]   It's been featured in all kinds of media from the Wall Street Journal to the New
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.320]   York Times.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.600]   And after a little research, I'm hoping I can take one of these tours soon.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.000]   But in the meantime, I will make sure we also get all his museum hacks today too.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.400]   And on top of that, Nick is an avid traveler and a fellow optimizer.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   So I'm certain we'll uncover some other hidden gems in this conversation.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.200]   So let's get started.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.480]   Nick, welcome to the show.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.880]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.520]   We're going to get real tactical today.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.960]   That's fantastic.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.880]   So I'm going to jump right in and just ask why cocktail parties?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.560]   You can get 80% of the benefits of hosting a dinner party with 20% of the work by
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.840]   hosting a cocktail party.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.440]   Now, anybody can write a book to teach you how to host one dinner party, but the
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.800]   reality is, is that most people will never do it again.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.240]   And dinner parties are too hard.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.360]   They're too complicated.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.520]   A lot of people give entrepreneurs this advice, like host a dinner party or host a
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.440]   mastermind.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.160]   And I think that's actually terrible advice for most people.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.000]   You get most of the benefits from hosting when you can actually make it a habit and
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.720]   something where you always have your next party on the calendar.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.560]   To do that, I built the easiest possible framework and formula for hosting events.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.400]   Okay, so I've looked at that formula and I know you have all these things, name tags,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   icebreakers, firm stopping times.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.080]   Why are they important and how do you actually get people to play along and agree
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.440]   to them?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.280]   Well, one of the first things is that the best day to host an event might not be the
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.200]   one that you think.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   For example, I highly suggest that everybody hosts their parties on Monday, Tuesday, or
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.520]   Wednesday nights.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.440]   Why those?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.720]   We can go into that if you want, basically because they're non-competitive social
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.120]   nights.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.760]   Most people don't have things going on.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   Second of all is I always give a stop time to my parties.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.680]   Two hours, there's a start time, there's an end time.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.080]   And there's hidden benefits in having a stop time, one of which is that it gets all
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   your guests to show up on time, right?
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.640]   When you're a host, that beginning hour when nobody really shows up, it's slow.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.560]   When you have a tight two-hour thing, then folks show up on time and you end the
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.280]   party when things are going well, so that your friends, guests, your colleagues, they
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.320]   want to come back the next time that you host.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.040]   And when you host regularly, is it always the same people or do people feel left out
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.840]   or how does that work?
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.680]   Great question.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.600]   I usually mix it up.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.320]   I'll do half repeat guests, half new guests.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.080]   You really get the best benefits when you're going through life.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.320]   Let's say that you're hosting a cocktail party once every six weeks.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.360]   Between those parties, you're meeting all these random people.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.520]   Here's why I did this, why I can change your listener's life.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.760]   We meet all these interesting people that we never do anything with, like you meet
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.360]   them, they're cool and you're like, oh, that person was interesting, but I'm not
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.600]   going to go out of my way to schedule a dinner with them.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.000]   I'm not going to go out of my way to schedule a one-on-one meeting or a hangout
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.480]   with them because life's busy and things happen.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.560]   When you have a cocktail party, you get to kind of collect all of those interesting
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   people that you meet through life and bring them back in and then almost audition them
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.000]   to see if you want to be friends with them or build a relationship, almost something
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.480]   like that.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.120]   I hope that doesn't sound bad.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.920]   No, no, it's funny.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.600]   We went to a birthday party for a kid named Jackson.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.560]   I'd never met Jackson my whole life.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.080]   My daughter has met him at the park with our au pair and we got this kind of invite
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.440]   through the nanny group to us.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.280]   And so we go to this party, we don't know a single person.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.600]   And now we just met, I don't know, 10 couples with our kid's age.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.920]   And I will share this because we didn't know what to do with them.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.960]   We're like, "You seem cool.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.080]   We've got kids the same age, but do we really want to orchestrate 10 playdates or
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.600]   group play?"
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.880]   It just seemed like we met these interesting parents and we didn't know what to do.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.960]   So you've sold me on the fact that dinner is not going to happen.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.560]   I'm not going to schedule 10 dinners because that's going to take me the next, I
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.120]   don't know, it feels like 10 months of dinners straight.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   I get why I should do it, but it seems like a lot of work.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.840]   So I'd love to just dial in like, how do you make this, you said 20% of the work of
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.560]   a dinner party.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.680]   How is that possible?
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.520]   Okay.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.160]   I found when I was scheduling dinners that first of all, you have to stress about all
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.640]   the food.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.400]   By the way, it's not about the food.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.960]   The hack is that if you are insistent on hosting a dinner party, just order out.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.760]   Don't try to cook the food yourself.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.040]   Nobody cares about the food.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.760]   They're coming for the people and for the conversation.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.640]   When you order out, it allows you to be a little less stressed about that.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   But how is it more efficient?
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   How can you get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the work?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.520]   Well, 80% of the benefits at a dinner party.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.560]   Have you read the book, the art of gathering by Priya Parker?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.840]   I have not.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   Absolutely fantastic book.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.440]   And in there, she says one thing that when you have a dinner party with more than six
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.080]   people, the conversation will naturally split into two smaller groups.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.760]   So if you have a dinner party with eight or dinner party with 10, the conversation will
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.480]   split unless you're doing Jeffersonian single track with a very skilled facilitator,
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.400]   moderator, the conversation naturally will split into smaller groups.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.280]   And so I generally would have a dinner party.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.520]   It's about six because that's easy to host.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.840]   I find that by hosting a cocktail party and by the way, the sweet spot, the number of
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.360]   people that you want to have attend is 15 to 20.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.520]   Why is that?
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.200]   Because less than 15, there's not enough energy.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.960]   There's not enough dynamic, new connections and possibilities.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.480]   If you have a group of 10 people over two hours, you can survey the room visually.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   And generally you'll talk to pretty much everybody with 15 people with 20 people,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   you probably won't get a chance to talk to everybody.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.840]   And it leaves this excitement and energy for all of your guests, especially in the
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.680]   room as well.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.760]   That is a little known fact that the more people you have, the easier it is for you
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.520]   as a host.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.600]   If you are hosting seven people, six people, there's a lot of work.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.560]   You're kind of always on.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.800]   You are the host at all the time.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.600]   When you're 15 to 20 people, you get to step back into the role of facilitator a
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.360]   little bit more.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.920]   And my book speaks a lot about that.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   I can share those facilitation tips and tricks for you.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.360]   But that's why for me, it's so much less work and I can connect with so many more
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.000]   people in the time it takes to watch a Netflix movie.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.840]   Okay.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.800]   So I've got the number of people, I've got the day of the week.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.360]   Is this send an evite or how do you get the people to the place and where do you do
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:37.440]   it?
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.200]   Just at your home?
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.280]   Do you rent a venue?
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.760]   I'm just going to go through all the questions I have because in my mind, I'm
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.320]   already starting to plan the next one.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.880]   Well, if you're open to it, can we just plan yours?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.240]   Can we just do that?
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.080]   And then I'll tell you step by step.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.400]   Okay.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.680]   So first step is you need to pick a day and you need to give yourself three to four
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.880]   weeks minimum in advance.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.160]   That's what I call the party runway.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.560]   It's so that you can fill up your guest list, have plenty of time to plan and
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.040]   prepare.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.680]   And so to do that, then you need to pick a date, a Monday or Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.760]   That's minimum three weeks in advance.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.800]   Do you have a date that would work for you?
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.680]   First time here.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.040]   Should I go like on the short end, four weeks?
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.640]   I got a date for you that works in August, about a month out.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.240]   Yes.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.440]   I probably have a date that works in September, like two months out.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.040]   August is it.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.920]   Let's do it sooner rather than later, because what a lot of people will say when
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.640]   they host this past, Oh yeah, that makes sense.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.520]   I'll do it.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.120]   And so I want to do it when it's perfect.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.960]   No hosting is something that we're going to do naturally and regularly.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.760]   We're not going to wait for it to be perfect.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.120]   And so I would even rather you do this first one sooner, just so you can see how
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   easy it's going to be.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.200]   And then you can do one that'll be even better later in September.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.920]   So if you have that date, what day of the week is it?
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.040]   Is it a Monday, a Tuesday?
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.000]   Okay, great.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.240]   Now you need to pick a two hour time block.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.360]   What two hours for me when I was in New York City, I would choose seven to nine
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.240]   p.m., eight to 10 p.m.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.200]   even because I'm single, because in New York people stay up later.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.960]   Now I'm in Austin, Texas, and people do things earlier.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.480]   So here it's more like five to seven p.m., six to eight.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.240]   What two hour time block would be good for you?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.760]   We have kids.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.880]   There's a whole question I have about how does this whole scenario change with
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.520]   children, because our kids eat dinner and go to bed.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Like, do you invite them?
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.680]   Let's talk about that right now.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.560]   So what time do your kids go to sleep?
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   We well, one is only a month.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.160]   So it's just kind of on demand whenever.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.120]   But but the two year old, we usually do dinner around six, six thirty, do bedtime
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.840]   routine, seven, seven thirty.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.440]   And from seven thirty on, she might not be asleep, but she's kind of in her room
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.240]   doing her own thing, hopefully falling asleep.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.040]   Great. So you have a one month old and you have a two month old, right?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.640]   Or sorry, a two year old.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.480]   Yeah, one month old and a two year old.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.280]   So five to seven could work.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.040]   We would just maybe need someone to help get her some food so that when the party
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.440]   wraps at seven, we'll go put her down.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.720]   Yes. So I love that idea for five to seven p.m.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.200]   And you're speaking a lot about what do you do?
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.520]   How do you have a party with kids?
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.280]   And the advice that I've gotten and I've worked and I've trained a lot of people
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.800]   to host their first party is they say that you have to have the child care
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.880]   handled, not just for your kids, but for any of the other people who you might
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.440]   invite to make it easy for them to say yes and to swing by.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.680]   And so to that extent, can you have child care that's available,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.640]   whether it's your au pair or hiring another babysitter as well?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.760]   Even if you have to spend an extra, I don't know how much babysitters cost.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.120]   Fifty hundred dollars.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.360]   Even if you had to spend a little bit extra to have one extra person
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.680]   that was on hand, the concept or the idea would be to have like a simultaneous
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.320]   children's party in your home, in another room separate from the adults.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.960]   How does that sound or how does that hit for you?
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   I think that can work.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.360]   We could ask around. It's in the summer.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.280]   There's a lot of kids in our neighborhood that are home from college.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.200]   We could probably find a couple of people to help entertain kids.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.440]   Or I'm less worried about that and more worried.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.520]   Are the parents going to want to let their kids go hang out with a random person?
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.600]   Are they going to want them to like hang out a second half of the backyard?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.680]   Yes. Maybe have the kids in the backyard
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.320]   where they're kind of in eyeshot, but doing their own thing.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.720]   So we could do that. Yes.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   Both of those things.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.800]   But just having the extra set of hands available during the party
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.200]   will let you figure out and feel the vibe.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.000]   Do you feel that your questions or concerns of managing the kids
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.640]   during the party are now handled doing it on a Wednesday night from five to 7 p.m.?
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.080]   We'll find out if anyone shows up or they're all like, no, I've got kids.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.120]   I can't do five to seven.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.200]   I think the biggest question is if everybody feeds their kids five to six o'clock.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   Yeah. How are the kids going to get fed?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   So you might not need parent food, but yes, kids might need food.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.280]   Well, I'm so glad that you mentioned that, because if one of your listeners
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.760]   is saying, why are they talking about kids so much?
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.720]   I don't have kids.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.560]   Well, the next step is going to apply both to you and to somebody without kids.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.240]   Now that you've picked your proposed date and time Wednesday from.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.120]   What time was it again from five to seven?
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.320]   OK, you're now going to think about what I call your core group.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.640]   Your core group will be your closest friends, neighbors
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   or colleagues who you would invite to this party.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.440]   And you need a minimum of five of them who would say yes.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.400]   So to get to five, you may need to invite eight to ten even.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.120]   So can you think or can you write down right now
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.560]   the names of five to ten of those people
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.680]   that you would invite first that would be part of what's called your core group?
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.240]   Yes, I don't think I'd have to write it down
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.880]   because we've done everything from baby showers to stuff like that.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.000]   So like, I think I have that list prepared somewhere,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.320]   but we don't have to go through it all right here.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.960]   Good. Well, you know who that is and you know how to message them.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.600]   Your next step is going to be to send them a text message, a DM,
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.200]   however you communicate most casually saying, hey, my wife and I are thinking
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:04.040]   about hosting a casual cocktail party on Wednesday night from five to 7 p.m.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.080]   Would that work for you?
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.320]   And if we do it, would you come?
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.640]   By getting those five first people to say, yes,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   that's what you're looking for is five yeses.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.880]   You've done a little bit of a survey to know that more or less
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.800]   this will work for them, and now your party is going to happen.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.600]   You're not going to make an event page.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.000]   You're not going to share it with anybody else until you get those five yeses.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.680]   And so since you've set your date out about four weeks,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.160]   you're going to give yourself the next one to three days
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.680]   to try to collect those five yeses.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.160]   If you cannot get the five yeses because people are saying,
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.680]   no way we can do that.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.320]   The kids are going to go down.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.200]   I can't work that with our schedule.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   Then you're going to modify based on your environmental situation.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.360]   You'll say, you know what?
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.160]   It's actually impossible for us to do this during the weeknight
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.240]   because the kids were going to rejigger this.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.040]   I know that Nick said on a Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.440]   let's actually try this on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.920]   OK, yeah, you can do that once you've done the first sample.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.240]   But once you get those five yeses, now your party is happening
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.840]   and it's off to the races.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.240]   Do you think that you would be able to get those five yeses?
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.640]   I think we can get five yeses, though.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.600]   When you said Sunday afternoon, my gears went, oh, man, Sunday afternoon
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.240]   feels like such a family friendly time after the nap, before dinner.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   You could do like four to six for the sake of this conversation.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.600]   I assume everything else will apply the same.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.880]   OK, good. So now you've gotten those five yeses.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.560]   Your next immediate step is to create an RSVP page
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.880]   to collect the confirmations from people.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.920]   What do we do by collecting the RSVPs?
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.680]   Have you used any of these like social platforms?
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.480]   Paperless Post, Evite, Eventbrite. Which one do you guys use?
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.720]   Or what have you used recently?
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.680]   I think we did Paperless Post for a baby shower,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.400]   but I'm very curious to know, like, what's your go to?
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.160]   Because Paperless Post, you can get lost in like, oh, which design do I want?
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.600]   And they charge you.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.560]   Somebody just told me that in order for you to download a CSV of the emails
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.080]   or something, they charge you, which is sneaky.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.200]   I understand. But sometimes for my friends, they're like,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   I'm not signing up for a subscription service.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.800]   The platform that I like the best, most that I recommend
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.240]   is a service called Mixily, M-I-X-I-L-Y.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:25.880]   The youth love a service called Partyful, P-A-R-T-I-F-U-L.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.800]   I like Mixily, and that is what I use.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.400]   I'm hosting a party tonight. It's the service that I use.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.720]   There's no charge. There is no fees. They don't spam your guests.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.160]   There's no ads. You don't need to download special software.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:45.120]   We're looking for the easiest way for someone to simply RSVP to your party.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.320]   And why do we do that?
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.840]   Because they make a social contract and they say, I'm going to show up.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.360]   And a lot of the work that I'm going to give you advice
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.240]   is just going to be making sure that people will attend.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.160]   And one of the ways we do that is by getting them to RSVP.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.120]   Not just saying, yes, they'll come on text, but to further their commitment by RSVP.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.920]   So all those five who have said yes, you're now going to text them back.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.960]   Perfect. Let me make an event page.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.560]   I'll follow up in a day or two.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.040]   You make the event page, you send them the link and you say,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.920]   will you please RSVP here just so we can get a head count?
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.240]   You will now have a landing page for your party
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.000]   that lists five or more people who are coming,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.480]   showing social proof to everybody else you invite
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.080]   that people are actually going to come to this party.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.680]   Have you ever been invited to an event?
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.920]   And you've clearly been spam the invitation.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.800]   It's 93 invited and two attending.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.520]   That's bad.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.200]   And we're never going to do that because we're always going to ask people,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.320]   can you come before you send the invitation?
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.960]   So you get your five yeses.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   You make the event page.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.000]   You get them all to sign up on RSVP.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.280]   Now you can invite a wider group that I call your great guests.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.600]   These are your acquaintances.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.200]   These are where you're going to fill up the rest of the guest list
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.840]   to get from 15 to 20 attendees, not including the kids.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.480]   I'll take a pause to see what type of questions you have or thoughts or feedback.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.000]   No, that makes sense.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.440]   I assume a guest, if you're inviting mostly couples, is each couple is two people.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.680]   If you're having 15 to 20, you're having eight to 10 couples.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.760]   Yes. If that's mostly the demographic.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.600]   Yes, yes, yes, that makes sense.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   It's so funny because when I would host my dinner parties,
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.800]   I would finally curate the guest list
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.720]   and I would try to invite all these entrepreneurs and other people.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.400]   And they'd ask, oh, can I bring my girlfriend?
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.840]   Can I bring so and so?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.960]   And I would say no, because I'm curating a specific group of people there.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.280]   And that is blasphemy.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.320]   If you tell somebody that they cannot bring their partner,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.480]   unless it's a very strictly business event, if it's a social event,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.920]   they can't bring your partner. It's very sketchy.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.720]   So I now no longer suggest that people limit their guest list.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.520]   And oftentimes for people hosting their first party, you just want warm bodies.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.840]   You just want as many people to say yes.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.360]   And so for your first party, I really need to encourage you, Chris.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.680]   Do not try to finally curate it.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.760]   Do not try to invite VIPs to this.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.160]   Simply invite people that you feel comfortable with
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.640]   to run through the pieces of this party formula that I'm going to share.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.680]   Great. So I've got this page set up.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.280]   What do I put on it?
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.920]   So the important thing about the page is you have to set the expectations
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.000]   of what is going to happen at this party.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.440]   And there's two unique things at one of my parties.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.400]   Number one, is there are name tags?
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.320]   And number two, there's icebreakers.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.680]   I can talk about why those are important, but I can tell you
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.880]   that by listing them in the invitation,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.400]   it will remove 95% of concerns that people that have on the event
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.680]   that they're going to sign up to an RSVP, by the way,
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.880]   you're also going to list not only the start time, but the end time.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.160]   Many people are like, how do I get people to leave my party?
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.240]   And by letting them know that there is an end time
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.000]   by clearly listing that, then it helps people to know.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.200]   And it also encourages them to show up on time, like we talked about.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.840]   So letting them know that there will be name tags and icebreakers.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.560]   I usually say something simple like.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.800]   Hey, I'm getting some friends together
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.280]   to have cocktails and a round of icebreakers.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.640]   There will be name tags because I'm bad with names, lol.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.440]   This is super casual.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.120]   You don't have to dress up.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.960]   You don't have to bring anything.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.320]   We'll have mixers, drinks, alcohol and seltzer.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.040]   And maybe you'll meet some new friends.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.720]   That's the general gist of what the invitation page will say.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.960]   And by giving people knowing what to expect,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.440]   it not only helps them have a successful event,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.200]   but it also encourages people that are kind of shy or like introverted.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.720]   Many times we don't think about those types of people.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.440]   You're a podcast host, so you're probably pretty outgoing.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.360]   I probably sound pretty extroverted and outgoing.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.240]   But a lot of my work in my book works to help people
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.520]   make their parties feel safe and comfortable for those
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   that might be a little socially awkward even after COVID too.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.240]   OK, so you didn't mention anything about food.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.880]   Is that because there's no food at this party?
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.120]   There's no food. There's only the most basic snacks.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.280]   If you had to think of a simple way to think about my parties,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.480]   you would think about the NIC party formula.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.160]   N-I-C-K. N stands for name tags.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.800]   I stands for icebreakers.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.240]   C stands for cocktails only, no food.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.680]   And K stands for kick them out at the end.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.760]   The party is only two hours.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.320]   Now, why is there no food?
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.600]   I have a pretty hard rule that there's no food,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.000]   because in the event that you say, well,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.400]   maybe we'll just do some past appetizers.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.120]   It completely changes the level of stress that's involved.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.480]   You can add food later on.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.680]   And in fact, my book goes through and I can just tell you what to have now.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.760]   You can have baby carrots.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.080]   You can have salted nuts.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.120]   You can have prepared easy food like snacks, chips, dip.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.720]   People love guacamole.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.760]   Those things are simple that take minimal preparation.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   But the whole purpose of this is to show you how easy
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.080]   hosting an event can be and that it's not about the food.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.680]   It's about the people.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.800]   OK, so no food.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.840]   Name tags make sense.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.880]   Kick them out makes sense, though.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.920]   I do want to know, what's the way to kick people out?
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.720]   Like, let's say it's five to seven.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.280]   It's seven rolls around.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.520]   Yeah, I'm guessing most people there aren't like, oh, looking at the time.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.960]   What do you say to people?
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.760]   So you as the host will make a last call
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.800]   about 15 minutes before the party is scheduled to end.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.920]   You would turn down the music and make a little announcement.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.360]   And so I'll say something like, all right, everybody, thank you so much for coming.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.640]   It's seven forty five.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.160]   I said this party would go till eight.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.320]   I know it's a school night, so I'm going to let you home.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.560]   Grab a last drink.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.960]   Say hello to somebody new if you hadn't had a chance yet.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.400]   And we'll start to wrap up in about 15 minutes.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.760]   And then I'll turn the music back up at the time the party is scheduled to end.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.520]   I will turn all the lights up.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.240]   I'll turn the music down.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   I'll thank everybody for coming.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.520]   Maybe I'll do a group photo.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.600]   I do something else that I hesitate to say
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.440]   because it'll make the party sound very weird, but at my parties,
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.840]   I do a little cheer.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.600]   I've had people have very success with doing this,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.560]   but it does feel like a kid's summer camp.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.480]   But it adds a finality or sort of an end to it.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.360]   And as silly and ridiculous as my formula sounds,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.080]   I promise you that it really does work.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.680]   I love it. OK, OK.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.760]   I have a couple of fobs.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.840]   You said music is there like a go to playlist.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.520]   I feel like that could be a stressful thing for a lot of people.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.880]   Try to curate what's playing.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.680]   Oh, my gosh. Never, never try to preprogram a playlist.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.200]   You want easy, happy music that is not too loud.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.320]   I will play the Beach Boys channel on a streaming service.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.320]   It's easy. It's non-controversial.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.520]   It's upbeat. It's generally positive.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.360]   I'm looking for stuff like that.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.680]   I have collected a list of playlists,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.520]   www.party.pro/playlists of party playlists
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.160]   that my friends and readers and other hosts have used.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.000]   But generally, you just want something very easy.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.720]   That's background music that's upbeat and happy.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.160]   I feel like I've nailed most of these follow ups, but.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.240]   Cocktails, you brushed over quickly.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.720]   Yeah, it can be a lot of work to make a mixed drink.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.960]   Is this really just like only cocktails or is this beer, wine?
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.200]   And if you want a cocktail, you can make it a first controversial thing.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.880]   There's no beer.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.320]   And I'll tell you why there's no beer.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.560]   Second thing, I wrote a book called The Two Hour Cocktail Party,
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.240]   and I don't even drink alcohol.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.440]   So that's ironic.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.120]   There's not a single mixed drink recipe that's in the book.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:53.080]   But we use that phrase cocktail party because it encapsulates
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.120]   a social construct of an easy event that is lightweight
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.840]   and acceptable to pop into.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.240]   When I say the phrase cocktail party, what do you think of?
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.400]   What sort of comes to mind to you, Chris?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   I said in the intro, it feels very like, you know, walk in,
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.920]   grab a martini kind of thing.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.520]   When it comes out of your mouth, it obviously doesn't feel that way.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.120]   It feels a bit more casual.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.240]   Well, the reality is, is what drinks are you going to have at your party?
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.000]   You're going to have a do it yourself, serve yourself bar.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.480]   And so that can be a couple bottles of alcohol.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.560]   You can have vodka or tequila or whiskey or bourbon or whatever.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.200]   You're going to have some basic mixers.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.920]   You'll have a bowl filled with ice.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.840]   You'll have maybe some juice and plenty of non-alcoholic options
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.480]   like seltzer, seltzer water or hard seltzer.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.320]   Now, I do not include beer for my list.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.880]   Are you a beer drinker?
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.400]   I'm a casual beer drinker.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.440]   Like, I enjoy beer, but I wouldn't say it's always my go to.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.160]   Do you have friends that are beer drinkers that are beer drinkers?
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.120]   Yeah, I would be shocked if anyone ever says no to that question.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:00.040]   So generally, what I find with beer drinkers is that they are highly brand loyal.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.280]   Beer drinkers are very specific in their beer preferences.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.960]   They're highly brand loyal.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.480]   And beer just creates a lot of party shrapnel.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.640]   I mean, like there's extra beer bottles, there's beer cans.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.680]   It's just like all this extra stuff.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.560]   What type of beer?
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.480]   Well, if I'm going to buy this beer, then you need another type of beer for somebody else.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.200]   If you want to serve beer at your party, you absolutely can.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.880]   But I want to tell all your listeners I've hosted hundreds of parties
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.200]   never serving beer, and it's just another thing to remove the stress for me.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.760]   And I've never had a complaint.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.040]   So there's all these little hacks that I'm doing,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.760]   which is just trying to make it as easy as possible to teach you
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.400]   that you can host and you can make hosting easy.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.160]   And then it can absolutely change your life if you become someone who hosts.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.600]   OK, so I've got the drinks that you didn't mention wine.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.400]   Is there wine there?
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.720]   Wine, some white wine, some red wine in the summertime, a rosé.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.040]   Just get two bottles of each. OK.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.880]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.240]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.880]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.160]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.520]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.320]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.120]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.000]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.440]   you're wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.240]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.000]   And it's not just for men.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.680]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.320]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.040]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.080]   I've ever owned.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.880]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.160]   whether it's running, training or yoga.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.840]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.400]   or their meta pants can even work for a night out.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.760]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.960]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   your first purchase, as well as free shipping and returns on U.S.

[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:12.160]   Again, go to all the hacks dot com slash V U O R I
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.480]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.280]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.080]   I get it.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.800]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.600]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.640]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.600]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.040]   the go to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.120]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.200]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.360]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.840]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.520]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do list,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.400]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.640]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   on their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.960]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.240]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.600]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly dot com.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.520]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.880]   Must be 21 plus not available in all locations.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.160]   That hit everything except this looming topic of icebreakers,
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.800]   and I think anyone listening right now is kind of wondering, oh, gosh,
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.680]   what does Nick mean when he says icebreakers?
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.200]   Yeah. And why do icebreakers?
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.640]   Aren't those silly? Aren't those childish?
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.760]   Well, we do icebreakers because it's a short survey of the room.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.280]   And icebreakers also not only give your guests excuses to go meet new people,
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.440]   which, by the way, that's why your party is going to be very successful.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.120]   And that's why your friends will love you for hosting this,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.240]   because you are going to help them meet new people.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.680]   Most adults haven't made a new friend in the last three years.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.320]   And yet, as we get older, we need friends more than ever, right?
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.480]   Friends become like a game of attrition.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.520]   They have kids. They move. Things happen.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.400]   We don't see people as often.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   Your party will be successful because all of your guests
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.520]   are going to talk to a lot of new people.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.920]   How do we encourage that?
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.840]   By using these icebreakers.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.960]   Icebreakers are a short survey of the room.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.760]   Generally, you'll go around the circle.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.880]   You say your name, you'll say what you do for work.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.680]   If you don't want to say for work, you say something you're excited about.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.440]   And then the third one, which is the icebreaker question.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.280]   OK, so each icebreaker has three parts name, what you do for work,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.600]   and then the icebreaker question, right?
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.640]   You'll do three rounds of icebreakers.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.960]   I think of icebreakers as a green, yellow, red scaffolding
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.840]   where you would want to start your party with a green level icebreaker.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.000]   A green level icebreaker.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.120]   The one that I use that I suggest everybody use for the first one
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.600]   is what is one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast?
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.560]   So first, how does that hit with you?
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.240]   What are your thoughts?
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.880]   I'm ready for it.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.400]   If you hate it, then tell me and I'll tell you why it's great.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.200]   But I just want to hear your thoughts.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.920]   I don't actually eat breakfast that often.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.160]   So because because why not?
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.520]   Why don't you choose to eat breakfast?
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.640]   I don't know.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.400]   You just skip. It's not for health reasons.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   You're not intermittent fasting.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.840]   You just I'm just lazy.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.000]   I have just I forget.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.800]   Sometimes it's been intermittent fasting.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.160]   Sometimes it's just one more thing to think about during the day.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.000]   Now, when you do eat breakfast,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.120]   what's one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast when you do?
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.200]   I mean, I do eat breakfast.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.080]   It's usually some ridiculous make an amazing breakfast
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.960]   for the weekend kind of thing, like lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.160]   Are you lemon ricotta pancakes?
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.880]   Are you kidding me?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.960]   That's like a go to once a month kind of thing in our house.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.120]   I've asked this icebreaker hundreds of times.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.680]   I've never heard somebody say lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.280]   That's incredible.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.080]   So I think it's like I don't make a lot of breakfast.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.680]   So if I do make breakfast, yeah, I'm going to step it up.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.200]   And I have this recipe.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.120]   Now I feel like I should put in the show notes that I think is just like
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.840]   every time I make these lemon ricotta pancakes and they're not that hard.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.640]   It just wins every time.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.160]   Wait, now I got to know how long does it take you to make?
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.120]   OK, look, if we're doing this at my party, I just want to show you right there
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.200]   what just happened.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.640]   You expressed a piece of your personality that you share
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.600]   and you make your secret thing, lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.480]   Now, you might not always eat breakfast,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.320]   but you did get to share when you do make breakfast what you make, OK?
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.920]   Everybody chooses or not chooses to eat breakfast every single day.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.280]   And it is generally a positive, happy feeling that we have.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.360]   A good green level icebreaker is an icebreaker that's quick to answer.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.640]   It's fast and it doesn't incur judgment from others.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.880]   A bad green icebreaker, which I would never do, would be something like,
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.880]   say your name, so what you do for work and say your favorite book ever.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.120]   OK, because that's subjective.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.880]   That's definitive.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.840]   That's very hard to pick.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.040]   It's going to maybe elicit a little bit of judgment.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.240]   People are going to try to show off.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.600]   They don't know.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.840]   Now, how do we modify that? Right.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.400]   It's what I said.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.720]   What's one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast?
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.080]   I still wouldn't ask.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.640]   What's one of your favorite books?
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.680]   I would ask that later because a book is an intellectual thing, right?
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.240]   Breakfast is a human delicious thing.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.440]   It's a fun thing.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.160]   It's an easy thing.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.320]   So we ask that as just a way for everybody at your party
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.960]   to sort of sound off and express a piece of their personality.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.520]   You do it very quick.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   A good icebreaker is a quick icebreaker.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.680]   So you're not going to allow for follow up questions
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.320]   like I was drilling you on, right?
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.400]   You're just going to have everybody go around.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.200]   And then you just say, all right, thanks, everybody.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.800]   I do those icebreakers so we can all meet somebody new.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.480]   Maybe I hope you'll say hello.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.960]   And then you as a host shut up and you just let the party go,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.120]   which is so awkward as a new host.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.360]   If you've never done this, you're like, this is terrifying.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.400]   But then you do it and the room explodes.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.120]   It comes alive.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.040]   People go up and they talk to new people.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.520]   You turn the music back up and everybody's making these conversations.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.480]   So we do that because most parties you go to, you just what?
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.600]   Like you went to your kid's birthday party recently.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.840]   They didn't do icebreakers.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.040]   Maybe you bumped into somebody and started the conversation.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.160]   I'm guessing. Right.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.240]   It's just physical prowess.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.120]   Like don't let your kid drink that juice box
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.760]   because my daughter just threw it on the ground like that was our icebreakers.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.520]   Yes, yes. And there's nothing wrong with those.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.600]   Those are fine gatherings.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.680]   But for listeners of your show, they're interested in how to get more out of life.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.720]   They're interested in optimizing things.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:49.200]   And as cliche and as ridiculous as it sounds to optimize your social situations,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.880]   it does help if the goal is to help your friends make more friends,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.760]   to do a survey of the room, do a couple of them during your party
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.160]   to give people excuses to go start a new conversation.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.280]   Because, by the way, the other reason we do icebreakers
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.080]   is it gives people an easy excuse to end their conversations.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.840]   So are you doing these like every 30 minutes you pop into an icebreaker
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.800]   and then turn it off?
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.720]   That's exactly right. You do them every 30 minutes.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.280]   You're going to do them three times, two or three times.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.600]   And they should only take five or so minutes.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.880]   By the way, a hack that everybody needs to know the icebreakers.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.520]   You have to be standing.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.480]   You cannot let people sit down.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.080]   It is the kryptonite to a successful.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.880]   You can't do icebreakers sitting down.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.240]   People ask follow up questions.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.200]   They'll drone on a good icebreakers, a fast one.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.520]   OK, you said you go from green to yellow to red.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.000]   What are the more advanced ones?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.800]   And because people are coming going, do you redo the names
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.840]   and the works each time?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.240]   Yes. You redo the names.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.600]   You do that for all of them.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.280]   So your first icebreaker, I'll give them the details with you.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.560]   Your first icebreaker.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.400]   You're going to do when there's only five or six people who've shown up.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:02.520]   And that is what I call lovingly the awkward zone at a party.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.280]   It's the first 10 or 20 minutes when not many people are there.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.480]   It's a little bit awkward.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.760]   There's not enough energy in the room.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.880]   You do the icebreaker to bust out of the awkward zone.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.800]   You're going to do that same icebreaker about 20 minutes later
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.720]   when now everybody has arrived.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.000]   And then 30 minutes later, you'll do your last and final icebreaker.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.480]   And what I like to ask is, say your name, say what you do for work,
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.960]   and then say one of the favorite pieces of media
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.320]   that you've consumed over the last couple of months.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.600]   That could be a show on Netflix.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.120]   It could be a podcast like this.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.240]   It could be a great book that you read, a long form article,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.680]   a funny meme that you saw, a TikTok video, just a cool piece of media
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.200]   that you consumed and enjoyed.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.680]   And Chris, this one works so well because everybody's sharing
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.720]   great recommendations for a book, a movie, something.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.800]   And people are wanting to write down stuff.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   They're feeling smarter because everybody's sharing these great ideas.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.240]   So I love that one.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.720]   OK, what about that middle break?
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.640]   Any other tips for icebreakers beyond the two you shared?
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.720]   One more that you could do.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.920]   And this is you've probably seen this online used for engagement bait.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.000]   What is one of your favorite purchases of the last year?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.680]   It could be a service or an activity, or it could be a physical object
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.520]   that you've purchased.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.400]   Maybe it's a new car.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.120]   Maybe it's a kitchen appliance.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.160]   But what's one of your favorite purchases
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.720]   that's made your life better during the last year?
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.520]   And people love to show.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.800]   I love this one. Yeah, that's good.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   OK, there's one more thing I tell you about this.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.200]   OK. Reminder messages.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.160]   You need to do three reminder messages leading up to your party
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.320]   to keep it top of mind.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.800]   And you'll send those reminder messages, one of them
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.240]   one week before the party. Simple message.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   Hey, everybody, what's up? Excited to have you guys over.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.160]   We'll see you next week on Wednesday night at 5 p.m.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.840]   More details to come.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.680]   OK, the next one you'll send is three days before your party.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.480]   And for that one, you're going to use something I call guest bios
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.520]   and guest bios you're going to do for half or more of your attendees.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.200]   It's a brief blurb about your guests.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.400]   So for me, it could be Nick Gray recently moved to Austin, Texas.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.320]   He lived in New York for 13 years.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.880]   Ask him about green tea. Right.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.360]   It's a quick little blurb or summary
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.120]   that you could pull from their LinkedIn or their Instagram
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.520]   or something like that.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.240]   And it doesn't have to be 100% right.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.840]   You're not asking for permission from other people to get this right.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.680]   You're just writing some stuff to give these conversational access points
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:41.120]   and also to get them locked into attending and to give those sort of introverts
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.960]   or shy people an idea of who's going to be there,
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.800]   an idea of who they might want to talk to and to raise the excitement
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.000]   of all the other people as well.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.040]   But not everyone. Just a few people.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.240]   You don't have to do it, everyone.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.680]   What I suggest is half or more.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.120]   I'm more focused on the minimum. Don't do any less than half.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.720]   So if you have 16 people coming, you need to do the minimum of eight.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.520]   But don't feel that you have to do every single person.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.160]   I generally feel more is better, but don't feel like it has to be work.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.840]   You're not going to spend an hour writing this thing.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.520]   It's just a quick little blurb.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.640]   OK, so I think I got it handled.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.480]   I think I'm ready to go. Good.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.680]   Any follow up after?
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.560]   Do you try to get feedback on how it went?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.360]   Yes. So right before you do your third round of icebreakers,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.840]   you are going to do a group photo, right?
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.400]   A quick selfie. What's up, everybody?
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.000]   Turn around and take a selfie real quick.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.640]   OK, group photo.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.880]   The next morning you will send them a thank you message.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.560]   Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.200]   You include everybody on BCC.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.480]   Thank you guys all for coming.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.120]   Can I invite you next time? Right.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.840]   Simple question.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.240]   It's easy for them to say yes to.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.480]   And you attach the group photo. That's it.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.640]   That's all that you do. Yes, you can do surveys.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.520]   That's an advanced level move.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.520]   I don't recommend it yet.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.160]   But yes, surveys are helpful as you start to host more.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.560]   Any other advanced moves for people who are hearing this?
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.520]   And they're like, no, no, I'm ready for them now.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.280]   Oh, gosh, I hesitate to say this.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.080]   But yes, I will tell your listeners, but please don't do this first.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.960]   Please do not do this first.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.280]   OK. A popular theme that you can do.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.640]   I'm trying to teach and I wrote this book and all this stuff that I'm sharing
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   because this is an operating system to run events.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.120]   You can use it at kids birthday parties.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.720]   You can use it at a lot of different type of events.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.640]   For your first one, just do a cocktail party.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.920]   Don't try to get fancy.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.160]   The one that is an absolute banger.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.280]   Huge success is for your neighbors and friends to do a book swap.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.960]   Everybody likes books.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.120]   Everybody has extra books they want to get rid of.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.760]   Everybody likes to get new books.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.080]   A book swap is so easy.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.560]   You use the same exact formula name what you do for work,
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.720]   but maybe instead of something else, you'd say,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.960]   and tell us about one of the books that you brought. Right.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.760]   Why is it a great book?
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.880]   This book swap thing, I'm telling you, I've had people do it
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   and it's their most well attended event. So that's a good one.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.600]   You can host a clothing swap.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.880]   I have a formula for hosting a clothing swap.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.760]   All of these things that you can do, you can do more thematic ones if you want.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.160]   But those are sort of advanced level.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.200]   Get the formula first.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.600]   Most people have never run an icebreaker before.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.320]   Can I tell you about how to run a good icebreaker? Yeah.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.120]   So here's a key thing.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.800]   A lot of people don't like icebreakers because the host, all right,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.240]   we're going to do an icebreaker.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.480]   Say your name and what you do and the worst first date you ever went on.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.320]   Chris, you go first. Right.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.560]   It's like terrible. It's so bad.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.320]   It's a good example of a red level question
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.200]   where there's not enough rapport built up among people yet.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.920]   So we wouldn't do that one.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.800]   But a good icebreaker always has the host go first.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:53.000]   Ask permission for who can go next and then indicate to the group
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.360]   which way the round of icebreakers would go.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.880]   So as an example, if I was setting up the icebreaker, I would say.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   All right, so now we're going to do this round of icebreakers.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.000]   You're going to say your name, what you do for work
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.440]   and one of your favorite things for breakfast.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.640]   I will go first and then looking to my left.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.880]   Chris, can we go to you next?
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.520]   And hopefully you'll say yes. I'll say great.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.720]   So I will go first.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.880]   We'll go to Chris next.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.520]   And then we're going to go around the circle this way.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.120]   It sounds childish.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.400]   It sounds like I'm a clown telling multiple times
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.040]   the instructions and which way to go around.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.680]   But it just makes the instructions crystal clear.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.120]   It makes it run fast and it gives power to those.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.680]   I don't know those people with social anxiety.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.480]   I dated a woman who had a lot of social anxiety.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.080]   And she said the more that I could know
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.960]   which way it was going, the less surprises, the better.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.360]   I love it.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.000]   Unfortunately, you are coming to San Francisco soon, but not later.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.080]   So you won't get to see me do this in action.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.280]   But I will let you know how it goes.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.480]   And we'll maybe save some of those advanced tactics for later.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.640]   I'm going to give one last thing.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.720]   When you do your round icebreakers, I want your wife to stand next to you.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.120]   And I want her to talk too much
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.200]   so that you can actually kind of cut her off.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.160]   Why do you want to do that?
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.480]   Because then you can signal to everybody else
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.160]   that we're not going to use these icebreakers to drone on and on and talk too long.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.760]   You can cut her off first.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.680]   People will laugh a little bit.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.600]   And I think that'll help.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   Or she can go first and cut me off.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.280]   She could go first, but then she needs to facilitate it
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.520]   and she needs to be the one who is the facilitator.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.000]   So, yes, absolutely.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.080]   There's nothing worse than doing icebreakers and one person talks forever.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.080]   So, yes, I'm a big fan of finding a way to politely show people
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.600]   that this is not a time to give a presentation.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yes, yes. And sometimes we have to do that.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.760]   We have to lead a party with generous authority.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.120]   And that means that what is best for the whole group
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.240]   is not always being ultra polite to one person.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.840]   So with a successful cocktail party, what do you hope people feel after it?
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.880]   And what kind of comes out of this whole experience?
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.760]   A successful cocktail party has the energy in the room very high.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.480]   And somebody leaves your party saying, wow, that was like the best party.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.240]   That was awesome.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.280]   And it's so simple.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.240]   I got a message from a woman who just read my book
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.920]   and she hosted a party with name tags and icebreakers.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.080]   And she said that night she and her husband got multiple text messages
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.400]   from friends saying that it was the best party that they'd ever thrown.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.840]   Why? Because they just added a little structure to it.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.480]   So what's the feeling?
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.880]   It's that feeling that when you're done hosting, you say that was awesome.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.760]   And that was also easy.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.160]   Like I could do that again, because I think we've all hosted parties
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.360]   where we're absolutely drained afterwards.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.480]   And while it may have been a success, we never want to do it again.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.000]   What's the energy that your guests have?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.320]   It's that they met so many people.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.680]   They had a really great time.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.000]   You let them go early, right?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.120]   They didn't feel like they had to.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.240]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   We have to see that.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.760]   No, you're telling them they got to go get out of here.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.040]   You're ending it while it's going great.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.960]   I want to turn to talk about this business.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.440]   You started Museum Hack.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.200]   And my understanding is you started a little accidentally
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.280]   and you became a lover of museums, not intentionally.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.240]   And you probably started on the other end of the spectrum.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.080]   How did this all come about?
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.800]   Yeah, I hate most museums.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.440]   I think they're really boring
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.720]   and they just don't have anything to do with me.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.000]   I didn't grow up going to museums.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.760]   I think they're stupid.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.400]   However, I lived in New York City where they had the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.720]   And it's a big museum.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.920]   Have you been to the Met?
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.880]   I haven't.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.720]   OK, it's enormous.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.560]   It's the most popular museum in America.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.600]   It's 2.3 million square feet.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.000]   It takes up 11 acres of Central Park.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.240]   It's enormous and it's overwhelming.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.880]   And for many New Yorkers, it's just a tourist attraction.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.800]   It's not a place they have a relationship with.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.120]   This woman brought me there on a romantic date and she showed me things.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.560]   And she talked to me at my level, which I have like a third grade reading level.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.360]   And so she just sort of talked to me like, wow, look at these
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.400]   Egyptian artifacts, sculpture, furniture, paintings.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.080]   And so I started to go back to the museum because I was like,
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.000]   I think I moved in New York to hang out at places like this.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.440]   And so I'd go to the museum and just explore.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.840]   I'd look things up on Wikipedia.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.520]   I'd watch YouTube videos.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.000]   And I started to do these tours for my friends,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.920]   just showing them around when they'd come visit.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.360]   And they became like a famous thing because my tours were basically
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.800]   10 cool things I found and three things I wanted to steal.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.720]   Not like a narrative arc of art history, just cool stuff I found.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:27.040]   And then it became very famous and celebrities started to come.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.760]   And I hired some tour guides to lead the tours.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:34.520]   And what was special was Museum Hack would hire Broadway actors
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.160]   and stand up comedians to be the tour guides instead of the museum volunteers.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.120]   And they would work for me, not for the museum.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.960]   And so they would tell the juicy backstories about the art,
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.680]   about how much the art cost, about stories of the donors,
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.960]   things like that, that people wanted to hear.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.040]   And so that was our whole thing was attracting new audiences
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.800]   into these storied museums.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.120]   Obviously, people can go take a Museum Hack tour,
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.920]   which is still running as a business.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.960]   But if someone asked me the question, how do you do a museum?
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.680]   I don't feel like I would have the answer.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.920]   You would. And I feel like you have a better answer.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.400]   Yeah, I'll tell your listeners exactly how to visit a museum.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.800]   And they're in San Francisco. Have you been to the Legion of Honor?
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.920]   I have. Yeah, it's a nice museum, right?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.800]   That one and the DeYoung are two really nice museums there.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.960]   So here's how to visit.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.760]   Here's exactly from all my time.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.480]   And I've been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art more than a thousand times.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.640]   And I've been to many other museums.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:33.120]   Here is how you should go about experiencing a museum for the first time.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.560]   So you're going to a new museum, any museum, or is it, you know,
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.120]   specific categories work better than others for this?
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   This applies to any museum.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.160]   Museum Hack, in my opinion, works best for art museums.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.680]   But the thing, the hack, the special sauce I'm about to tell you,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.640]   the way to approach works for any museum.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.440]   And here's what you're going to do.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.200]   As soon as you get there, you're going to go in right where you buy your ticket.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:02.760]   You'll get a map and you are going to walk the entire floor plan
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.520]   and you're not going to stop.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.720]   You're not going to stop and look at it.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.720]   I don't care if you love it. You're not going to stop.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.800]   You can circle it on the map and you'll come back later.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.880]   But you're not going to stop.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.520]   You're going to walk the entire floor plan
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:22.640]   to build a mental map of the space and to know where you want to go back to later.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.600]   So first, you'll walk the entire floor plan.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.720]   It could take you between five and 45 minutes, depending how big it is.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.080]   You will then go to the museum cafe.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.560]   Almost all museums have a cafe.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.720]   If they don't have a cafe, you can just sit down
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.520]   and you're going to take a little break.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.280]   I like to go there and I like to get a cup of coffee.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.520]   You can get a glass of wine if you want and you get a little snack.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.720]   You're going to replenish your glycogen or your glucose or whatever.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.600]   You're just going to have some carbs, maybe some sugar to build up
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   your energy store to go back now that you've seen everything briefly.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.320]   You will now go back and look closer at the things that captured
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.440]   your mind and interest.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.680]   What happens to many people, why we do this is have you ever done this?
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:11.080]   You go to a new museum and you waste all of your cognitive load
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.000]   and looking energy on things that you don't even want to look at
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.240]   because the best stuff sometimes is at the very end.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.520]   The stuff that you're most excited about.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   And by the time you get to that stuff, you're tired and you're exhausted.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   So the way to do it is to walk through the entire floor plan.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.680]   Do not stop at anything.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.760]   Circle things on the map, go to the cafe, take a break
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.240]   and then go back and look closer and deeper at the things you're curious about.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.040]   And how long would you tell someone to budget for a trip to a museum?
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.600]   I personally can't spend more than two hours.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.840]   I think that this is one of the biggest things that I changed.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.560]   A lot of my friends thinking about is that you don't have to go
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.000]   try to get every single dollar's worth and stay there as long as possible.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.160]   I can spend about two hours at a museum before I get tired.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.720]   This is a real thing.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.160]   Getting tired at a museum, it's called gallery fatigue.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.080]   It happens because we're not in an activated space.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.560]   We're quiet. We're thinking we don't know how we're supposed to act.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.440]   It can be stressful sometimes.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.480]   So I spend about two hours total.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   OK, so about half that time is a run through and a cafe.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.160]   And then the other half is actually spending time in the things you're interested in.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.120]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.200]   Sometimes if I go to a museum for two hours, I'll spend an hour in the cafe
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.280]   because I just want to go approach it with a strategy.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.160]   And many times we don't have a strategy
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.320]   when we go into a new physical space like a museum.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.080]   We're just walking where our body takes us and we're looking.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.360]   And before we know it, we've wasted an hour and we're tired
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.720]   and we didn't even get to go see the really cool stuff
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.160]   that's on the second floor back in the modern way.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.760]   And could you do that from the map at home or do you need to be there?
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.880]   I think you need to be there because you need to walk it.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.120]   You need to physically get in your body and see the stuff firsthand.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.000]   For example, I love that the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.480]   there's this beautiful green sofa.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.200]   It's not going to be on any of the museum website or featured top galleries.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.760]   I don't know why I like it, but it was owned by the King of Spain or something.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.160]   And I love that thing.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.680]   And you're not going to find that when you do the museum's website
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.520]   tour of the galleries.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.880]   Do you have some favorite museums?
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.320]   If you've been to the Met a thousand times, I imagine when you're in a new city,
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.640]   how could you help yourself from going to check out a new museum?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.680]   Yeah, I love to go to new museums.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.400]   So the Metropolitan Museum of Art is my favorite in the whole world.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.200]   And it's what's called an encyclopedic museum.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.360]   That means there's many different galleries and curatorial departments.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.800]   So I love encyclopedic museums, maybe similar to the Legion of Honor
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.440]   there in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.920]   I like the National Gallery.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.760]   I like the enormous big museums
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.360]   because they have a little something for everyone.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.360]   And using my strategy maybe will help your visitors
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.160]   approach these really big museums that can be so intimidating
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.240]   to feel like you don't have to get it all in at once.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.360]   It's OK to leave and not see everything.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.800]   What about deals on going to museums?
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.760]   I feel like running Museum Hack while the whole brand
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.240]   wasn't getting a deal on getting into museums, what have you found in that space?
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.360]   For deals, I could tell you how to beat the line
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.480]   so I can tell people how to skip the line.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.480]   Deals, it's really. Oh, yes. Oh, my God.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.120]   Wait, I completely forgot I have the best deal ever.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.920]   I've won. Oh, my God.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.720]   I have the best.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.320]   I hope I'm not blowing out my mic levels being too loud.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.000]   I have the best hack ever.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.760]   And don't put this in the show notes.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.600]   There is a membership called the American Alliance of Museums.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.120]   It's essentially an industry trade group for museums in America.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.200]   You can join as a non-employee.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.680]   It's called a friend of the association or something.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.640]   It's called AAM, American Alliance of Museums.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   You can join as a friend of the association for under $100 per year.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.200]   It will grant you access, a free ticket
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.440]   to almost every single museum in America.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.120]   Wow. Do not blow up my spot.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.160]   Don't blow up my spot.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.880]   American Alliance of Museums.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.960]   It's like the friend membership or something.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.720]   It should be $100 or less.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.160]   And me and my friends have done this for many years.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.040]   Now, you should also support if you're listening to museums.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.200]   I'm not trying to scam people out of how to pay
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.000]   for these culture institutions that largely are underfunded.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.480]   I want to tell you about this, though, so that you feel like
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.400]   you can go to a museum for an hour and fall in love with it.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.680]   And you can go multiple times.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.360]   You can buy this and go to the Legion of Honor for 45 minutes.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.240]   And hopefully you'll fall in love with it and buy a membership
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.920]   and support it in other ways.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.320]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:52.680]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.880]   deals and discounts from our partners.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.120]   You can go to all the hacks dot com slash deals.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.520]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.000]   What about skipping the lines?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.480]   You said there was another thing for skipping the lines.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:10.680]   Yes. So for skipping the lines, some museums have additional entrances.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.120]   Major museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.720]   will have an education entrance that's for school groups and other things.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.960]   At the Metropolitan Museum in New York City, there is almost always
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:27.880]   an enormous line out the main entrance, but no line at the education entrance.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.200]   Doesn't mean you have to be part of a school group to use that entrance.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.760]   You can just go in and buy a ticket like normal.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.000]   That's another hack.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.560]   Love it. The one hack I want to share.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.200]   It's not for everyone, literally, because it's a Capital One related deal right now.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.640]   But I mentioned this in the last episode, but since this is all about museums,
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.400]   if you have a Capital One card, I think for almost the next year,
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.960]   it's until June 2024, I think you can with any Capital One membership
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.240]   get a six month membership to this site called the Cultivist,
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.760]   which gives you and three guests access to 100 museums around the world.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.800]   I know it includes the Louvre, the Guggenheim, the MoMA and a lot more.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.720]   After that six months, you have to pay $40 a month if you like it
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.000]   and you want to keep going. Great.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   But there is a six month free membership that I'd recommend
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   anyone with a Capital One card check out.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.760]   And I'll put that in the show notes as well.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.640]   Great one.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.840]   And then the other one, most museum memberships are all tax
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.600]   deductible donations. Yes.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.800]   Most museum tickets are not.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.600]   So if you ever see that thing where it's like, buy your ticket,
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   you can apply the cost of your ticket to your membership.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.640]   Technically, the ticket price is not a deductible contribution,
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.200]   but the incremental cost is.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.320]   So if you're going to join, join before you buy the tickets.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.720]   But we looked into it.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:48.360]   And after you factor in the deduction you get for making a contribution,
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.040]   it was cheaper for us to buy a one year membership to the Academy of Sciences,
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.760]   which allowed us a certain number of guests
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.960]   than it was to actually just buy the tickets the day of. Yes.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:01.720]   So in many cases, that's true, which has now resulted in us
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.880]   being members of the Oakland Zoo, the Academy of Sciences,
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.280]   a place called Curiosity on the peninsula,
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.000]   which is kind of like half kid science museum, half zoo.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.040]   So I feel like we're collecting memberships because it turns out
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.960]   that factoring in the cost, it actually ends up being about the same cost
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:22.280]   as going sometimes once, sometimes twice, but almost never more than two times.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.920]   It's really not that expensive.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.760]   You're exactly right to join at the lowest level for many of these institutions
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.280]   with unlimited membership.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.360]   I'll tell you something else for your listeners, a hack
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.600]   for many of these organizations, the biggest ones I'm talking about
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.400]   in major cities, New York, Chicago, D.C.,
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.440]   Seattle, Denver, big, big cities.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.040]   Their art museums and sometimes science museums
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.480]   will have something called a young members program,
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   young patrons program, something like that,
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.920]   that typically goes after members 45 or 40 and younger.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.720]   And gives you extremely VIP access
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.920]   at a disturbingly discount rate.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.200]   I'll give you an example in New York City at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.360]   There was something called the Apollo Circle Group
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.440]   that was a thousand dollars a year.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.960]   Now you might think, wow, that is expensive.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.280]   It is expensive for some people that gave you once a month
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.720]   after hours parties at the museum
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:31.520]   with incredible past appetizers, open bar, private tours from the curators.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.280]   Insane level of access that for older members,
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.440]   they were charging five, 10, 15, 20 thousand dollars a year.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.640]   But they subsidize this for young people, hoping that you will develop
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.080]   a long term relationship and donate a lot more.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.320]   So young patrons programs at these museums.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.080]   The key word would be to ask if you're looking to buy a membership
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.480]   and you're curious about this, say, oh, what type of young patrons
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.040]   memberships might you have?
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.960]   And I forgot about Bank of America.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:04.320]   If you have a Bank of America card, I think the first weekend of every month,
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.600]   you can go to a ton of museums around the country for free.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.640]   Yes, I know.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.760]   In San Francisco, it includes the Legion of Honor in the DeYoung Museum.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.280]   Even like a free Bank of America checking account would, I think, qualify.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.000]   If I remember correctly, that's another one.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.120]   I'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.200]   With Museum Hack, you probably talk to lots of people and learn a lot about
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.320]   planning tours, booking tours.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.800]   What do you do if you're in a new country and you want to find a tour?
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.080]   Do you have a way to do that that cuts through the noise and finds the best tours?
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:38.160]   I'll tell you right now, the people that are killing it are Airbnb experiences.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.680]   Have you done an Airbnb experience?
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.720]   We've done a bunch of virtual ones that were kind of company
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.040]   organized events during COVID.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:46.560]   No way.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:49.720]   You got to do the real in-person Airbnb experience.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.240]   And I would even challenge you
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.000]   to set up a date night with your wife and do one of them in San Francisco
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.680]   on the Airbnb experiences.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.640]   The problem is now they're spamming them a lot with these photo things
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.680]   where they're just trying to juice for photos.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.040]   Skip all of those.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.600]   I'm looking for food tours and walking tours
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.480]   that have an average rating above 4.9 with at least 25 reviews.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.680]   Generally, you're going to get some really good tour guides.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.560]   And what I like about that is they're empowered tour guides
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.560]   that have set up their own businesses that are going to be very passionate.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.240]   So I like Airbnb experiences, and I will generally schedule it.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.720]   The first thing I do to a city, because then I can ask the guide for advice.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.800]   Awesome.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.480]   This show isn't usually a show about someone's story,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.360]   their resume and that kind of stuff.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.600]   But I looked and I was like, "Oh, you sold your company. Cool."
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.240]   You know, a lot of shows would be like, "Tell me about that."
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.200]   I wasn't that interested for the purpose of this show.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.400]   And then I saw that it was actually a very interesting way you sold your company.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.760]   Something that I think most people probably as business owners
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.600]   wouldn't think of and most people as employees wouldn't think of.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.120]   And so I would love to just hear the quick version of that
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.440]   and how it's gone, because I thought it was something that at least
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.640]   one person listening might get a lot out of hearing.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:09.680]   Yes, I sold my last company, Museum Hack, to my then CEO and marketing director.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   They came to me with an offer to buy the business.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.280]   I never thought that I would sell it.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.640]   It didn't seem like a business you could really sell to somebody.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.800]   And I sold it to them using seller financing.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.680]   What that means is that they put zero money down and they said,
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.400]   "Look, we're just going to run the business like we've been doing.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.920]   And yet we will pay you off over five years from all the profits.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.600]   So you get to lock in five years of profits of the business
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.200]   and have zero responsibility."
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.240]   And so that's how I sold the business.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.960]   And they've done so much better than I ever could have done.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.760]   They've taken the business to new places and it was a big win for everybody.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:46.680]   That's great.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.280]   There's an episode I think you've done on a podcast about it
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.400]   that I listened to briefly.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.520]   I'll link to that in the show notes.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.440]   But I just thought it was a cool story because most small business sales,
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.080]   nobody really talks about how that works.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.120]   And this was a different one.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.360]   Yeah, it was super unique.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.800]   And it now would give me the opportunity to do a lot of traveling myself,
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.480]   which I do have some questions for you about traveling myself
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.840]   whenever it's appropriate.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.520]   OK, so Nick ended up asking some great questions
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.040]   about round trip versus one way flights, getting flight refunds,
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.000]   using chase points on Southwest, avoiding jet lag and travel gadgets.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.760]   We also talked about where we'd go
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.680]   if we magically got a free weekend vacation without kids.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.960]   I got Nick's take on his trips to Kyrgyzstan and the Azores,
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960]   two places I've never been.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.640]   And I shared why we ended up deciding on an au pair versus other
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.960]   child care options.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.120]   However, despite that, those questions were really great
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.240]   since it was a bit off topic and ended up going almost half an hour.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.280]   I'm going to release it as a bonus episode this Friday.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.120]   So come back and check it out then.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.840]   And now back to the conversation.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.080]   You run a friend's newsletter,
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.120]   and I think I've seen you write that everyone should you talk about it?
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.560]   I think everyone should have a friend's newsletter.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.160]   When you were growing up, did your parents send like an annual
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.400]   Christmas card or holiday card with family updates?
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.520]   My grandparents always did.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.560]   Your grandparents always did. All right.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.160]   And what would be in that card?
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.720]   It was just here's everything we and all of our kids
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.800]   and grandkids families did this year. Yes. Yes.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.440]   My friend's newsletter came out of that tradition.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.160]   My parents were in the military.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.880]   And so that idea of giving this annual status update
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.960]   before social media, where we do daily status updates,
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.000]   that annual status update was something I wanted to do
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.240]   on a quarterly basis for my friends.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.200]   But I tried to add value.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.960]   So it wasn't just about me.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.840]   I'd include a nice Netflix show.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.000]   I'd seen a great movie or a book.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   I'm making recommendations for my friends about cool stuff.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   And I started it just every quarter sending to my friends,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.640]   throwing them on BCC, adding a little note.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.400]   Hey, if you don't want to get this, just write me back.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.440]   We'll still be friends. I won't be offended.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.960]   And it has been so powerful and helpful to me.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.160]   I'd encourage everybody to think about starting a friend's newsletter.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.200]   In many ways, the origin of the all the hacks newsletter
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.680]   was that many, many years ago, how I started this newsletter
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.840]   called Life Updates, and it was like once a year,
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.640]   a life update of what I was up to.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.280]   And then every time I started some new project, like somewhat
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.800]   folded them together and it kind of evolved and evolved.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.000]   And some people have been on it since then.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.440]   Some people have obviously just found out about it since launching the podcast.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.640]   What things when you were sending that newsletter?
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.280]   Think back to the earliest days, for example.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.600]   I can't talk about this now, but I added people who didn't ask to be added.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.120]   I just sort of spammed my friends a little bit.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.520]   And that helped me get started, to be honest.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.320]   But I'll tell you what, if I did 100 friends and if five of them
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.960]   were mad that I spammed them, the other 95 were not mad.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.800]   And some weren't even happy to receive my updates.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.920]   So because everyone likes to travel, I love to ask every one of my guests
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.560]   to pick a place anywhere in the world that they know well
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.880]   and tell someone who's there what they should do, what they should eat,
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.120]   where they should have a drink and kind of give them a few ideas.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.400]   All right, because I spent 13 years there, I'm going to say New York City,
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.920]   but I'm going to give some new ideas that maybe people may not have heard elsewhere.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.960]   Number one, the second best park in New York City.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.200]   The first best, obviously being Central Park.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.240]   The second best park in New York City is Washington Square Park.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.840]   It is a locals only filled with characters.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.920]   The vibes are immaculate.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.600]   You can go almost any time for people watching.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.160]   And it's very centrally located there at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.600]   I mentioned that there's two entrances.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.520]   There's two entrances at the Met.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.680]   You, listeners, can take the entrance at 81st Street to skip the lines.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.720]   Now, when else should you go to the Met?
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.640]   Well, on Friday and Saturday nights, because the Met stays open late till nine o'clock.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.200]   Most people do not know this.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.280]   I would suggest arriving at seven and you can enjoy the museum
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.120]   almost all to yourself.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.280]   So I would suggest that before the Met, why don't you go to Central Park
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:00.000]   and go to my favorite place in Central Park called Sheep Meadow?
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.960]   Sheep Meadow is a sprawling green area with skyscraper views.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.320]   It's a great place to have a picnic.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.000]   Really the best place in Central Park, in my opinion.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.760]   And then the last thing that I'll suggest is if you want a fun activity
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.120]   in New York City, I'm not sponsored, but there's a thing called Scott's Pizza Tour.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.720]   Scott is a classic tour guide in New York City,
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.040]   and he has a whole network of guides where they show you the behind
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.440]   the scenes of how the pizza is made and things like that.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.480]   I love that place. Scott's Pizza Tour.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.800]   That's awesome.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.920]   You've written about a ton of things on your blog,
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:36.560]   everything from Chrome extensions, you love using a virtual assistant,
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.360]   saving money, buying a car.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.080]   I had this lofty dream of getting to all of these topics.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.080]   We're not going to do that.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.120]   I definitely recommend people check out the book, check out the blog.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.440]   Where else can people find you online?
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.720]   What do you want them to check out before we wrap?
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.120]   So I wrote a book called The Two Hour Cocktail Party.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.240]   If you like this show, it's incredibly tactical and practical
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.400]   with a lot of specific instructions.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.360]   And the name of that book is called The Two Hour Cocktail Party.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:07.600]   If you go to my book website, www.party.pro,
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.960]   www.party.pro, you can get a free two page party checklist
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.800]   that includes an executive summary of my book with all that you need to know.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.960]   And you can download that there.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.200]   It's like a PDF file.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.600]   And then I do have a friend's newsletter, which I think is like my favorite
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.320]   newsletter.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.920]   Nobody likes to read my friend's newsletter more than I do.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.280]   And it's great.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.360]   Some people say it's one of their favorite newsletters
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.280]   after the All the Hacks newsletter, of course.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.720]   And you can find that on my website, which is www.nickgray.net
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:40.520]   n-e-t, nickgray.net.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.280]   And on social media, I'm @nickgraynews.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.360]   And the show notes will include how to host a clothing swap,
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.960]   how to host a happy hour, how to plan a networking event.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.080]   Other ideas that you can use to just bring people together.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.080]   Oh, here's the last thing I'll say.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.920]   All the stuff I've taught about is not rocket science.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   Hosting a party is something anyone can learn,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:03.240]   but no one really teaches us how to throw a well-run event.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.200]   This is something you can learn and you can become good at.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.640]   That just might change your life.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.720]   I love it. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.440]   Thanks for having me.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.960]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.760]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.720]   As I mentioned earlier, you can catch the great travel questions
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.800]   Nick and I discussed in a short bonus episode on Friday.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.840]   And if you haven't already left a rating or review for the show in Apple Podcasts,
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.560]   I'd really appreciate it.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.600]   I'm on a quest to get to a thousand reviews.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.800]   And every single one means so much to me.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.480]   Thank you so much to everyone who's already written one.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.880]   Finally, if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.720]   or just want to say hi, I'm Chris and all the hacks.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.520]   Or you can DM me on social.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.160]   See you Friday.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   [music]
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.160]   [music]
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   [music]
