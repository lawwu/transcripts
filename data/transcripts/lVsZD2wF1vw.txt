[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The universe appears to be 13.8 billion years old.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Earth is like 4.5 billion years old.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   In another half billion years or so, the sun will expand and probably evaporate the oceans
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   and make life impossible on Earth,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   which means that if it had taken consciousness 10% longer to evolve, it would never have evolved at all.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Just 10% longer.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And I wonder how many dead, one-planet civilizations there are out there in the cosmos
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   that never made it to the other planet and ultimately extinguished themselves or were destroyed by external factors.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Probably a few.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Channeling Carl Sagan.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   every hunter and forger, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there, on a moat of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   This is not true.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   This is false. Mars.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I think Carl Sagan would agree with that. He couldn't even imagine it at that time.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So, thank you for making the world dream.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And thank you for talking today. I really appreciate it.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Thank you.
