[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.720]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.800]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.340]   So let's talk about emotions.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.000]   Emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.860]   of our life experience.
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.240]   It's fair to say that emotions make up most
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.400]   of what we think of as our experience of life.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.760]   Even the things we do,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.720]   our behaviors, and the places we go,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.260]   and the people we end up encountering in our life,
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.880]   all of that really funnels into our emotional perception
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.600]   of what those things mean,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.640]   whether or not they made us happy, or sad,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.120]   or depressed, or lonely, or were awe-inspiring.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.080]   Now, one thing that is absolutely true
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.720]   is that everyone's perception
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.800]   of emotion is slightly different,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.720]   meaning your idea of happy is very likely different
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.480]   than my idea of what a state of happiness is.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.160]   And we know this also for color vision, for instance.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.020]   Even though the cells in your eye and my eye
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.080]   that perceive the color red are identical
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.820]   right down to the genes that they express,
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.880]   we can be certain, based on experimental evidence,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.480]   what are called psychophysical studies,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.960]   that your idea of the most intense red
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.100]   is going to be very different than my idea
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.280]   of the most intense red
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   if we were given a selection of 10 different reds
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.140]   and asked which one is most intense,
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.520]   which one looks most red.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.940]   And that seems crazy.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.220]   You would think that something as simple as color
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.880]   would be universal, and yet it's not.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.200]   And so we need to agree at the outset
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080]   that emotions are complicated,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   and yet they are tractable, they can be understood.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.920]   And today we're going to talk about a lot of tools
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.360]   to understand what emotions are
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.200]   for you to understand what your emotional states mean
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.680]   and what they don't mean.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.080]   And in doing that, that will allow you to place a value
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.120]   on whether or not you should hold an emotional state
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.200]   as true or not true,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.620]   whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't,
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.480]   as well as whether or not the emotions of others
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.980]   are important to you in a given context.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.840]   We're going to talk a lot about development.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.160]   In fact, we're going to center a lot of our discussion today
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.640]   around infancy and puberty.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.280]   We're also going to talk about tools
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.120]   for enhancing one's emotional range
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.920]   and for navigating difficult emotional situations.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.960]   I am not a clinical psychologist, I'm not a therapist,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.440]   but I do have some background in psychology.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.520]   And today I'm going to be drawing
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.640]   from the psychology greats, not me,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.680]   but from the greats of psychology who studied emotion,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   who studied emotional development,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.480]   and linking that to the neuroscience of emotion,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.160]   because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.100]   and the hormones and the neural circuits
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.700]   in the brain and body that underlie emotion.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.100]   So while there's no one single universally true theory
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.320]   of emotion, at the intersection
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.100]   of many of the existing theories,
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.560]   there are really some ground truths.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.820]   If we want to understand emotions,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.600]   we have to look at where emotions first develop.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.560]   And the rule that every good neuroanatomist knows
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.160]   is that if you want to understand
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   what a part of the brain does,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.720]   you have to address two questions.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.100]   You have to know what connections does that brain area make?
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.360]   And you need to know what's called the developmental origin
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.200]   of that structure.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   What are the brain areas for emotion?
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   And nowadays there's a lot of debate about this.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.320]   For years, it was thought that there might be circuits,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.560]   meaning connections in the brain
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.280]   that generate the feeling of being happy,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad, et cetera.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.560]   That's been challenged.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.780]   And yet I think there's good evidence
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.240]   for circuits in the brain,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.900]   such as limbic circuits and other circuits,
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.680]   that shift our overall states
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.260]   or our overall level of alertness or calmness,
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.840]   or whether or not they bias us
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   toward viewing the outside world
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.880]   or paying more attention
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.280]   to what's going on inside our bodies.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.580]   But the important thing to understand
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.600]   is that emotions do arise in the brain and body.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.020]   And if we want to understand how emotions work,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.080]   we have to look how emotions are built.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   And they are built during infancy, adolescence, and puberty.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.860]   And then it continues into adulthood,
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.800]   but the groundwork is laid down early in development
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.540]   when we are small children.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.240]   You were born into this world
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.500]   without really any understanding of the things around you.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.380]   Now, there are two ways
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.820]   that you can interact with the world,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.980]   and you're always doing them more or less
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.220]   to some degree at the same time.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.940]   Those are interoception,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.500]   paying attention to what's going on inside you,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.860]   what you feel internally,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.900]   and exteroception,
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.600]   paying attention to what's going on outside you.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.900]   Hold that in mind, please,
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.020]   because the fact that you're both interocepting
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.080]   and exterocepting is true for your entire life,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.380]   and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions.
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.080]   It's absolutely critical.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.060]   As an infant,
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.700]   you didn't have any knowledge of what you needed.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.160]   You didn't understand hunger.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   You didn't understand cold or heat or any of that.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.280]   When you needed something,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.180]   you experienced that as anxiety.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.120]   You would feel an increase in alertness
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   if you had to use the bathroom.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.680]   You would feel an increase in alertness if you were hungry,
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.920]   and you would vocalize.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.480]   You would cry out.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.380]   You would act agitated.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.320]   You might coo.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.920]   You might do a number of different things,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.460]   and then your caregiver, whoever that might've been,
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.680]   would respond to that.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.760]   So this is actually really important to understand
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.140]   that a baby,
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.040]   when you were a baby and when I was a baby,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.600]   we didn't have any sense of the outside world
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   except that it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.580]   All developmental psychologists agree
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.600]   that babies lack the ability
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.220]   to make cognitive sense of the outside world.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.680]   But in this feeling of anxiety
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.780]   and registering one's own internal state
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.820]   and then crying out to the outside world,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.260]   either through crying or subtle vocalizations
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.740]   or even just cooing, making some noise,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.800]   we start to develop a relationship with the outside world
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.400]   in which our internal states, our shifts in anxiety,
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.500]   start to drive requests
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.740]   and people come and respond to those requests.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.740]   And this gets to the basis of what emotions are about,
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.860]   which are emotions are really about forming bonds
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.640]   and being able to predict things in the world.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.820]   And at this point, I actually just want to pause
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.780]   and mention a really interesting tool
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.840]   that is trying to address this question
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.520]   of what are emotions and what do they consist of
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.060]   that you can use if you like.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.540]   This is an app, I didn't develop it,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.280]   I don't have any relationship to them,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.060]   but the app was developed by people at Yale
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.580]   and it's called Mood Meter.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.740]   What they're trying to do is put more nuance,
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.580]   more subtlety on our words and our language for emotions
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.020]   and be able to allow you to predict
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.980]   how you're going to feel in the future.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.020]   I'm on the app right now and I know you can't see this,
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.300]   but it's called Mood Meter.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.240]   You know, it says to me, hi, Andrew, how are you right now?
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   And I click the little tab that says, I feel,
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.400]   and I can either pick high energy and unpleasant,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.320]   high energy and pleasant, low energy unpleasant,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.720]   or low energy pleasant.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.640]   And I would say right now, I feel high energy pleasant.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.220]   So I just revealed to you how I feel.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.400]   So I click on that and then it gives you a gallery of colors
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.800]   and you just move your finger to the location
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.700]   where you think it matches most.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.660]   And as you do that, little words pop up.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.720]   So say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.800]   I would say I'm feeling right now, cheerful.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.520]   So you click that and then you just go to the next window
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.720]   and it just says, what are you doing?
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.680]   And this feels like play to me,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.280]   but I'm going to call it work and then that's it.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.520]   And then what it does is it basically starts
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.040]   to collect data on you.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.520]   You're giving it information and it starts to link that
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.480]   to other features that you allow it access to if you like.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.880]   And it starts helping you be able to predict
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.120]   how you're going to feel at different times a day.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.640]   And it points to a couple of really interesting features,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.280]   which is that we don't really have enough language
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.720]   to describe all the emotional states.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.220]   And yet there's some core truths
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.100]   to what makes up an emotion.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.240]   This can really help people, kids and adults,
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.780]   understand better what they're feeling and why,
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.640]   and when best to engage in certain activities
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.080]   and thankfully when best to avoid certain activities too.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   So the way this works is the following.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.100]   You need to ask yourself at any point,
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.600]   you could do this right now if you like,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.120]   what's your level of autonomic arousal?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.920]   Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.600]   the range of alert to calm.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   So if you're in a panic right now,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.000]   you are like 10 out of 10 on the arousal scale.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.520]   If you're asleep,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.480]   you're probably not comprehending what I'm saying,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.760]   although maybe a little bit,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.200]   but let's say you're very drowsy,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.880]   you might be at a one or a two.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   And then there's this other axis, this other question,
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.720]   which is what we call valence.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.200]   Now, valence is a value.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.800]   Do you feel good or bad?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.100]   I would say I feel pretty good right now
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.400]   on a scale of one to 10.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.680]   I'm like, I don't know, I feel like a seven.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.100]   So I'm alert and I feel pretty good.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.280]   And then there's a third thing,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.840]   which is how much we are interocepting
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.320]   and how much we are exterocepting, all right?
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.640]   So how much our attention is focused internally
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.320]   on what we're feeling and how much it's focused externally.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.640]   And this is always going to be in a dynamic balance.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.800]   So for instance, if you're really, really stressed,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.840]   oftentimes that puts you in a position
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.040]   to be really in touch with what's going on in your body.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.860]   If you start having a lot of somatic,
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.240]   a lot of bodily sensations,
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.300]   like your heart is beating so fast that you can't ignore it,
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.200]   then you're really strongly interoceptive.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.060]   So there's three things, how alert or sleepy you are,
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.480]   that's one, how good or bad you feel, that's two.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.080]   And then whether or not most of your attention
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.520]   is directed outward or whether or not it's directed inward.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.580]   And much of what we call emotions
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.280]   are made up by those three things.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.840]   Let's return to the infant.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.760]   There's the baby in the crib.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.000]   It's mostly interocepting.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.500]   As caregivers bring it what it needs, you hope,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.320]   milk, diaper changes, et cetera,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.400]   a warm blanket if it's cold,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.500]   pull off the blanket when the baby's fussing
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.000]   and it's too warm 'cause babies get too warm also,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   it starts to exterocept.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.920]   The baby starts to look into the outside world
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.960]   and start making predictions.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.800]   It starts wondering how much it needs to cry
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.760]   or predicting, well, if I cry like a little bit,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.480]   then mom comes over and I get my milk.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.740]   Babies are starting to evaluate and do all this,
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.420]   but they're not doing it consciously.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.120]   They're doing this in order to relieve anxiety.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.460]   As a young creature, an infant and young toddler,
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.040]   you were mainly focused inward
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.460]   and you started to understand what was going on outward
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.920]   as a way of predicting what would bring you relief,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.600]   what would remove your anxiety.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.720]   And that's where the fundamental rules of your experience,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.960]   your emotional experience were laid down.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.720]   So now let's talk about what kind of baby you were
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.820]   because that actually informs your emotionality now.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.660]   These are classic, they're actually famous experiments
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.600]   done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.960]   This is this classic experiment
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.920]   of what was called the strange situation task in which,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   and I'm describing it very coarsely here, I realize,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.600]   but a mother and child come into the laboratory.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:43.200]   The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.640]   And then the mother leaves.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.680]   The mother leaves for some period of time
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.600]   and then comes back.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.180]   And the research is devoted to understanding
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.140]   the response of the child when the caretaker,
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.600]   the mother or the father returns.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.360]   Bowlby and Ainsworth and many of their scientific offspring
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   and colleagues identified at least four patterns
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.640]   that babies display when their caretaker returns.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.020]   And they group these into group A, B, C, D,
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.900]   so much so that the kids were referred to as A babies,
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.320]   B babies, C babies, or D babies.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.800]   The first babies are the A babies.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.660]   When their caretaker would return,
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.940]   the infant would respond with happiness,
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.300]   with what looked like delight.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.620]   They would go to the caretaker, they seemed happy.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.140]   These are referred to as secure attached kids.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.620]   The B babies, as they're called,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.140]   were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.000]   when the caregiver would return.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.660]   So they would sometimes continue to play with their toys
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.740]   or they would be with the,
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.980]   they had an adult in the room while the parent was gone,
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.200]   they would stay with them.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.700]   These were referred to as avoidant babies.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.620]   The C babies would respond to the return of the caregiver
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.020]   with acts of annoyance.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.060]   They seemed kind of angry.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.620]   And those were referred to as ambivalent babies.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.540]   And then the third category, the D babies,
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.460]   were the disorganized babies.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.820]   The child avoided interactions with everyone
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.860]   and their behavior didn't really change
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.860]   whether or not the caregiver was there or not.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.100]   This work, this classic work,
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.740]   opened up a huge set of important questions
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.300]   that related to what is the reestablishment
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.700]   of the bond really about?
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.340]   I mean, what's actually being figured out here
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.620]   is not whether or not there are four categories of babies.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.680]   That's interesting.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.140]   But it presumably is more interesting to focus on
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.260]   what is it that defines a really good bond,
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.860]   a secure attachment or an insecure attachment
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.920]   or an avoidant attachment.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.760]   And the four things are gaze,
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.780]   literally eye contact, vocalizations,
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.820]   so what we say and how we say it,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.740]   affect or emotion,
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.460]   so the way that we express, you know,
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.740]   crying, smiling, et cetera, and touch.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.300]   But gaze, vocalization, affect and touch
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.940]   are really the core of this thing
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.420]   that we call social bonds and emotionality.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.220]   And it's clear from most all of the theories
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.920]   of emotional health that an ability to recognize
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.320]   when your own internal state is being driven primarily
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.700]   by external events as important
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.700]   for being able to emotionally regulate, right?
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.780]   People who are constantly being yanked around
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.960]   by the external happenings in the world,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.140]   you would say are emotionally labile.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.360]   They are not in control of their emotions.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.340]   Even if they're calm all the time,
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.860]   if that calmness only arrives
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.540]   because they're in a placid environment
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.540]   and then you put, you know,
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.940]   a cracker in that environment and they freak out,
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.220]   well, then they're not really calm.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.140]   So how much the outside environment
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.140]   disrupts your internal environment
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.440]   has everything to do with this balance
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.220]   of interoception and exteroception.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.660]   And it very likely has roots
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.540]   in whether or not you were secure attached
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.660]   or insecure attached, disorganized,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.060]   or ambivalent as a baby.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.380]   So while we can't travel back in time,
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.900]   there is an exercise that you can do
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.580]   to address at least in this moment,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.500]   whether or not you have a bias for exteroception
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.280]   or a bias for interoception.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.580]   If you close your eyes right now
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.820]   and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.020]   and trying to bring as much of your attention
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.740]   to that point of contact as possible.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.900]   And then from there,
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.940]   you're going to move your attention even more deeply
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.260]   into say the sensation of what's going on in your gut.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.080]   Are you full?
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.920]   Are you empty?
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.740]   Are you hungry?
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.860]   Are you not?
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.620]   Is your heart beating at what rate?
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.100]   What's the cadence of your breathing?
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.800]   Basically bringing your focus and attention
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.660]   to everything at the surface of your skin and inward.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.480]   So I'm going to do a rare thing
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.580]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.620]   I'm going to introduce about five to eight seconds of silence
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.860]   in order to allow you to do that a little bit.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:17.660]   Now try and do something
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.860]   that for most people actually is a little bit harder,
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.580]   which is to purely exterocept.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.300]   Put your eyes or your ears or both
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.700]   on anything in your immediate space.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.140]   I would say, look across the room,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.740]   pick a panel on the wall or a leg of a table or something
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.180]   and try and bring as much of your attention
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.480]   to that as possible.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.380]   And again, I'll take about five seconds of silence
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.540]   to allow you to exterocept.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:53.940]   Okay, so what you probably found
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.060]   is that you were able to do that,
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.780]   but that some degree of interoception is maintained.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.060]   It's hard to place 100% of your attention
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.500]   on something externally,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.580]   unless it's really exciting, really novel.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.960]   If you've ever watched a really great movie,
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.540]   presumably you're exterocepting
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.780]   more than you're interocepting
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.180]   until something exciting happens
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.360]   and then you feel something.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.940]   You're actually tethering your emotional experience
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.500]   to something external.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.260]   And now you can also do this dynamically.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.020]   You can decide to focus internally and then externally.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.180]   You can decide to split it 50%, 50% or 70, 30.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.220]   One can develop,
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.220]   you can develop a heightened ability to do this.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.900]   And the power of doing that is actually
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.500]   that when you are in environments
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.220]   where you feel like you're focused too much internally
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.820]   and you'd like to be focused more externally,
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.340]   you can actually do that deliberately.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.420]   But as you notice, it takes work.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.520]   These exercises are really what are at the core
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.780]   of these development of emotional bonds.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.500]   Because as we mentioned before,
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   these four things, the gaze, vocalization, touch and affect,
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.140]   those are happening very dynamically.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.560]   So if somebody winks at you,
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.920]   you're paying attention to their wink,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.180]   but then you also notice how you feel.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.520]   This is very dynamic.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.260]   So if it seems overwhelming to try and interocept
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260]   and exterocept and then shift the balance,
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.400]   you do that all the time.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.380]   Your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.600]   Now, some people have a very hard time breaking
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.820]   out of a very strongly interoceptive mode.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.980]   Some people have a harder time breaking
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.540]   out of their exteroceptive mode.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.540]   It's very interesting to note the extent
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.540]   to which we have biases in how interoceptive
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.140]   or exteroceptive we are.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.840]   Remember those three axes that we talked about earlier.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.720]   You have valence, good or bad.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.120]   You have alertness, alert or calm,
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.440]   and you have interoceptive or exteroceptive bias.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.680]   Early in development,
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.480]   you start off with this interoceptive bias.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.200]   You are starting to develop expectations,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.640]   predictions about how the outside world is going to work.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.200]   And you are trying to figure out the reliability
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.920]   of outside events and people and where things are reliable.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.180]   When people are reliable,
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.280]   we are able to give up more of our interoception.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.960]   There's literally trust that our interoceptive needs,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.800]   our internal needs,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.400]   will be met through bonds and actions of others.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.440]   This starts to veer toward the discussion
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.620]   about neglect and trauma.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.680]   We are going to devote entire episodes,
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.000]   probably an entire month, to trauma and PTSD,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.920]   but those have roots in what we're talking about now.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.440]   And it's important to internalize
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   and understand what we're talking about now
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.020]   in order to get the most out of those future conversations.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.860]   So now I want to just pause,
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.300]   just shelve the discussion about interoception,
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.600]   exteroception for a moment.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.400]   And I want to talk about what is arguably the second most,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   if not equally important, aspect of your development
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.800]   as it relates to emotionality
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.360]   and as it relates to this, what I call trust,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.960]   but this ability to predict
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.760]   whether or not things in the outside world are reliable
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.000]   or not reliable in terms of their ability
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.420]   to help you meet your interoceptive needs.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.820]   And that period is puberty.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.380]   So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.480]   not a lot of biology, not a lot of mechanism.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.940]   And now we're going to transition
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.220]   into talking about mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.100]   Puberty is a absolute biological event.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.340]   It has a beginning and it has a specific definition,
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.660]   which is the transition into reproductive maturity.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.180]   So there are a lot of hormonal changes.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.940]   Yes, there are also a lot of brain changes
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.140]   and most people don't realize it,
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.400]   but the brain changes occur first.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.980]   The brain turns on the hormone systems
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.380]   that allow puberty to occur.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.220]   One of the more interesting molecules
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.300]   that triggers puberty in all individuals
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   is something called Kispeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.660]   Kispeptin.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.700]   Kispeptin is made by the brain
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.900]   and it stimulates large amounts of a different hormone
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.900]   called GNRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, to be released.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.500]   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.340]   then causes the release of another hormone,
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.080]   something called luteinizing hormone or LH,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.220]   which travels in the bloodstream
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.620]   and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.660]   and the testes of males to produce testosterone.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.580]   Now, this is interesting because at this point,
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.240]   the testes in males start churning out tons of testosterone
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.220]   in order to trigger the development
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.620]   of secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.220]   body hair and all the others, deepening of voice, et cetera.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.180]   And in females, estrogen is doing various other things,
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.940]   breast development, et cetera.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.220]   So that's how puberty happens at the biological level,
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.180]   gets triggered by leptin and Kispeptin.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.620]   And then this young child
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.420]   is now a different creature to some extent,
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.340]   not just because they're reproductively competent,
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.840]   of course, but because there's a shift
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.000]   in a number of the things that underlie these social bonds.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.620]   There's a market shift in a number of the things
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.120]   that allow children and adults to engage
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.520]   in predictive behavior about each other.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.720]   And most of what consumes the minds
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.840]   and waking hours of adolescents
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.480]   and children who've gone through puberty
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.120]   and going through puberty is questions
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.500]   about how they relate to social structures,
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.180]   who they can rely on
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.780]   and how they can make reliable predictions in the world
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.360]   now that they have more agency,
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.980]   that they are physically changed.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.260]   In fact, you could argue that puberty
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.940]   is the fastest rate of maturation
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.100]   that you'll go through at any point in your life.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.020]   It's the largest change that you'll go through
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.380]   at any point in your life in terms of who you are,
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.420]   because your biology is fundamentally changed
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.900]   at the level of your brain and your bodily organs,
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.000]   all your organs from the skin inward.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.260]   So I want to visit a little bit of the research
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.080]   about some of the core needs
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.000]   that occur during puberty and adolescence.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.300]   So there's a terrific review article
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   that was published in the journal "Nature"
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.020]   about the biology of adolescence and puberty,
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.940]   as well as some of the core needs and demands
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.200]   that have to be met for successful emotional maturation
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.700]   during that time.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.460]   We will provide a link to that,
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.380]   but I just want to highlight a few of the things
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.580]   that they place in the final table.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.500]   I don't want to go through all the results right now
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.840]   because you could do that on your own if you like.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.940]   They mainly highlight a lot of the changes
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.880]   in neurons and neural circuits.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.900]   For instance, I'll just highlight one.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.580]   There's a connection between the dopamine centers
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.380]   in the brain and an area of the brain
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.020]   that's involved in emotion and dispersal.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.620]   Dispersal is very interesting.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.140]   What you observe in animals and humans
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.800]   is that around the end of adolescence
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.980]   and during the transition to puberty,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.940]   both because of changes in the brain
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.720]   and changes in hormones,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:17.380]   there's an intense desire on the part of the child
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.760]   to get further and further away from primary caregivers.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.380]   Mostly there's a desire to start spending more time
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.860]   with friends, more time with peers,
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.260]   and less time with adults.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.340]   So there's something about these hormones
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.700]   that don't just allow sexual reproduction.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.740]   They don't just change the brain and bodily organs
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.640]   and the shape of us.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.140]   They also bias us towards dispersal,
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.460]   getting further and further away
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.660]   from primary caregivers in particular.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.120]   And what's interesting is during puberty,
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.020]   there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it,
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.340]   between the prefrontal cortex,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.280]   which is involved in motivation and decision-making,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.020]   being able to suppress action
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.180]   for making long-term goals possible,
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.180]   as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.580]   So there's this really broad integration and testing.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.220]   I think this is the key element here,
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.420]   testing of circuits for emotions and reward
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.180]   as they relate to decisions.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.180]   And I think that's useful
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.460]   because when you look at the behavior
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.740]   of adolescents and teens,
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.500]   they are testing social interactions.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.580]   They are testing physical interactions with the world.
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.080]   Oftentimes they're engaging in unsafe behavior
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.640]   and I would never try and justify that
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.680]   with the underlying neurology,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.540]   but the neuroscience points to increased connectivity
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.840]   between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.440]   and to threat detection like the amygdala, but also reward.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.880]   So it's a time of testing behaviorally
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.520]   how different behaviors lead to success or not.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.360]   It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.920]   You can start to map the neurology
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.460]   onto some of this emotional exploration.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.700]   I do realize that this episode is about emotions.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.080]   Puberty is a time in which the internal state
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.760]   of the person or the animal is being sampled
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.680]   and tested against different extra receptive events.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.920]   Only now they are able to guide those events
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.640]   with more agency.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.000]   The child or the adolescent is now able,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.360]   the teen really is able to now sample many,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.880]   many more extra receptive events through behavior.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.620]   And so adolescence and puberty is really seen
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.200]   as the period of development in which one self-samples
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.000]   for these two elements that we talked about
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.160]   at the beginning, which are how do I form bonds
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.640]   and how do I make predictions
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.400]   about what will make me feel good
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.240]   at a level of interoception.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.920]   But in terms of the biology,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.220]   it's clear that there's this stage of development
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.360]   where more autonomy, more physical capability
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.000]   is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.440]   and these peptide changes in the brain and body.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.160]   And that nonetheless brings us back to the exact same model
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.220]   that we started with an infancy of alert or calm,
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.720]   feel good or feel bad,
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.080]   primarily exterocepting, primarily interocepting.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.480]   So I keep going back to this.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.600]   I'm sort of like a repeating record on that
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.000]   because the same core algorithm,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.840]   the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.440]   And that's a useful framework in my opinion,
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.520]   because it allows you to sort through all the data
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.880]   and information that's out there about,
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.120]   well, this area, the stria terminalis is active
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.800]   or the basal lateral amygdala is active
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.680]   or gray matter thickening or this hormone or that hormone
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.480]   and return to a kind of kernel
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.920]   of certainly not exhaustive truth.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.240]   It doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.260]   but at least establishes some groundwork
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.980]   from which you can start to evaluate
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.880]   how different behaviors might or might not make sense,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.680]   how certain emotional responses
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.440]   might or might not make sense,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.640]   regardless of the age of the person or the organism.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.840]   There's a theory of emotional development
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.460]   that I find particularly interesting,
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.540]   which is from Alan Shore at UCLA,
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.540]   that talks about how most of our testing of bonds
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.740]   and relationships is this seesawing back and forth
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.940]   between very dopaminergic, so driven by dopamine,
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.220]   or serotonergic, driven by serotonin states.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.440]   And this starts with infant and mother
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.620]   or infant and father.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.380]   Healthy emotional development clearly begins
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.300]   with an ability for the caretaker and child
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.860]   to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch oriented,
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.380]   eye gazing type of behaviors.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.700]   Those really drive serotonin,
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.340]   the endogenous opioid system, oxytocin,
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.540]   things that are very calming
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.640]   and are centered around pleasure with the here and now,
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.700]   as well as excited states of what we're going to do next.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.220]   There's actually a kind of characteristic sign
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.900]   of the dopaminergic interaction
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.020]   where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed,
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.500]   the pupils dilate, that's a signature of arousal.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.440]   They get really excited.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.980]   Oftentimes the baby will look away
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.500]   if it gets really excited.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.260]   Those are signatures of dopamine release in the body.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.420]   And in adolescence, these same things carry forward,
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.300]   where their good bonds are achieved
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.020]   through hanging around, watching TV,
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.140]   just kind of playing video games
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.060]   or texting together or talking,
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.000]   whatever it is that the soothing local activity
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.340]   happens to be, as well as adventure
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.740]   and things that are exciting.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.580]   And so this kind of seesawing back and forth
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.660]   between their different reward systems
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.380]   seems to be the basis
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.060]   from which healthy emotional bonds are created.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.960]   We can't have a complete conversation
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.460]   about emotions and bonds and social connection
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.580]   without talking about oxytocin.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.580]   Oxytocin has come to such prominence
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.380]   in the last decade or so,
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.660]   and seems to be everywhere.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.060]   Anytime you hear a discussion
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.340]   about neuroscience in the brain or hormones in the brain,
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:03.700]   oxytocin is released in response to lactation in females.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.500]   It is released in response to sexual interactions.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.000]   It is released in response to non-sexual touch.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.080]   It's released in males and females.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.260]   And indeed it's involved in pair bonding
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.340]   and the establishment of social bonds in general.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:29.040]   How it does that seems to be by matching internal state.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.540]   It seems to both increase synchrony
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.720]   of internal states somehow.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.320]   Maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.480]   That seems like a reasonable hypothesis.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.500]   As well as raising people's awareness
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.120]   for the emotional state of their partner.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.860]   And again, this brings us back
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.580]   to this alertness calmness axis
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.480]   and this interoceptive, exteroceptive axis.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.960]   In order to form good bonds,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.100]   we can't just be thinking about how we feel.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.740]   We also need to be paying attention to how others feel
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.120]   and we're evaluating a match.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.560]   We're trying to see whether or not
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.320]   there seems to be some sort of synchrony between states.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.080]   And oxytocin both seems to increase that synchrony
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.240]   and increase the awareness
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.800]   for the emotional state of others.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.360]   So here are some experiments
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.920]   that involve the administration of intranasal oxytocin.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.840]   What's been reported
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.300]   is increased positive communication among couples.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.400]   That study, just for those of you like,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.940]   was published in Biological Psychiatry,
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.440]   which my psychiatry colleagues tell me is a fine journal.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.520]   And the title is intranasal oxytocin
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.320]   increases positive communication
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.800]   and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.280]   during couple conflict.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.200]   They have them fight with and without oxytocin.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.240]   So interesting, very much in line with the idea
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.960]   that oxytocin is the quote unquote trust hormone.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.880]   The other molecule that we make that's extremely important
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.200]   for social bonds and emotionality
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.600]   is one that we're going to talk about more
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.720]   in the month on hormones, and that's vasopressin.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.100]   Vasopressin has effects on the brain directly.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.980]   It actually creates feelings of giddy love.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.540]   It also has very interesting effects
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.900]   on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.040]   This, again, we will revisit in the future,
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.940]   but there's a beautiful set of experiments
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.040]   that have been done in a little rodent species
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.480]   called a prairie vole.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.040]   It turns out there are two different populations
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.880]   of prairie voles.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.720]   Some are monogamous.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.320]   They always mate with the same other prairie vole.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.880]   And some are very robustly non-monogamous.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.240]   They mate with as many other prairie voles as they can.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.360]   And it turns out that levels of vasopressin
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.200]   and/or vasopressin receptor
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.480]   dictate whether or not they're monogamous or not.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.120]   And there's actually some interesting evidence in humans
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   when people report their behavior,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.100]   assuming they're reporting accurately,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.600]   that vasopressin and vasopressin levels
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.980]   can relate to monogamy or non-monogamy in humans as well.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.920]   We're going to talk about this in the month on hormones.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.740]   If we're talking about the neuroscience of emotions,
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.120]   we have to talk about the vagus nerve.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.120]   I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.480]   That's these connections between the body and the viscera,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.040]   including the gut, the heart, the lungs,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.960]   and the immune system, and the brain,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.480]   and that the brain is also controlling these organs.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.900]   So it's a two-way street.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.440]   There's this big myth out there that I mentioned before
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.720]   that stimulating the vagus in various ways
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.960]   leads to calmness, that it's always going to calm you down.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.600]   And that is false.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.280]   Now, this is interesting in light of emotionality
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.920]   because of work that's been done by many groups,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.180]   but in particular, I'm going to focus on the work
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.760]   of a colleague of mine, Karl Deisseroth at Stanford,
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.920]   who's a psychiatrist, but has also developed a lot of tools
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.440]   to adjust the activity of neurons in real time
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.880]   using light and electrical stimulation and so forth.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.920]   I'll refer you to an article in "The New Yorker"
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.480]   that was published about this a few years ago.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.920]   I'm going to read a brief excerpt,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.080]   but I'll put the link in the caption as well.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.120]   He's talking to an extremely depressed,
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.680]   suicidally depressed patient
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   who has a small device implanted
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.520]   that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.040]   They're in his office and they're talking,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.160]   and he asks her how she's doing.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.520]   And she describes how she's been doing previously
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.320]   as "going pancake,"
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.220]   which for her just means totally laid out flat,
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.800]   not much going on.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.860]   She talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.420]   She's really depressed.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.800]   And he says in typical good psychiatrist fashion,
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.100]   well, that's a lot to think about.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.400]   That's actually the quote.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.920]   And they talk about her blood pressure, et cetera.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.560]   And then she says, mood's been down, just spiraling down.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.760]   Talks about insomnia, bad dreams, low appetite.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.560]   So this is severe depression.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.720]   This is what we call major depression.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.000]   And then she requests,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.880]   can we please go up to 1.5 on vagus stimulation?
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.480]   She'd been receiving 1.2 milliamps of stimulation
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.480]   every five minutes to 30 seconds,
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.720]   but was no longer able to feel the effects.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.800]   So he says, okay, I think we can go up a little.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.300]   You're tolerating things well.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.200]   They start the stimulation and quote,
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.480]   "In the course of the next few minutes,"
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.560]   her name was Sally, "underwent a remarkable change.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.800]   Her frown disappeared.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.560]   She became cheerful, describing the pleasure she had had
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.080]   during the Christmas holiday and recounting
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   how she'd recently watched some YouTube videos of Dyseroth.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.480]   She was still smiling and talking when the session ended
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.180]   and they walked out to the reception area."
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.720]   So this is just by stimulating and activating the vagus.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.960]   Now, why am I bringing this up?
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.160]   Well, for several reasons.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.440]   One is the vagus is fascinating
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.920]   in terms of the brain-body connection.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.260]   Two, I'd like to keep trying to dispel the myth
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.740]   that vagus stimulation is all about being calm.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.440]   It's really about being alert.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.600]   I don't know how that originally got going backwards,
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.200]   but it's about being alert.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.920]   And once again, level of alertness or level of calmness
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.600]   is impacting emotion.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.280]   That this access of alertness and calmness
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.200]   is one primary access in emotion.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.320]   It's not the only one
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.360]   because there's also this valence component of good or bad.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.200]   And those two aren't the only ones
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.320]   because there's also this component of interoceptive,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   exteroceptive that we talked about earlier.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.480]   And there will be others too.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.260]   Again, it's not exhaustive, but I find it fascinating.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.960]   And it really brings us back to where we started,
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.300]   which is what are the core elements of emotion?
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.140]   And what can you do about them?
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.520]   This business of how you conceptualize emotions
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.540]   is really the most powerful tool you can ever have
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.660]   in terms of understanding
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.320]   and regulating your emotional state.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.220]   If you're willing to try and wrap your head around it,
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.580]   I realize it's not the simplest thing to do,
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.460]   but rather than think of emotions as just these labels,
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.360]   happy, sad, awe, depressed,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.880]   thinking about emotions, excuse me,
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.680]   as elements of the brain and body
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.800]   that encompass levels of alertness,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.360]   that include a dynamic with the outside world
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.680]   and your perception of your internal state.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.120]   And starting to really think about emotions
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.720]   in a structured way
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.260]   can not only allow you to understand some of the pathology
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.000]   of when you might feel depressed or anxious
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.520]   or others are depressed and anxious,
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.700]   but also to develop a richer emotional experience
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.580]   to anything.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.180]   So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.440]   from which you can start to think about
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.640]   your emotional life differently, I hope,
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.440]   as well as others in a way that builds more richness
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.380]   into that experience, not that detracts from it.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.660]   I want to thank you for your time and attention
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.860]   and thank you for your interest in science.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.440]   [upbeat music]
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.100]   (upbeat music)
