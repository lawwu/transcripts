[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.280]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.880]   and we open with a question from Nick,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.160]   who writes in, "Pastor John,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.700]   "I have been reading the Sermon on the Mount
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.940]   "in the Gospel of Matthew chapters five to seven.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.700]   "I know that the sermon given by Jesus
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.620]   "is meant to reveal the extent of our heart's sickness
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.520]   "and desperate need for his righteousness.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.660]   "There is one part that really threw me for a loop though.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.100]   "Jesus says in Matthew six, verses 14 and 15,
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.080]   "if you forgive others their trespasses,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.980]   "your heavenly father will also forgive you.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.520]   "But if you do not forgive others their trespasses,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.440]   "neither will your father forgive your trespasses either."
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.080]   Can you elaborate on what Jesus intends for us
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.860]   to take by saying this?
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580]   "My biggest concern is in my struggle to forgive others
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.940]   "of their sins.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.180]   "Does this mean that anyone who does not forgive others
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.080]   "cannot receive salvation from God?"
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.840]   - Before I say what I think that warning means,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.300]   that you won't be forgiven by God
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.620]   if you don't forgive others,
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.260]   before I say what that means,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.960]   let me make sure that Nick realizes
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   that if those verses about the unforgiveness
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.080]   the unforgiving being unforgiven threw him for a loop,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   which is what he says, "They threw me for a loop."
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.880]   If those words throw him for a loop,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.600]   there are others in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.920]   that are gonna throw him for more loops.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.260]   So for example, Jesus says in five seven,
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.260]   "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So receiving mercy comes to us through our being merciful.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.360]   That's almost the same as 615,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.080]   which he's being thrown for a loop by.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.200]   "We receive mercy at the judgment
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.840]   "if trusting Christ's mercy has made us merciful."
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.160]   James puts it this way, chapter two, verse 13.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.860]   "Judgment by God is without mercy
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.800]   "to those who have shown no mercy."
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   But mercy triumphs over judgment.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.520]   That is, if we show mercy,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.300]   our judgment will not be condemnation, it will be mercy.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.600]   That's the same problem, same issue that he's raising.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.360]   Or chapter five, verse 29.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.980]   "If your right eye causes you to sin,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.280]   "tear it out and throw it away,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.460]   "it's better for you to lose one of your members
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.420]   "than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.420]   Which means that failure to make eye-gouging war on lust
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.240]   will result in hell, same issue.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   Chapter seven, verse 16, Jesus says that,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.760]   "We will know the false Christians by their fruit.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.380]   "Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.260]   "or figs from thistles?
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.620]   "So every healthy tree bears good fruit,
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.760]   "but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.720]   "A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.860]   "nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.680]   "Every tree that does not bear good fruit
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.720]   "is cut down and thrown into the fire."
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   So again, he says, the absence of good fruit in our lives
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.960]   means fire.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.260]   But be sure to look at the words carefully here.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.320]   Bearing fruit doesn't make you a good tree.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.940]   A lot of people quickly jump to the conclusion
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.360]   that if there's some kind of conditionality
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.920]   at the judgment, namely that you have to bear good fruit,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.600]   you have to fight lust, or you have to be forgiving,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.160]   then we're somehow making ourselves into a good tree
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.360]   and earning salvation by those fruits.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.240]   Well, that's insane.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.560]   The text says a good tree bears good fruit.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.540]   If you have fruit, you're a good tree,
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.440]   not the other way around.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.200]   We're not saved by good fruit.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.080]   The good fruit shows that we're a good tree
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.000]   of faith in Jesus.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.080]   One more, or maybe two more.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.000]   (chuckles)
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.320]   Chapter seven, verse 21,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.120]   not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.320]   will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.520]   but the one who does the will of my Father who's in heaven.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.760]   On that day, many will say to me, Lord, Lord,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.400]   did we not prophesy in your name
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   and cast out demons in your name
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.640]   and do many mighty works in your name?
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.380]   And then I will say to them, I never knew you.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.840]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   So ascribing lordship to Jesus doesn't save anyone.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   We show his lordship by doing the will of his Father.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.880]   Without this evidence in our lives,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.240]   we hear the words, I never knew you.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.880]   And then he says, everyone, this is chapter seven,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.520]   verse 24, everyone who hears these words of mine
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.000]   and does them will be like a wise man
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.600]   who built his house upon the rock
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.360]   so he doesn't get swept away at the judgment.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.880]   And then he says, verse 26,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.380]   everyone who hears these words of mine
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.680]   and does not do them will be like a foolish man
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.120]   who built his house on sand
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.200]   and at the judgment, he gets washed away.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   So in other words, what threw Nick for a loop
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.160]   in chapter six, verse 15, is everywhere.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.940]   If you do not forgive others their trespasses,
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.880]   neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   Jesus is simply saying what he's saying everywhere else.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.460]   And the way I would put it like this,
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.460]   if the forgiveness that we received
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.300]   at the cost of the blood of the Son of God, Jesus Christ,
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.460]   if the forgiveness that we received
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.980]   at the cost of the blood of Jesus
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.660]   is so ineffective in our hearts
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.240]   that we are bent on holding unforgiving grudges
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.060]   and bitterness against someone,
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.060]   we are not a good tree.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.820]   We're not saved.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.900]   We don't cherish this forgiveness.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.100]   We don't trust in this forgiveness.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.720]   We don't embrace and treasure this forgiveness.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.180]   We are hypocrites.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.660]   We're just mouthing.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.660]   We haven't ever felt the piercing, joyful wonder
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.260]   that God paid the life of his Son.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.060]   I mean, what in the world could I hold a grudge
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.340]   against somebody when I have not been offended nearly
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.140]   like God has been offended so highly
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.580]   that he has to pay the life of his Son
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.180]   in order for me to be forgiven,
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.940]   which is exactly the point of Matthew 18
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.580]   with the parable of the unforgiving servant,
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.020]   which is like a parabolic form of chapter six, verse 15,
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.500]   where the servant owes the king a billion dollars.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.300]   It's just off the charts what he owes,
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.220]   and he gets forgiven freely.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.060]   And then he goes out and he feels it so little.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.500]   It means so little to him
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.420]   that he strangles his fellow servant for $10.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.140]   And when the king hears about it, he sends him to jail,
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.700]   and Jesus concludes that parable like this,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.380]   verse 35, chapter 18 of Matthew.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.660]   "So also my heavenly Father will do
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   to every one of you
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.380]   And it's not unique to Jesus.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.780]   It's everywhere in Paul as well.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.220]   First Corinthians 6.10,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.380]   "Revilers will not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.420]   He's talking to Christians.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.340]   Have I not warned you before?
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.340]   Revilers will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.780]   Then he adds, "Such were some of you,
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.700]   but you were washed, you were sanctified,
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.060]   you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.620]   and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.180]   So revilers, and what's a reviler?
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.580]   Well, somebody who hates and holds grudges
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.560]   and is unforgiving and bitter.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.700]   People like that don't go to heaven.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.980]   Not because kindness earns heaven,
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.860]   but because kindness is the fruit of the Spirit
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.900]   which is given to those who've been broken
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.820]   by the love of Jesus and have embraced the sweetness
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   of being forgiven, even though we've reviled God.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.660]   So when Nick asks, "Does this mean
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.380]   that anyone who does not forgive others
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.260]   cannot receive salvation from God?"
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.700]   The answer goes like this,
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   "Struggling to forgive is not what destroys us.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.460]   As long as we are in the flesh,
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.820]   we will do our good deeds imperfectly,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.540]   including forgiving and loving others."
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.300]   Jesus died to cover those imperfections.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.100]   What destroys us is the settled position
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.300]   that we are not going to forgive
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.660]   and we have no intention to forgive
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.700]   and we intend to cherish the grudge
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.140]   and fondle the wrong that someone did to me
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.420]   and feel the bitterness.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.340]   It feels good.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.620]   I like to go to bed with my wrath at night
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.820]   because he legitimately wronged me
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.020]   and I'm gonna hold this against him the rest of his life.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.540]   If we think we can be indwelt by the Spirit of Christ
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.540]   and not make war on that attitude, we are deluded.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.740]   So Nick, if you have settled in with bitterness
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.220]   and anger and grudges, and you're not fighting this
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.540]   by faith in the mercy of Jesus to you,
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.980]   I hope this APJ will unsettle you
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.980]   and give you the freedom in Christ to let it go.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.700]   Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.580]   I will repay.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.380]   He will settle accounts, Nick.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.180]   You don't need to.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Well said.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.340]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.980]   And Nick, thank you for the question.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.260]   Well, we have asked for your questions on technology
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.740]   and you have responded and we have a lot of questions
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.620]   and they keep coming in
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.700]   and please keep sending them in to us.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.100]   One listener, Josh in South Carolina,
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.940]   wants to know when is it time to give up our smartphones
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.820]   and revert to a dumb phone?
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.300]   It's actually a very good question
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.820]   and it's on the table tomorrow with John Piper.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.440]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
