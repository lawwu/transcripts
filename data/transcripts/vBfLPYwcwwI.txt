[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   I've got a question here from Jacob. Jacob asks, How do I realistically accomplish a
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.000]   digital detox? When all of my leisure is currently spent on technology, I am currently an online
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   student and I spend all of my vast amounts of leisure time on my phone. I really want
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.000]   to do a digital detox, but I believe it might be too drastic and unsustainable. So Jacob
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.040]   read my book, Digital Minimalism, where I really walk through how to do this. Two points
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.280]   here. One, I do not use the terminology digital detox. That term has been appropriated by
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.800]   people in the digital space in what I believe to be an inappropriate way. They took this
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480]   term that's most heavily used in substance abuse, and they completely changed it to be
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.600]   the opposite of its original use, its original intention, so I don't like it. So if you look
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.720]   in the substance abuse community, what is a detox? Well, you're literally trying to
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.280]   eliminate the chemical dependence on the substance and doing it under a controlled circumstance.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.080]   So you're at a detox center, so there is no alcohol there. And there's people there who
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.680]   can watch to make sure that from a health perspective that you're okay. So that's part
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.560]   of it. But the second part of it, and it's the part that makes the whole thing make sense,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   is that you also then re-engineer your life during this process so that when you come
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   out of it, you no longer have that relationship with the substance that caused the problem
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.120]   in the first place. You would not run a very successful, let's say, alcohol detox center
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.520]   if you say, "Here's our plan. You come here, you spend the month, it's really hard, you
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.240]   get the DTs, trying to get off your alcohol dependency, you white knuckle it, we get you
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.080]   off of it. And then on day 31, we all go to the bar to celebrate you doing it." You don't
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.400]   know, you build a whole life without alcohol. And yet in the digital community, they have
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.640]   taken this term, and they apply it to mean exactly that. Like, "Yeah, let's take a break
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.680]   from these technologies that we feel like are ruining our lives before going back to
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.120]   using them as before." That is the opposite of the intention of a detox. So I do not like
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   that term. So I introduced a new term in my book, declutter, digital declutter. And you
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.960]   spend 30 days away from all these optional technologies with the goal of completely rebuilding
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.320]   your digital life from scratch when you're done so that it's something that is sustainable
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.000]   and a source of good, not bad. So no detox, declutter. Read the book and I walk through
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.400]   how to actually do it. The key thing you're going to see is that if this is going to work,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.780]   you have to aggressively fill the newly free time with experimentation and reflection.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.840]   You have to actually go do lots of other activities, learn new things, try new things. You have
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.720]   to join things and go places. You have to spend a lot of time alone with your own thoughts
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.120]   and reading. Active, active, active. That is the key, Jacob, is you replace what you're
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.560]   doing before with things that are better. You get much more insight about what matters
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   to you, what you find important, what real pleasure feels like versus superficial dopamine
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.120]   hacking that these devices are doing. And then when you're done with those 30 days,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.560]   you rebuild your life from scratch. Read Digital Minimalism, chapter three, I believe, will
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.520]   walk you through exactly how, exactly how to do it. And I got to say, Jacob, you need
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.480]   to do it. You are spending, and I'm quoting you, vast amounts of leisure time on your
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   phone. That is a simulacrum of a real life. You, my friend, are in the matrix, but if
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.080]   they were running the matrix off a kind of sucky computer, you're in like an Apple IIe
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.120]   matrix where it's not only like a simulation of life, but a pretty bad simulation, pretty
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.520]   impoverished simulation of life. You don't even know the feelings of deeper satisfaction
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.240]   you could be experiencing. You don't even know the sense of competency and awe and gratitude
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.560]   that you could be feeling. You don't even know what's possible professionally with building
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.960]   skills and crafts and seeing your intentions in your brain be made manifest concretely
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.080]   in the world, the quiet satisfactions that provide, the non-trivial sacrificing of time
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.240]   and attention on behalf of people that you really care about. There is a depth and a
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.960]   resilience that is possible in life. It makes life not only worth living, but allows you
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.800]   to go through the ups and the downs with your head held high and still doing good in the
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.360]   world. All of that is possible once you stop spending your vast amount of leisure time
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.960]   just looking at your phone. You are clocking in right now into a factory, my friend, a
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.040]   factory that is being run by a small number of social media companies. And you're doing
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.160]   long shifts, producing stuff for them that's valuable for them. And you're doing it for
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.560]   free and you're doing it at the sacrifice of the stuff that really matters in your life.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   Quit that virtual job in the Instagram factory and let's build a deeper life. And this podcast
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.840]   will help you do it. Look at my episodes about the deep life. Keep listening, but I want
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.480]   you to get better.
