[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:41.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:57.600]   Today we pick up a long neglected series called "How to Find an Excellent Wife". This is part two of the series. Part one was released as episode 615 on January 8, 2019. Part one was entitled "The Preparation".

[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:18.420]  ley discuss in. I can have,,,,,
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:45.180]   entregue. I think the type of job that you do, the type of business that you operate, I think you should start with a lot of attention to your career and income plan before you bother with the stuff of financial planning. For example, I'm kind of semi a part of what's called the fire movement, the financial independence, early retirement movement online, kind of sort of on the periphery of it. I'm not any radical personal finance, not at the core of that, but certainly friendly to it.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.020]   It's a big thing that I like to point out is that to me, you know, planning for early retirement makes no sense unless that early retirement plan is preceded by careful and thoughtful career development. Doesn't make any sense in the world to me to work at a job that you're poorly suited for, for years while practicing extreme savings just so that you can quit and do something that you love. Why not just build a career from the beginning that's something that you'd be happy to do for the rest of your life?
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:44.040]  , and then on the foundation of that career, which you'd be happy to never retire from, then on that career, build your income to a massive degree, keep your expenses extremely low, become financially independent. If you want to quit then you got the best of both worlds. But my contention is you probably won't quit if you get the career and income right. So the point is that big structural things are antecedent to personal finance tips and then things like your career and income is antecedent to your retirement plan.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:07:13.780]   And then there are all kinds of other things that are also even antecedent to a career and income plan or that go along with it. And marriage and marriage decisions would be one of those things that are in many ways antecedent to anything else. I think that if you get the marriage decision right, almost everything else has a higher chance of falling in line. But if you get the marriage decision wrong, then almost everything else is brutally difficult. On the right side, in terms of just simply importance, for example, me.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.060]   I'm a big fan of the career and income plan. I think that if you get the marriage decision right, almost everything else has a higher chance of falling in line. But if you get the marriage decision wrong, then almost everything else is brutally difficult. On the right side, in terms of just simply importance, for example, me.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:44.080]   I think that if you get the marriage decision right, almost everything else has a higher chance of falling in line. But if you get the marriage decision right, almost everything else has a higher chance of falling in line. But if you get the marriage decision right, almost everything else has a higher chance of falling in line.

[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:44.200]  , and yet many people's approach to marriage is basically, well, I'm happy now, and if I meet the right person someday, I might consider getting married.

I don't fault them and that's why I want to talk about this in this show. I think we should start however by recognizing simply how we can do this in this show.

[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:13.840]   Now you say Joshua are you opposed to men supporting their children? No.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:13.920]   Now you say Joshua are you opposed to men supporting their children? No.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:23.320]   It's nothing like the reality of a father and a mother who are married, live together, and are going through situations and supporting their children.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   Because those things can change.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:33.460]   If I go into financial trouble, I don't have to just keep making my wife a monthly payment of the amount of money that she needs and demands from me.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.460]   We are going to tighten our shoes.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.520]   We're going to tighten our, whatever, the budget, tighten the budget.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   If I am having trouble and I'm going through financial difficulty,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:43.720]   I'm going to tighten the budget.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   If I am having trouble and I'm going through financial difficulty,
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:43.940]   I'm going to tighten the budget.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   If I am having trouble and I'm going through financial difficulty,
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   If I am having trouble and I'm going through financial difficulty,
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   if I'm having trouble and I'm going through financial difficulty,
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   if I'm going to tighten the budget, tighten the budget, tighten the budget.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:30:13.960]   if I'm having trouble and I'm having trouble giving my children all the things that they have, I'm not a bad father because I have to pull them out of swim lessons and pull them out of private school and do those things. That's what families go through. But just imagine having that bill imposed on you where in order to get anything changed you have to go through an expensive court battle if it ever does get changed. In general it doesn't happen. You just have a bill every month. It's a brutal system.

[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:50.700]   And then I sit back and listen. And the answer to that question is extremely revealing. Now, what I always want to hear is under no circumstances.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:32:02.020]   I want someone to say, "Under no circumstances will my wife divorce me." Prior to my wife and my engagement, that was what we talked about.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:08.600]   We said, "Listen, if we're going to get married, we're in it for life. There are no circumstances that will ever lead to divorce."
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   We said, "Listen, if we're going to get married, we're in it for life. There are no circumstances that will ever lead to divorce."
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   We said, "Listen, if we're going to get married, we're in it for life. There are no circumstances that will ever lead to divorce."
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   We said, "Listen, if we're going to get married, we're in it for life. There are no circumstances that will ever lead to divorce."
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:37.580]  ,
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:37.640]   Now, obviously I'm not so naive to say that it could never happen. People could change. People go crazy. All kinds of things happen under the pressures of life. The person that you are at 25 is not the same person that you may be at 45. You may be hopefully much better. You may be much worse. All kinds of crazy stuff happens. But if you start with anything except absolute permanence of the marriage, it's very hard to see how you get better from there.

[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.040]   if you don't want to commit adultery on your wife, you can choose to not abandon your wife. You have to think ahead and
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.740]   you have to think ahead and if you think that you might face sexual temptation, you have to think ahead and make a plan for how you can remain chased and faithful to your wife in those circumstances. But at least men who commit adultery on their wives and are subsequently divorced, at least they bear the responsibility for that. They bear the blame for that initiating cause. Here's the problem in the United States with marriage at this point in time.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:11.020]   Almost nobody uses that kind of standard as a standard for permissible divorce.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:17.420]   Rather, in the wake of the no-fault divorce revolution of the 80s in the United States of America,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:24.220]   Now people can divorce for just about any reason or no reason at all as it is officially codified in law.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.840]   So now if you marry a woman,
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.680]   the answer to under what circumstances will she divorce you can sometimes be,

[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:31.560]   Why would you ever put yourself in a situation where on the mere basis of feelings or personal unhappiness you could have your entire life ripped apart.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   And this is the great danger.

They mean until I fall out of love with him or I fall out of love with her or I just wasn't happy or I just didn't have the tingles anymore. Now forgive me if I sound sarcastic. I'm trying to use a little bit of emotional verve to try to show how foolish this is, and yet this is what our society is structured on. And all you need to do is if you think I'm being too strong, sit and talk with a man or a woman.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:40:16.520]   who's been abandoned by their spouse because they were depressed, or because they got the hots for somebody else, or some of these kinds of things. It is brutal. And the impact goes far. And yet our whole society is seemingly structured on, well, you'll find someone else. It'll be okay. It's not. You won't. It's not okay. It doesn't get okay. And the best way in advance to avoid it is simply avoid the whole thing. And if you think I'm being too strong, sit and talk with a man or a woman.

[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:44.580]   If you don't believe that sexual activity must be reserved for marriage, there's a very decent chance that you will never marry well. Because if you study the data that is collected on the number of sexual partners that a person has prior to marriage, for every number, for every n over 1, the chances of a successful marriage goes down. The strongest marriages occur between two people who have a total number of sexual partners that are not married.

[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   I have a couple of men who had real challenges. Not everything can be solved by marriage, just speaking generally and broadly. The challenge is if you don't do that, the chances, again, the chances of marrying successfully become very, very small.

[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:44.620]  ,
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:44.620]   It's not an appropriate exclusive reason.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:44.620]   So you have to develop self-discipline.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:44.620]   It's not an appropriate exclusive reason.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:44.620]   So you have to develop self-discipline.

[00:51:44.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   So you have to develop self-discipline.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   And you have to exercise those things even after marriage.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   Now, this is perhaps the most incendiary of claims,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   Because in the modern world, people worship at the altar of sexual fulfillment.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   The number one ethic that is preached by the culture at large is sexual fulfillment.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   It is the highest god in the land.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   Whatever your sexual desire is, that must be requited.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:44.660]   I'm not saying that you should worship at the altar of sexual fulfillment.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   It's a very couple of exceptions which are currently unthinkable for people.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   That are forbidden.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   Our culture is one that worships at the altar of sexual desire.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   It's a false god.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   It doesn't work.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   It doesn't satisfy.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   Unfortunately, the process through that is often very painful.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   You go find the stories. You go talk to the people. The process through is deeply painful. But that's the primary reason. Primary reason is that the culture is deeply painful.

[01:06:42.340 --> 01:07:06.060]  , it wasn't needed. It wasn't necessary. Because the culture provided it for you. The culture was always pushing you. Stronger in some cultures, weaker in others, but it was accepted. But today, that doesn't exist anymore.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:10.840]   Now this is doing something interesting with the divorce rate. The divorce rate in the United States of America is falling.

But today, that doesn't exist anymore. This is doing something interesting with the divorce rate. The divorce rate in the United States of America is falling.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:29.380]   Now I don't think it's falling. The reason seems to be, at least one explanation of that data, seems to be, in my opinion, that the people who are marrying are the kind of people who are intentionally choosing marriage and they have a higher degree of commitment. That's good. I fear for many others, but that's good.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:39.380]   So the point is this: we live in a culture in which about the only orthodoxy that is present is that, well, if you love somebody, you can choose to marriage them or not.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:08:07.900]  , and if marriage, marry them or not, and if that love grows cold, then, well, you can choose to not marry, be married anymore. I don't think that's a very healthy place for a society to be. But you will have to think. You will have to assess it. I hope you'll agree with me. Maybe you won't. But at least consider it. Because in today's world, if you're going to actually build and find an excellent wife, you're going to have to be a very unique person.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:07.900]   Because all the decades of marriage, you're going to have to be a very unique person.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:08.900]   Because all the decades of marriage, you're going to have to be a very unique person.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:09.400]   Because all the decades of marriage, you're going to have to be a very unique person.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.440]   stacked against you.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   stacked against you.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:23.440]   stacked against you. And if you're going to sustain a marriage without the traditional legal support, cultural support, family support, religious support, you're going to have to be going against the tide.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   So do your research, and I hope that this helps you.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   I think, in summary, I think that people, that marriage is a wonderful idea.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:39.420]   If you are committed for life, and if you can find a woman who is committed for life and is willing to do anything for you,
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:39.420]   I think, in summary, I think that people, that marriage is a wonderful idea.
