[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.400]   Today, I'm going to have my first interview guest.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920]   Before we start, I have a few points I'd like to cover.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.560]   First, I don't want you to focus on who the guest is when you see it pop up in your iTunes
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   feed.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.160]   I have access to some very smart, successful people, and my goal is to ask them the right
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.880]   questions to help us take a step further today.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.440]   Since this is my first time, it did take a little time for me to get my flow going, and
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.240]   the second half of the show really starts to cover some great insights.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.840]   I know this episode is very long, and I debated cutting it into two, but what I've chosen
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.680]   is to just release it as one and let you choose how to break it up and listen to it based
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.600]   on your schedule.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   Don't worry if it takes you a few different sessions to make it all the way through.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.160]   There are going to be a lot of pearls that come out, and as we get to the second half,
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.960]   we will talk more about habits and mindsets.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.040]   Since this is my first interview, I'm essentially leaping with a parachute.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.160]   After all, what's the worst that could have happened?
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:53.280]   I could have just scrapped it and never released it.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.560]   Today we're going to chat with Joshua Sheets at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.840]   Joshua has a ton of letters after his name with regards to his financial credentials,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.000]   and I'm going to let him tell you all about them.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.320]   Joshua is the embodiment of someone who walked away from a lucrative career to live life
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.040]   on his terms.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   Joshua lives on far less than most of us and enjoys his life in Palm Beach, Florida, where
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.120]   he can spend the day with his kids at the beach and still have enough income to live
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   the life he chooses to live.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.800]   His podcast, Radical Personal Finance, is an amazing collection of in-depth knowledge
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.960]   on various financial topics.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.400]   I encourage you to check it out.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.040]   Without further delay, let's talk to Joshua.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.560]   Hello Joshua Sheets.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.480]   Welcome to Rich or Soul.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.920]   Awesome to be with you.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.360]   Hey, it's awesome to have you here too.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.960]   I know that you have a lot of experience and background in finance, and you've got a lot,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   a lot of letters after your name.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.160]   It's a little bit obscene, eh?
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.720]   Can you spout them all off?
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.600]   So the letters, if I can remember them all as I usually use them, is Joshua J. Sheets,
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.240]   MSFS, CFP, CLU, CHFC, CASL, RHU, REBC.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.840]   And they stand for Masters of Science in Financial Services, which is a master's degree in financial
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   planning.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.880]   CFP is a certified financial planner designation.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.600]   CLU is Chartered Life Underwriter, which is a life insurance designation.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.680]   CHFC stands for Chartered Financial Consultant, which is similar to the CFP in terms of its
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   scope.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.920]   CASL is Chartered Advisor for Senior Living, which is a small kind of retirement planning
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   specialty.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.320]   What comes next?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   RHU is Registered Health Underwriter, which is a health insurance specialty.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   And REBC is Registered Employee Benefits Consultant, which is a specialization in employee benefits.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.720]   So I don't think anybody has ever gotten all those details out from me.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.500]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.800]   So clearly, suffice to say, you understand money, you understand planning, and you understand
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.360]   how to do all of that.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.700]   And you actually spent some time being a financial planner, working for a company.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.640]   So what was that kind of background all about?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.200]   Yeah, so I've always interested in money.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.600]   Started when I was younger, when I was a teenager, reading books on personal finance and investing.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.240]   And after college, I worked in the business world for a little bit, doing some marketing
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.120]   consulting as a low-level analyst.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.680]   And I got laid off from a job.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.640]   I didn't know what to do, but I knew I wanted to build my own business, but I didn't have
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.520]   any great ideas about what product to sell.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.440]   And so finally, I figured out, well, if I go into the financial services business, I
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.160]   can run my own business as an entrepreneur, get all of the benefits of entrepreneurship
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.280]   without having to come up with a product.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.760]   So for that, plus my longtime interest in finance, I joined a company called Northwestern
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   Mutual.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.880]   And I spent a total of six years with Northwestern Mutual from 2008 till 2014, working as a financial
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   advisor.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.880]   I learned a lot.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   It was a tremendous experience.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.520]   I taught me a lot, which I then brought to the world of financial media, because I got
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   so frustrated with all of the media options that were out there at that time.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.240]   Well, so that's an interesting thing.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.980]   So you have this lucrative career, in a sense, paid your dues, and you're probably turning
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.720]   a corner there, and you're about to make a lot of money, and you quit.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.440]   There are two corners in the financial advice business.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   One is three years.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.480]   It took me three years until I finally felt like, okay, I'm not going to die.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.280]   And then after five years, if you can make it five years, the industry statistics say
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.620]   that you'll make it, everything's golden.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.020]   The financial services business is a weird business.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.920]   It's a very delayed, deferred compensation business.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.280]   In the first few years, you are way overworked and underpaid.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.500]   And then the goal is, in the back of your career, to get to the point where you're underworked
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.520]   and overpaid, if you can get there.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.880]   But there's tremendous attrition, and it's tremendously challenging to start it as a
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.680]   business because you're basically combining the learning process that many professionals
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.080]   go to school for, law school, medical school, et cetera, you're combining the learning process
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.560]   with entrepreneurship, but building a business.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.000]   And entrepreneurship is very, very challenging.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.640]   And then because of the slow moving pace of financial services clients, it takes a long
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   time to build it up.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.080]   So yes, after five years, I was finally in a position to where I felt like I could really
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   start to rest.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080]   I was doing well.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   My practice was established.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.480]   I was working in an area specializing in retirement planning.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.040]   I had done all those designations.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   I finally wasn't as scared going into client meetings as I was when I was 23 years old.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   And I was ready to do it.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   And I was making good money.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.920]   I had passive income, I think $3,000, $4,000 a month of passive income, which since I'm
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.120]   good at living on low amounts of money, allowed me to have the flexibility that I had always
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.800]   wanted to not have to work in any given month if I didn't want to, if I just wanted to sit
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.920]   back and enjoy my renewals and my steady, again, passive income.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:08.840]   And then I walked away from it all, which was a very expensive decision and not an easy
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.000]   one to make.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.760]   So why did you leave?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.840]   Why did you walk away from it all?
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:22.880]   I have this crazy idea that life and business and career can be really well integrated.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:30.760]   And I would say that the financial services business for me was probably about a 75% good
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.320]   fit.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.640]   There are some aspects of me and my interests that fit really well in the financial services
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.920]   business, but there's about 25% of it that didn't fit me very well and certain things
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   about it.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.480]   And I mean, there's lots...
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.240]   I know what those things are.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   Would you mind sharing?
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240]   Sure.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.840]   The first thing that always dogged my heels in the financial services business is I get
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.280]   bored very easily.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.440]   So all of those financial planning designations mean I'm good at taking tests.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.320]   But there were other people who didn't take a single test and who just put their nose
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.920]   to the grindstone and saw client after client after client and made a lot more money than
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.280]   I did in six years.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.440]   So I had this impressive string of designations after my name.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.960]   Other people had more money because they worked harder.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.680]   Well, me, I got bored stiff having the same conversation again and again and again and
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.960]   again, which is why I study.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.280]   I like to learn.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.760]   So I used to feel like if I have to sit down at one more kitchen table with another young
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   couple and explain what term life insurance is and how the different options are for how
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.080]   term life insurance works and whole life insurance and here's what it is and here's how it works
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.400]   and disability insurance, I would get so frustrated.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   I don't want to do this.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.640]   What on earth should I repeat the same thing a hundred times with a hundred people when
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.200]   I can just make a tape recording and say, here, listen to this and do it and fill out
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   these applications.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.400]   Like I don't want to repeat the same thing over and over again.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.040]   And that is not a good character trait to have for success in the financial services
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   business.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.360]   You should be able to do the same thing over and over again.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.600]   So I have a very restless personality.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   I like to learn.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.200]   And so what that would mean is that basically about every two years or every year, two years,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.320]   I would completely redesign my practice and I would say, okay, I'm going to go from life
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   insurance.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.720]   I'm going to become a long-term care insurance specialist.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.600]   Now I'm going to move to disability insurance and I study everything there was to know.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.020]   And now I'm going to go to invest in sound and go to retirement planning, et cetera.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.040]   And so I knew that about myself that I couldn't conceive of having the same conversations
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.800]   for over the course of a 30 year career.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.460]   I was bored stiff.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.640]   And so I knew I needed to make a change.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.340]   Now I was pretty, I had a lot of flexibility in that business, but when I worked out my
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.240]   master plan for the media business that I now run, I felt like it would give me, it
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.360]   would work with my personality because I love to always be learning something new.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.600]   And for a learner, when you can put a learner into the role of a teacher and get paid for
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.000]   teaching that's basically heaven on earth for a learner.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   That sounds awesome.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   So I know a lot of people today are hopping into the internet business.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.420]   There's tons of ads comes across my Facebook of how, you know, within three months you
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.760]   go from nothing to a million followers and money is just flying in the door and you're
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.560]   living in your fancy house with the Ferraris in the garage.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.920]   What's the reality of this and what was the hardest part for you to make this transition?
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.240]   Well, let's start with the hardest part because that will go into the reality.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.120]   The hardest part for me was I had no idea what the transition was be like.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.800]   The analogy that I use is that for me to build what I wanted to build, which is a media company
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.200]   around financial education and I want to get rich doing it.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.960]   For me to do that was basically like saying I'm going to get rich by writing a bestselling
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   novel.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.700]   I mean, it's possible in theory, like there have been people who've gotten rich by writing
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.160]   bestselling novels, but the ability to actually force that process to happen, to plan it out
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.760]   and to do it is complete.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.620]   I mean, it's not possible to prove that.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.840]   It's more of, okay, certain things come together at the right time and the audience responds.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.240]   So when I was trying to build out a business plan in order to support my family, because
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.740]   I'm not financially independent and I wasn't in the place where I could just live on the
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.260]   income from my investments, I'd spent six years building this business and for me to
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.960]   walk away, I walked away from all of it.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.220]   Like I walked away from two pensions.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.420]   I walked away from all my clients, all my revenue.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.040]   So I didn't know how long it would be until the new business made any money.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.020]   So the big challenge was figuring out how can I do it?
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.980]   I didn't know, do I need to save $10,000 in the bank?
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.620]   Do I need to save $100,000 in the bank?
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.660]   Do I need to float my expenses for 10 years?
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.800]   How does this work?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.660]   So the conclusion I came to as well, if I just work, find some job that doesn't require
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.740]   me to make any kind of long-term commitment, but it's sufficient for me to pay my bills
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.500]   and do that while building the business, then I'll be able to do it.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.500]   So that was what I did and it took a year.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.380]   It took me a year of hard work before I was able to support my family based upon the revenue
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.780]   and the income from the business.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.340]   So to the question of internet businesses, is it possible to build an internet business
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.660]   that in a relatively short period of time?
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.660]   Yes, I've done it.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.740]   In a year, my business was profitable enough to support my family and to make, I spend
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.100]   about $3,000 a month.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.540]   So it was able to get to that point in about a year, which was good and it's continued
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.680]   to grow since then.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.100]   But I would say that I think a lot of the dreams about internet businesses are certainly
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.380]   not anchored in reality.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.940]   It's a business just like anything else.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.140]   And yes, it's nice to sit at home and work from home, but there are a lot of days where
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.020]   you doubt what you're doing and you want to go get a job.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.280]   I mean, entrepreneurship is days where you are thrilled about how phenomenal what you're
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.500]   doing is, and there's days where you just want to go get a job.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   And so it's a business like anything else with high points and low points and challenges.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.020]   And the internet is just a medium, a different way for you to market and sell your products.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.360]   There's no magic in it.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.940]   And I'm sure there's people sitting at work now dreaming of having their own business.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.940]   Hey, I've been there.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.940]   I've been there.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.940]   And I think that's normal.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.940]   It's normal.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.760]   My experience with entrepreneurs has been that is the normal process, even including
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   internet people.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.360]   If you talk to people who aren't trying to sell you a course on how to get rich online,
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.700]   you'll find that most of us will give the same answer.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.700]   It's great.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.700]   Now we love it.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.620]   It works for us, but it's not perfect.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.940]   Nothing is perfect.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.940]   It's hard work.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.940]   Absolutely.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.940]   It's a lot of hard work.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.940]   Trust me.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.820]   I have bled and sweat and poured myself into what I've done.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.500]   It has been many, many thousands of hours of hard work.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.220]   So I was listening to one of your recent shows and you made a comment.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:52.240]   You said, "Financial planners don't know how to write financial plans."
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.480]   And so I was wondering a little bit about that.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.380]   What was that kind of about?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:03.620]   I think it was maybe it's that they're salespeople or maybe there was something else.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:08.460]   So all these terms are very nebulous and I'll break it down in a few ways.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.740]   The whole financial industry is fundamentally broken because there's a major disconnect
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.500]   between how people talk and as far as how advisors and how experts talk versus what
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.380]   people actually do and how people act.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.820]   So first let's talk about the word financial advisor.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.700]   Financial advisor, if we didn't have any context from financial services, could mean many different
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   things.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.460]   Let's say that I'm helping somebody figure out how to write down a balance their checkbook.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.020]   Well, I'm advising them on their finances, so I'm therefore a financial advisor.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.380]   Or if I'm helping somebody get a good deal on a mortgage by selling them a mortgage,
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.100]   I'm advising them on a major component of their finances.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.100]   I'm a financial advisor.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:53.500]   But of course, we usually refer to the term financial advisor as somebody who sells stocks
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.660]   or sells securities.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.020]   That's the technical industry term.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.060]   And if your business card says financial advisor on it, you need to be registered with the
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.300]   SEC and you're going to be registered as somebody who's working in the world of securities.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.540]   So let's zoom in.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.340]   Just because somebody works in the world of selling stocks and bonds doesn't necessarily
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.580]   mean that they give good financial advice.
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.540]   Notice I said they sell stocks and bonds.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.080]   So traditionally, most of us who come in our business cards say financial advisor.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.640]   Most of us, what we do fundamentally is sell stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.680]   That's where we make our money.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.780]   And so traditionally, the industry has often simply used what I'll call financial planning
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.920]   or the delivery of financial plans, which is a good component of financial advice, as
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.160]   a sales tool to sell stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.440]   Now that's all well and good.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.580]   We all need to buy some stocks, bonds, and mutual funds from time to time.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.600]   But now let's home in on the question of financial planning.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   So now there's a major growth and a major emphasis on financial planning as a discipline
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.160]   that's separate and disconnected from financial advice.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.320]   I am an expert financial planner.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.680]   I'm not a portfolio manager.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.920]   I'm not an investment manager.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.200]   I'm not a guru in those areas, but I'm a very good financial planner.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.520]   But now we have a problem that the industry, the CFP board, et cetera, has this concept
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:17.160]   of financial planning that's built around this very traditional US American mainstream
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.560]   go work in a corporate job, save money, put money in a retirement account, allocate your
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.640]   money and retire at 65.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.040]   And so that's what we who come from the industry are taught to do.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.120]   Well, the problem is that those activities are not usually the things that lead to wealth.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   So most of the time, yes, you can save money and put money in a mutual fund.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.400]   And if you wait 40 years, you'll wind up wealthy.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.600]   But most people are drowning in debt.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   And what they actually need is budget coaching.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.480]   And that'll make a bigger difference.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.360]   Or many people, their careers are on, you know, stuck in first gear.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.800]   And if they could get from first gear to fifth gear over the course of a few years and massively
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.040]   increase their income, they would be in a situation where they can make a ton of money.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.000]   And so these are the aspects of financial advice that are very, very important.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.160]   And this is where the industry is struggling, because you can plug many financial plans
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.880]   into a computer and have a computer spit out the proper thing, asset allocation, insurance
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.880]   planning, et cetera.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.360]   That can all be done by a computer.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.000]   But how do you motivate somebody?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.600]   How do you motivate somebody to save money who's not saving money?
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.040]   How do you teach somebody how to earn better?
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.000]   How do you teach somebody their control?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.520]   And so at almost every level, the way that we in the financial services industry try
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.920]   to help people, we're very good if you're rich.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.360]   We're very good at telling you what to do with your money and how to keep it and how
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.760]   to protect it from the tax man and all that stuff.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.000]   We're very good at that.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.920]   But we're not all that good at taking people who are poor and helping them become rich,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.640]   which is kind of what people want.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.920]   And we're not very good at that.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.200]   When you say people who are poor, can you define what you mean by poor?
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.040]   Do you mean in a lot of debt or are they actually poor poor?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.920]   I mean, any of those things.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.640]   You would think that the concept that the financial advisors sell is to say, "Well,
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.720]   you don't have a lot of money."
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.520]   Whether you're very poor or you're drowning in debt, or if you're just kind of normal,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.880]   you don't have a lot of money, we're going to teach you how to have a lot of money.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.320]   But the tool bag that the financial services industry has to solve that problem essentially
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.480]   consists of mutual funds that are put in a Roth IRA, buying some insurance policies,
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.920]   protecting yourself.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.240]   These are very basic tools and none of them really solve the problem of how do you take
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.800]   people who aren't earning a lot of money and help them earn a lot of money?
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.520]   How do you take people who aren't saving money and help them to save money?
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.060]   But my evidence for that is just simply if you looked, if you go and you talk to a room
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.360]   full of financial advisors and you say, "How many of you have a target to work with people
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.080]   who earn six-figure incomes or who have half a million dollars of assets?"
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.160]   The vast majority of people who are financial advisors want to work with people who are
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.080]   earning high incomes or have big businesses or who have a lot of money.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.040]   So the point is that financial advice is very well delivered to people who are wealthy already
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.840]   or who are going to be wealthy based upon things that are done.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.800]   But we're not very good at helping people who are poor.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.460]   Now, before people get all mad at that, I still don't know how to solve that problem.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.780]   But for me, radical personal finance is my effort to say, "Let's try to use media and
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:22.860]   education and try to solve some of those fundamental problems to help people who are poor not be
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.460]   poor anymore so that they can be good clients for professional technical financial advice."
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.700]   That's kind of what I'm trying to do with media.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.700]   Excellent.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.060]   It's a secret plan.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.060]   Shh, don't tell anyone.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.780]   At Rich or Soul, we have a secret plan for wealth.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.860]   It's three steps and it's got a bonus step.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.180]   So step one is live on less than you earn.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.940]   Step two is to save that money that you earn.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.700]   And step three is to make that money that you saved grow.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.540]   And the bonus step is to do your best to stay out of debt.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:02.420]   Now, I know I've asked you this question before, but I'm going to ask you again for our audience.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.460]   It's a real simple plan.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.520]   It's real easy.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.680]   It doesn't matter how much you make.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:16.580]   Everyone could do it and yet hardly anyone does.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.300]   Why?
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.020]   So I don't know that there's a single answer as to why.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.460]   I think we got to attack the problem on a number of different levels.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:35.100]   So a good first example would be many people have lives that are ruined by their own lack
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.820]   of character.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.860]   So what you just laid out as a plan is very simple, but in order to follow it, you have
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.800]   to actually do it.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.700]   In order to actually be able to live on less than you make, you have to know how much you
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.580]   make and you know how much your living costs.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.560]   Well, that's going to require some fundamentals of sitting down with a checkbook and balancing
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.980]   a checkbook or sitting down and making a budget, whether it's as simple as a paper or running
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.900]   a piece of software, et cetera.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.020]   But Rocky, you would have, I mean, I don't know if you believe me or not, but I've had
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.620]   so much trouble with so many people trying to get them to do the fundamentals of finance,
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:13.100]   just the blocking and tackling, the simple things of recording your expenses.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:18.180]   It's remarkable how few people have the personal character and fortitude to actually do something
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.820]   as simple as track their expenses.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.420]   And we talk about that in an earlier episode where the first thing you need to know is
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.660]   where are you?
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.060]   How much money do you have?
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.060]   How much money do you owe?
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.780]   How much stuff of real value do you have?
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.780]   And write that down.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.340]   So here's where we are in the map.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.040]   And then where do you want to go?
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.660]   And then it's a mathematical formula for getting from here to there.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:49.440]   And then the second thing is you've got money coming in every month.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.580]   We all ask that question at the end of the month, where did it all go?
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.540]   To sit down and figure out where did your money go?
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.660]   Nobody likes budgets.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.660]   Nobody likes diets.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.420]   I agree with both of those.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.900]   My diet has bacon and ice cream.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:03.900]   I love it.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.460]   It works for me.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.740]   I don't have a budget, but I know where my money goes and I make sure that it goes where
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.140]   I want it to go.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:19.700]   So we talk about that is you have to know where you're at, where you want to go, and
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:25.500]   are your habits and your actions following what you want your money to do?
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.480]   I think I've heard it said, every dollar should have a job.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.300]   So you need to give your money a job of where it should go and what you should do with it.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.500]   And it's just surprising because this isn't rocket science.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   Right.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.340]   But it's not rocket science, but I don't know the numbers.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:50.220]   I'm just going to say basically that simple formula you just gave, it works every time,
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.380]   but you just wiped out 50% of the population, if not more.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.520]   I'm picking that number up off of a gut instinct, but it's probably more just simply because
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.420]   people don't have the personal character.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.640]   They don't have the personal discipline to do something.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.760]   Now some people are not mentally competent enough to do it.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.480]   Obviously there are people whose mental incompetence is severe and a handicap, but there are some
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.520]   people who just don't have, you know, who are freaked out by a column of numbers and
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   who get scared of it.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.480]   And there are just many people whose personal character is not strong enough to cause them
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   to do that.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   Now I think there are solutions.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.120]   For example, here's an example.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.840]   Generally people are motivated either by pain or pleasure.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   Right.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.520]   So if you have somebody who's in a situation where their personal character is not sufficient
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.080]   to allow them to exercise the simplest of financial disciplines, either something needs
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.760]   to happen to where the pain gets really bad.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.560]   They're kicked out on their ear on the curb because they bounced their check to their
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   landlord once again.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.820]   Landlord said, that's it, you're out.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.440]   And they're going to be embarrassed in front of all their friends.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.920]   And they say, I got to fix this.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.680]   And they start saying, how can I fix it?
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.680]   And they're ready.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   You know what they're looking for.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   They really catch a vision of it.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.160]   Or they catch a vision of, you know what, I want to be financially secure.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.960]   And they say, I'm going to go after it.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.760]   I don't know how that, that transformation process happens.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   I really don't.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.760]   I just know that it does happen for some people.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.600]   And we actually talked about that in two separate episodes on mindset.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.360]   The first one is the stories we tell ourselves, the things inside our head that prevent us
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   from success.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.920]   And then there's that outside influence that also comes upon us that makes us think that
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:32.760]   success is the fancy house or this car or this particular brand of something.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.920]   And that's not necessarily so.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.520]   And we need to make those choices for ourselves.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.000]   You've met a lot of people.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.720]   You've interviewed a lot of people.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.600]   I think you've interviewed people.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.200]   And actually when you worked, you talked to a lot of people, helping them with their financial
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   plan.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   When I worked.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   When you worked.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   When you worked for someone else.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   Is that the right answer?
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   When you worked for someone else.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.280]   When you worked for the man instead of yourself.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.560]   Now it's enjoyable, right?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.000]   You're working for yourself.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.280]   It's love.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:11.760]   So there's got to be certain habits that you've seen that differentiate one group of people
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.880]   from another group of people.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:20.640]   Were there certain habits that you saw certain people had versus other people or mindsets
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.520]   that were different between the groups?
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.320]   Yes, there are.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.760]   And let me cover habits in just a second.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.680]   Go back to kind of reasons because you talked about mindset.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.360]   I know that's a major area of focus for you.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.920]   T. Harv Eker years ago wrote a book called The Millionaire Mind.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.880]   And it was all about kind of the stories that we tell ourselves with money.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.840]   It's a decent book.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:48.200]   For people who have had a lot of questions or who didn't have good examples from their
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.840]   parents about money, I think they would benefit the most from it and realize some of the stories
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.680]   they tell themselves about money.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.880]   But the big thing that I took away from it was the concept of a financial thermostat.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:05.120]   And Harv's point was to say that each person has a different place where they're comfortable.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.600]   A financial thermostat, a place where they see themselves as comfortable.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.520]   And this has to do with how much money you earn, how much money you have, et cetera.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.040]   There are some people who are comfortable having $7,000 of credit card debt.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   That's their comfort level.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   And if they start to inch above that and they start to have $9,000 or $10,000, they start
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   to get really uncomfortable.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.480]   And they start, "Hey, we got to cut back on our spending and pay things down."
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.000]   Other people have a number of $0 of credit card debt.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.360]   Similar things happened with savings.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.240]   Some people are comfortable as long as they have a positive balance in their checking
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.400]   account or maybe $100 of margin, that's good.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.920]   Other people are not comfortable unless they have $10,000 in their checking account.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.240]   And if they start to dip down below, they get very uncomfortable.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:55.600]   So like a thermostat, where you set the thermostat at a certain point, and if the heat gets hotter
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.740]   than that, then the AC kicks on and cools it down.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.380]   Or if it gets below that, the heat kicks on and picks it up.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.640]   People do that with their money.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.280]   They quickly spend money on things that are silly.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.760]   I'm thinking of a former neighbor of mine, and they came from very humble beginnings.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.040]   They came into an inheritance from a family friend that helped them, and they got an inheritance.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.640]   The first thing they did was go out and buy this fancy riding lawnmower, but not like
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.040]   the cheapish kind that you get at Home Depot, like the John Deere sit-on tractor.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.600]   They went and bought a zero-turn commercial level riding lawnmower, a zero-turn mower
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.800]   like the big commercial guys mow to mow their grass.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   And I'm thinking, "What?
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.760]   Why would anybody spend that much money on a zero-turn riding mower?"
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.920]   But from their background, that was an indulgence.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.840]   The first thing they did when they got money was to go and spend it, and it was to be spent
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   on something that they enjoyed, something that would be fun.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.640]   And their lifestyle was such that having a big fancy lawnmower to mow their grass was
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.240]   important to them, and that made life easier.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.120]   So as soon as they got into money, they quickly got rid of it all.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   And you see this happen all the time.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.480]   And the example that Harvey used in the book, which I think is even better now, I think
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.040]   he used Donald Trump, now our president, Donald Trump.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.080]   And he talked about if some people woke up and they found themselves with a million dollars
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.420]   in the bank, they would be so happy.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.480]   They would just say, "Wow, I've got a million dollars.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   How fantastic."
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.640]   Well, if Donald Trump woke up and saw that he had a million dollars in the bank, he had
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.480]   a net worth of $1 million, would he be happy?
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.700]   The man would freak out, and he would say, "What happened to all my money?"
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.240]   And he would immediately go and start doing more deals.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.780]   But he wouldn't go and get a job.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.720]   He wouldn't go and start a corner shoe store.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.160]   He'd say, "How can I go and borrow a couple hundred million dollars and build something?"
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.560]   That's what he knows how to do, because his thermostat is not set for a million dollars
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   of wealth.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.880]   He wouldn't be happy.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.400]   And so each person has a different number and a different way that they see themselves.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:06.000]   I remember when I was younger, and when we first got married, I had a friend and his
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.480]   wife, and I knew what they made.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   I knew what we made, and I think they made about $30,000 more than we did.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:20.240]   And I thought to myself, "If only I made $30,000 more, life would be awesome.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   We'd be set.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   We'd be kings.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.440]   And I would be thrilled beyond belief."
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:36.080]   A couple years later, that happened, and now we doubled that plus, and the happiness didn't
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   change.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.120]   It never does.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   And that's the thing.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:49.800]   So do people just need to be content where they're at, or do they need to create a place
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.000]   to be content?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   How does that work?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.120]   So the happiness, by the way, happiness doesn't change when you make more money.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.240]   There's good research to show, with some exceptions.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.080]   There's good research to show that once you reach a certain point, and there's debate
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.680]   on the number, but a lot of people think it's about $70,000 a year.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.440]   Once you reach an earning level of about $70,000 a year of household income, beyond that, the
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.840]   happiness is not going to change all that much.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.080]   It is tough.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.840]   If you need new tires and you're worried about, "I can't go and buy new ones.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.160]   I got to go to the used store and get them, and is this going to make it," et cetera,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.460]   there is a major difference between that and $70,000 a year.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.500]   But somebody who's making $70,000 a year has enough where beyond that, their marginal happiness
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.320]   is not going to change a lot.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.680]   The other aspect is that the happiness does change when somebody gets out of a stressful
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   situation.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.240]   For example, they're behind on their bills, bill collectors calling all the time.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.500]   If you can get from that to stability, that will change happiness.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.960]   But going from $70,000 a year to $100,000 a year is not going to make a big difference
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.400]   in somebody's happiness level.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.480]   Well, so I was going to say, let's talk a little bit more about happiness, because that's
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   what we all want, right?
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.280]   We want to be happy, enjoy life, and maybe switch gears a little.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:08.600]   I think earlier you talked about helping someone who's younger go from first gear to fifth
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   gear.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:17.940]   What exactly did you mean by that, and how does somebody go from first gear to fifth
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.960]   gear with their income?
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.940]   Something like first gear to fifth gear with their income would involve a mindset change
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.200]   and will involve changes in personal habits.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.880]   Good friend of mine who works in the trades, and he comes from humble beginnings.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:40.300]   When I was talking with this guy, his dream job was to get a good job, a good steady paycheck,
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.380]   and a good steady paycheck at the local big utility company.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.140]   That was where he wanted to work for, and that was his dream job.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:52.220]   Now, for him, that was, based upon his socioeconomic condition, that was his thinking big.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.140]   It's great.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.460]   He's got a steady income now.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.300]   He's never going to be a millionaire unless he figures out how to live on a very small
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.500]   percentage of that income, because his mindset is built around, "How do I get this steady
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.300]   job where they pay me a guaranteed paycheck?"
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.620]   The way you go from first gear to fifth gear with your income is start to get around different
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.760]   people who have different mindsets.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:20.020]   For me, I've chosen opportunity over so-called security.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.220]   I don't believe that security exists in a world where other people write my paycheck,
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.420]   and so I've chosen opportunity.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:30.240]   For me, that's very important to me, and I have that effect on other people.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.540]   When other people listen to my show or they talk to me in person, I'm always thinking
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.540]   about opportunity.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.300]   I see opportunity everywhere, and so that starts to change how people think.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.100]   It starts to change people's mindset.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.780]   Another thing that you can do is, in any context, it doesn't have to be entrepreneurism.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.260]   It can be within the world of work.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.940]   If you start to feed people with the idea that they can grow and become a different
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.980]   person and they start to pursue that path, they can rise up through the ranks.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.620]   Just yesterday as we were recording this, I was with a friend of mine named Andy Sage,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.700]   and I interviewed him for my show.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:13.500]   Andy Sage started with Lehman Brothers on the ground floor of Lehman Brothers with basically
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:20.540]   an entry-level job, $50 a week, right out of the Army as a young man.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:25.820]   Twenty-five years later, he was president and CEO of Lehman Brothers.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.940]   Now that is unique, and one of the things that's unique about the American context,
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.540]   US-American context, is that we are filled with those stories.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.900]   I can take that story and I can go to somebody who's an employee and I can say, "Look,
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.540]   here's this guy, Andy Sage, who did it, current president of Walmart, CEO of Walmart, started
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.540]   off throwing boxes on a Walmart loading dock when he was in college, and now he's the CEO
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.940]   of Walmart."
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.820]   This is something that's built into the American psyche, and that can help somebody to change.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.460]   Now based upon that, then we teach them, "Well, what will you need to do differently?
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.980]   What kind of person would you need to be in order to command a higher wage?
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980]   What would you need to know?"
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.780]   And we can start the process of education, and that process compounds over time.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:09.940]   So you can move somebody from first gear to second gear and on up by changing their thoughts,
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.620]   changing their behavior, little things at a time.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.700]   It may have to do with how they dress, it may have to do with how they treat people,
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.740]   it may have to do with their education, they may need to learn more, and it's just a
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.800]   continual process of enhancing their value in the marketplace.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.160]   We talk a lot about that in two ways.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.980]   One is the compound interest curve, and just the fact that it takes a while on that long,
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.180]   flat leg before it turns.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.920]   And it's constantly taking those little steps, making little changes.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.100]   You don't have to make a major change in your life, but small, teeny steps over time compound
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.060]   into massive change over time.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.440]   And the other thing we talk about is the analogy of baking a cake.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.320]   If you don't follow the recipe and you do things in the wrong order, and you put the
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.040]   frosting in first and throw some eggs on top and a little flour and bake it, and then take
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.200]   it out and mix it, it's not a very good cake.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.420]   I think one of the hardest things, though, people may find is how do you find the recipe
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.660]   for you, and how do you take those baby steps?
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:22.660]   Do you have anything you could share in how people could figure out for themselves where
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.780]   do I start this whole process, or how do I continue to make it grow?
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.460]   If somebody's interested in financial success, the best thing to do is to find the person
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:38.540]   that they know in their own sphere of social contact, the person that they actually know
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:44.220]   who is more financially successful than they are, and go to that person and ask them, "How
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.220]   did you do it?"
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.940]   Or, "How are you doing it?"
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:52.140]   So this can apply in earnings, this can apply in wealth, this can apply in business.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.140]   If you're in sales and you see somebody else who's selling more than you are, go to them
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.060]   and say, "How are you doing that?
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.100]   What are you doing differently?"
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:05.540]   And the key is by starting within your social contact, you're going to have people who are
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.560]   in similar circumstances to you, where you're going to be able to relate to them in some
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.820]   way or another.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.340]   It's not like me saying, "I'm going to go and talk to Bill Gates.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.060]   I don't know how to reach Bill Gates, and I don't know how to do what Bill Gates did."
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.340]   There's a major problem, I think, that we have an obsession with people who are at the
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.020]   top of the top.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:28.140]   And sometimes they got there by coming into market conditions or something that we cannot
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.140]   repeat.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.200]   So you cannot repeat Bill Gates' wealth.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.180]   You cannot repeat Warren Buffett's investing prowess.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.420]   Those are unique skills.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:42.580]   Now some people you can model them in some ways, but if you're working as an entry-level
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.300]   plumbing apprentice, it's better for you to go to one of the older plumbers who's nearby
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:52.300]   and say, "Listen, how did you go from being an apprentice to being a master plumber?"
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.580]   And then once you're the master plumber, you'll be able to go to the business owner and say,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.220]   "Wait a second, how did you go and do this?"
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.780]   And then if you know of a neighbor down the road from you who's involved in the meatpacking
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.980]   business, "How did you get involved in that?"
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.940]   And going and asking those people for advice.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   And my experience has been successful people love to tell people about how they got successful.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.540]   It's a favorite thing that successful people love to do.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.460]   And I think that's one thing people don't realize, that if you go ask, people will tell
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.460]   you.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.460]   They will share.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.620]   They're more than happy to do that.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.140]   For some reason, and I don't know why, it seems culturally most of us don't do that.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.280]   We don't go ask.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.540]   We don't do that.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.540]   Why?
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   Fear.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.060]   I mean, there are all kinds of reasons.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.420]   And I'll tell you what's even worse from my perspective.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.020]   Having been the successful...
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.260]   Well, to answer the question before I tell you, the reason people don't do it is either
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.620]   they never even thought of it or they're scared to do it.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.900]   They've never had it shown to them.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.740]   They never had it taught to them.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.580]   Maybe they were taught, "Don't talk to strangers."
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.560]   Well, that's, I guess, useful as a parenting technique at some stage, but it's also really
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.580]   damaging as a success technique down the road because the most successful people often find
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.340]   themselves talking to a lot of strangers.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:10.300]   But what's even more remarkable on the flip side, my experience, having been a successful
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.700]   person teaching things to others and also interacting, is I've come to believe that
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.180]   people just don't do anything with the advice that you give them.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.900]   And I actually tell people when I'm giving them advice, "You're not going to do anything
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.980]   with this because people don't do anything with it."
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.100]   It's the most disheartening thing.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.300]   When you know something that's great, you've found the pearl of great price, and you want
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.040]   someone to do it and you want someone to do something, and you get tired of saying the
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.140]   same thing over and over to people who come and ask and don't do anything.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.660]   Yes, go and ask successful people, but if you actually do something with what they say
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:43.740]   and you come back and tell them, "Hey, I did something with what you said," the doors will
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.860]   be blown open for you and you'll have the keys of the kingdom.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:55.580]   So I recently did that, and we're going to share that on an episode in a couple of weeks.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:00.860]   And I'm going to tell you a story of how I went through the final stages of getting this
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:08.740]   podcast done, and a coach that I met who actually got me through those last couple of stages
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.820]   and how I attended an event.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:17.020]   It was Seth Godin, and tickets for Seth Godin's event are 800 bucks.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:22.140]   So people are paying a lot of money to learn from this guy.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.940]   And there was actually a group that you could communicate on for people who attended the
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.940]   event.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.100]   There were probably close to 500 of us there.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:36.740]   And one of the people who was a coach said to the rest of the group, "Hey, I'm willing
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.820]   to help coach five of you.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:45.220]   Whoever responds, you can have my time and I will help you with whatever you want in
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.500]   life."
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.780]   I don't know how many people responded.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.020]   I know I did.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:56.020]   I know someone else did, but I don't think he filled all five of his slots.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.060]   All these people who paid all this money to learn, who were at the top of their game,
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.380]   didn't take that extra step.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:09.500]   And I did take that extra step and I learned and I launched this and I went back to him
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.460]   and said, "Hey, I did it."
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.380]   And before I did it, I said, "Hey, will you be on my podcast?"
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:19.500]   And he said, "Well, let's see what you do first."
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.180]   And I went back and I did it and he goes, "Absolutely."
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.640]   So we're going to have a guest on in a few weeks.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.380]   But that right there, that's the type of stuff that people don't do.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.980]   People offer them the opportunity and they don't take it.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.900]   And then when they do take it, they don't follow up.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.220]   And if they do follow up and actually do what they're told to do, they don't always go back
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.900]   to that person and said, "Hey, I did what you told me to do."
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.380]   And they don't realize that for that person, that was just the first hurdle.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.300]   You break the first hurdle, I'm going to open up the door wide.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.800]   And unfortunately, I don't know why that's not taught more, but that's the kind of soft
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.340]   skills that aren't being taught and aren't being learned and aren't being practiced,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.340]   which is a shame.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.180]   I'll give a very practical example.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:18.580]   When I was just starting right out of school, my senior year of college, in my junior year,
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.020]   I studied abroad the first semester and I came back and I was very confused and I wound
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.500]   up dropping out of school.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   And during that time, I took a job working as this entry level, my title was graphic
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.140]   developer, but that was a glorified name for basically make PowerPoint presentations for
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.460]   the company.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.220]   And it was very entry level, basic job.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:40.060]   I made 30, I don't know, 30 to 35,000, somewhere in the $30,000 range.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:45.260]   But while I was there, I was interacting with people and I've always been an interested
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.260]   learner.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:51.340]   And so the simple thing that I did was I went to, I just interact and try to do a good job
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.340]   at my job.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.860]   First of all, if you're hired to do a job, do your job first.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.020]   That's the good place to start with success.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.460]   But I would talk to people and I would ask my bosses, I would ask them, "What book should
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.460]   I read?"
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.980]   And just simply say, "Hey," they could look at their bookshelves or just ask them, "What
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.980]   books should I read?"
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.980]   I remember one of the founders of the company, name was Bob, Bob Post, and he said, "Here
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.180]   are the five books that made a big difference."
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.340]   I went, I bought the books and I read the books and I told him about it.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.380]   He was blown away that I had actually read the books.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.380]   He couldn't believe it.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.780]   Now, I went on from there and that year, similar interactions with other leaders, the president
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.900]   of the company, the CEOs who were managing, and then one of the executive vice presidents
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.820]   who was in charge of me, similar interaction.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.980]   And later that year, they asked me, "Okay, you want to go back to school?"
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:42.220]   And they wound up giving me extra money, scholarship income to go back to school in exchange for
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:46.020]   thinking about working with them when I came back after out of college.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.700]   They paid me extra money that I didn't have to do any extra work for simply because I
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.620]   had taken an interest in learning.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.540]   More importantly, when I went on from there, when I got out of college, I went back and
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.860]   I worked at that company for a year and I had good relationship with people and I just
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.740]   would be an interested learner, read the books that were on their shelf, talk about them.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.180]   And we're talking very, very minor contact.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.660]   I was a low level employee.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:13.940]   Well, they laid me off a year after I graduated from college, but when I was being laid off,
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.980]   both of the men said, "We'll help you with anything that we can."
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:22.340]   Well, it was two weeks later, I was having lunch with my boss, one of the guys, and he
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.140]   said he was the one who gave me the idea to go into financial services.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.820]   He was the one who helped me with the initial introduction there, still friends with him.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:35.140]   The president of the company went on and I was friends with him for a very long time.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.060]   He helped me with some very valuable connections and interactions.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.860]   And the other gentlemen still have a warm relationship.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.940]   And so it can be as simple as simply observing the books that are on your boss's shelf and
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.660]   reading them and asking him, "Hey, what would you recommend I read?"
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.660]   Very simple, but it resulted in a tremendous amount of personal gain and also financial
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.540]   gain for me.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.900]   I think you're working on writing a book, right?
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.380]   Yeah, I have the outline and I can't seem to get the manuscript done, but yes.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.620]   It takes a long time and a lot of work, doesn't it?
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:14.340]   And for under 20 bucks, you can probably buy a book and learn hours upon hours upon years
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.300]   of work of someone's genius.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.820]   It's probably one of the best investments out there.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.620]   I have a whole big bookshelf over there.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.500]   It's overflowing with books.
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.100]   I've got a stack waiting to be read.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.620]   It's one of the things, unfortunately, people don't do.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:35.220]   If you look at the averages, the average person doesn't read and unfortunately they don't
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.220]   learn beyond college.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:42.580]   And the people who take that small little step have so much more success in life, which
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.740]   is just incredible.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:53.900]   So continuing on, I think in the past, the mantra has always been, "We work till 65,"
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:59.140]   because that magic number is somehow when we're supposed to retire.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:05.780]   And I guess in the US it came out because that's when Social Security started paying
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.900]   out, which of course was when I think back then 80% of the people were already dead.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.740]   So I didn't have to pay too much out, so it was a good number.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:21.580]   And yet you struggle that whole time and when you finally get to 65 and you're finally ready
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:30.900]   to enjoy life, your back hurts and you can't walk and your health isn't the greatest and
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.540]   you don't get to enjoy it so much.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.620]   You've decided to take a different path.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:47.260]   So tell us about how to live life now instead of waiting till some arbitrary number.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:53.540]   We're going through some incredible changes in this country and all over the world.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:46:00.420]   And it's going to be, the coming decades are going to be monumental in terms of the social
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.500]   disruption and the impact, tremendous.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:09.260]   And so the only way that I see to get out ahead of that is to be the one who's leading
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:13.020]   in the change, which is what I've chosen to do and what I'm seeking to have other people
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.060]   to do.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:19.180]   And so yes, the fundamental old-fashioned retirement model is broken.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.620]   Now the secret is that it really never worked.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:27.260]   As you alluded to, Social Security retirement age was set for a time that men at that time
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.000]   had a life expectancy that was shorter than the Social Security age.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.720]   So it was set under different models and different assumptions.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.260]   And it definitely doesn't really work going forward in the future.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.260]   Not that people can't retire.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.700]   You can save millions of dollars and be able to retire at 65.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.820]   It's just simply that for the vast majority of people that won't work because they don't
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.260]   earn enough, they don't save enough.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:52.520]   And all of the social programs, Medicare especially, but also Medicaid and Social Security are
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.180]   fundamentally broken.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:59.100]   They'll be changed and people will think they've been fixed, but they're really broken.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.260]   I think the secret is to get out ahead and build a life that you wouldn't want to retire
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.460]   from.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:08.020]   The reason so many people want to retire and are desperate to retire is they don't like
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.780]   their lives.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:14.940]   And retirement for them is something fancy and different that they think they'll like
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.060]   more.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:24.540]   If you build a life that you don't want to retire from, then everything changes.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.980]   And there are a lot of ways to do that.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:33.380]   Now we have this misconception, this misunderstanding about work, where somehow we think that work
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.500]   is a bad thing or that work is not something that we want to do.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:43.020]   Well, if work is something that's not suited for you, if it's type of work that's not well
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:48.900]   suited for your personality, your skills, your abilities, then yes, it's something you're
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.980]   going to want to get away from.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.540]   But when work is well suited for you and when you're doing something that you care deeply
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.820]   about for reasons that are important to you, then you can build something that you won't
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.180]   want to retire from.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:07.180]   It's very powerful when you start thinking this way because it completely changes your
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.540]   approach to life, where you look for the opportunities, the things that are going to be good fits
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.540]   for you.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.260]   Now along the way, you also want to make sure that you're very financially productive and
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:22.420]   that you're a very good saver and that you set aside a lot of capital because ultimately
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.580]   the ultimate freedom is going to come from when you can take a dollar for a salary if
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:31.140]   you want it, if they take as a token gesture, but at the end of the day, you're not doing
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.920]   what you're doing for a direct salary.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.540]   But this has never been more possible in the history of the world.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.980]   In the past, you lived where you grew up, you did the work that your parents and your
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:48.100]   community did, and the opportunity was much more limited than it is now.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:54.060]   But we live in the best time to be alive in the history of mankind and there is more opportunity
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:59.980]   all around the world for people to look for ways to serve others and to build businesses
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.980]   around serving others.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.100]   That's the fundamental basis of it.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:08.320]   So if you start by building a life that you wouldn't want to retire from, it'll dramatically
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.180]   shift your perspective on retirement.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:20.380]   So we talk about that in our second episode, basically in the fact that you need to understand
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.620]   what your purpose in life is.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:28.100]   You need to know where you're going and how you're going to get there.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:37.700]   And just a quick question of how many people that you've helped with financial advice have
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:43.780]   a life plan and a purpose that they've got written down and they know where they're going
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.180]   and what they want to do and they come to you and say, "Here's where I'm going.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.180]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.260]   Can you help me financially get this in place?"
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.260]   Not many.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.260]   Not many.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.460]   And that's one of the ... And the ones who have it don't really need me.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.460]   So I'll tell you a story.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:05.380]   When I was first working as a financial advisor, the business is a very outward focused business
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.860]   where you got to figure out how do I go and get clients?
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.740]   You got an empty office and no one's sitting there wanting to buy from you, so how do you
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.740]   go get a client?
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.380]   So you spend a lot of time going out and marketing towards other people.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.500]   And that's a very painful process because most people don't want to talk about their
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.860]   money.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:27.780]   One day I go to this networking event in town and it's a bunch of old Palm Beach socialite
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:31.900]   rich people who come together and they host all kinds of Congress people and whatnot.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.520]   I decided it would be fun to go to this luncheon meeting.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.940]   And I sit down and guy next to me says, "What do you do?"
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.340]   And I tell him I'm a financial advisor.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.340]   He says, "Oh, wow."
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.340]   He says, "Awesome."
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.380]   He said, "I'd love to have you take a look at my stuff sometime."
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.520]   You could have knocked me off my chair with a feather.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.380]   No one had ever said to me, "Wow, you're a financial advisor.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.780]   Man, I would love to have you take a look at my stuff."
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.580]   And no one had ever said it to me.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.020]   And I said, "Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.020]   I'd love to."
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.700]   And like, "Here, I got my calendar right here.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.660]   Why don't you come into my office and let's sit down and do it."
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.420]   So the next week he comes into my office and he takes a piece of paper and he slides it
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.980]   across the table to me and he says, "Okay, so I got this much money here.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.420]   I own this financial product here.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.420]   I live here.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.420]   Here's my assets.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.420]   Here's what I'm living on.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.420]   Here's how much money I spend.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.340]   Here are my income sources, et cetera."
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.660]   He's got everything laid out on a simple one page piece of paper.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.260]   And he says, "You see any problems?
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.260]   You see any ways to improve that?"
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.740]   So I start going through my mental checklist and I think about his insurance coverage and
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:34.180]   I look at his investments and I think about his income and I gave him one little suggestion
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.300]   that we talked about for a minute and I basically like, "You're covered.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.340]   Everything that ... You're good to go."
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.740]   Now here's why that's a big deal.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.500]   As a financial advisor, I'm really good at poking holes in people's plans.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.780]   That's what we do professionally.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.140]   It's very rare for you to put a financial plan in front of me that I can't find some
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.220]   way to improve it.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.100]   And yet here was somebody that I couldn't do that with.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:01.060]   And this was the one person who had said, "Hey, I'd love it if you take a look at my
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.340]   stuff."
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.060]   I've never forgotten that lesson.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.300]   It made a big, big impact on me.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.300]   That's impressive.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:14.000]   So it's constantly taking whatever your plan, it doesn't even have to be financial.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.020]   Whatever you want to do and constantly showing it to people and saying, "How can you help
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.620]   me improve this?"
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:26.220]   And when you do that enough times, you eventually are going to have a plan that's bulletproof,
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.180]   that's going to work, and then you go implement it.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:33.860]   You said something, and I've heard it many times, and I'd like to get your opinion on
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.860]   it.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.820]   Why don't people want to talk about money?
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:44.180]   I mean, we go to school, kindergarten to 12th grade, so that we can go to college, so that
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:50.740]   we can get a job, so we can make money, but nobody wants to talk about money.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.740]   Why?
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.620]   So the big reason is most people don't have any.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.380]   And when people don't have any, they don't want to talk about money unless they're complaining
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.380]   about money.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:02.620]   They don't want to talk about money in a positive sense because they don't have any and they're
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:03.620]   embarrassed about it.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.260]   They don't want to tell people how much money they have or they don't have.
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.860]   So most people don't have any money, and so they don't want to talk about what they're
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.860]   embarrassed about.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:15.460]   For the people who do have money, the people who do have money have to be very careful
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.620]   about who they talk about money with.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.820]   So people who have money don't want to talk about money with people who don't have money
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.300]   because they're concerned about two things.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:30.500]   One, the people who don't have money will judge them for having money in a negative
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:36.540]   social light or think less of them, or those people will come and just try to get money
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:40.700]   and ask for money, which is very difficult to know how to say no to friends.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.900]   The only people who like to talk about money are the ones who have money and they're talking
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.380]   to someone else who has money.
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.820]   Then it's really fun and they love to do it.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.900]   That was a little bit too circuitous, wasn't it?
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:54:01.300]   No, but I mean, even if you live in a middle class neighborhood, these people, they have
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.300]   money.
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:08.660]   Now, they may not have a couple million dollars, but they've got some money and yet they still
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:13.340]   don't want to talk about how to better use their money.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.180]   Well, there's also a social heritage in the US American culture.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.100]   It's generally considered impolite to talk about money.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.780]   It's impolite to talk about politics.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.660]   It's impolite to talk about religion.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.580]   Those are three of the big topics that are generally off the table.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:31.140]   I think one of them just got put on the table after this election.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:35.660]   It seems like a lot of people are talking about politics right now.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.340]   So maybe next they'll talk about money.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   Well, maybe so.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.180]   And I think that that is changing and that does change.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.860]   I don't know the full answer for any people.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.740]   I just have learned when I was a financial advisor.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:52.780]   So doing the work that I did is very strange because I would basically walk in.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.500]   I worked based upon what's called in the business called referred lead prospecting, which means
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:01.020]   that if I were sitting down with you, I would work with you and then I would say, "Hey,
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.700]   Rocky, who are some people that you think highly of that you think might enjoy meeting
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.700]   me?"
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.340]   And you would say, "Well, my buddy Tom at work and Joe down the road and Susie, my neighbor.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.340]   She's really good.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.820]   And I don't know if they need anything, but here's their number.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.380]   And yes, you have my permission to call them."
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:18.140]   So I'd call them up and walk into Tom's office and sit down and give about a three minute
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.220]   interruption introduction.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.700]   And then basically we're talking about money.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:28.540]   And what I learned, that's a very unusual skill to develop where 20 minutes after meeting
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.620]   somebody I'm asking him how much money they have and how much money they make.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.860]   Like it takes a little while and you develop some decent bedside manner.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:41.500]   But in the beginning I was very, when people didn't tell me that when people didn't answer
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:45.900]   my questions, I generally thought it was my fault.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:51.900]   But I learned with skill and with experience that generally if somebody didn't want to
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.500]   tell me how much money they made or how much money they had, it was usually because they
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.780]   didn't make much or they didn't have much.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.780]   And it sounds terrible.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.980]   I know I'm being a little bit over generalizing, but that was my experience.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.700]   I always could tell the difference.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:09.100]   If I were speaking with somebody who was wealthy, who'd be like, "Wait a second.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.100]   Hold on a second.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.100]   Let me ask you a few questions."
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.700]   And in the conversation I could get a sense of where things were.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.860]   But if somebody just shut down and didn't want to talk about money, I came to realize
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:21.500]   it was because they were embarrassed about their financial condition.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.860]   They didn't want to talk about money.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:25.860]   That's a shame.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.460]   Which is because those were the people that I could help the most, right?
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.260]   I never solved that answer.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.380]   I don't know how to fix the problem.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:37.460]   Well, we'll keep trying.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:41.680]   One last thing I'd like to explore and then we'll wrap up.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:48.820]   I know you're very big about understanding your worldview, living your worldview.
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:54.060]   I think you've even said you have your financial plans, life plans.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.100]   They're in a notebook.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.580]   They're up on a shelf.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:04.580]   And so when you come to a decision point, you can open up your book and say, "This is
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.660]   the decision.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:12.820]   This is where it fits in with my worldview, life plan, financial plan, and it makes it
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:17.740]   a lot easier to just take that next step."
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.800]   I think you're aware in having that.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:25.380]   Most people don't seem to have that mapped out so well.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:34.740]   If people wanted to learn more about or explore how to put their life in such a simple process
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:42.900]   that if I have a question about what to do, I can go look at my life manual and it makes
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.400]   it much, much easier to make that decision.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:53.060]   What advice would you give people for how to start building that or what resources to
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.580]   learn from to take that next step?
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:59.780]   It may be a bigger question than I think you're asking.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:08.420]   When you use the word worldview, I use that term for a comprehensive understanding of
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:16.900]   life which is driven first and foremost by religious doctrine, how somebody approaches
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:17.900]   their life.
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:22.300]   If you see, for example, that ... Let's use two worldviews.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:28.980]   Let's talk about humanism and I'm a Christian, so I'm not a humanist.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:34.620]   So the primary essence and worldview of humanism would say that personal happiness is the greatest
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.300]   gain in life.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:41.180]   So therefore, under a worldview of humanism, the filter is very simple.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:46.020]   You approach a decision and you say, "Well, what's the greatest happiness?"
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:50.660]   Now if you don't approach that as a ... If that's not your fundamental operating worldview,
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.440]   then you have to look at it differently and you have to say, "What are my personal values
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:58.300]   and how do they actually get ranked?"
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:04.580]   If somebody believes that service is the highest good, then they'll approach things and they'll
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:10.120]   say, "Well, how does this impact my ability to serve or not to serve?"
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:14.000]   Most people are not philosophically self-aware.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.980]   Most people have not tested their own understanding of the world in a comprehensive way and tested
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.460]   it to see, "Does my worldview have strength?"
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:29.220]   Most of us simply operate based upon a program that we've adopted unconsciously from society
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:36.020]   around us based upon the values and actions of people around us.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.320]   So yes, that makes a huge difference.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.000]   Now of course, you can home in a little bit more.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.380]   And so a simple example, worldview can be very big in terms of happiness or service
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.140]   or it can be very simple.
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:54.340]   As a Christian, the Bible teaches that if a man doesn't take care of his own family,
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.740]   then he's worse than an unbeliever.
[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:02.720]   And so that brings to someone like me, a disciple of Jesus, it brings a place where you simply
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.420]   have to say, "Well, I have to take care of my family."
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:13.220]   And so since I know that is one of the highest priorities, I can look at any decision and
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:16.940]   say, "Is this gonna allow me to take care of my family or not to allow me to take care
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.940]   of my family?"
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.140]   I don't have to be a Christian to care for family.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.140]   That's silly.
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.780]   That's a common universal thing, but it will dramatically affect the type of career that
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:25.780]   I would take.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.180]   A simple example, I've always wanted to be a truck driver.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.020]   That to me would be a perfect job.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.100]   I'm not gonna be a truck driver 'cause it would destroy my family.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.460]   I wouldn't go in the military, it would destroy my family among other things.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:40.500]   I'm not gonna go and take a sales job where I'm on the road six days a week and get home
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:45.780]   on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon and leave on Sunday afternoon on an airplane.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.620]   Destroy my family and destroy my life.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:53.420]   So I can wipe away all of these jobs pretty quickly based upon that worldview.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:58.700]   Now bringing it down further to a financial plan, a simple thing like identifying, "Am
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:04.500]   I somebody who is seeking security or am I somebody who's seeking opportunity?"
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:09.340]   So for me, I'm seeking opportunity, not security.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.900]   So therefore when I approach something, I'm gonna ask myself, "Is this something that's
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.900]   trying to...
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:17.820]   Am I choosing this because it's secure or am I choosing this because it has opportunity?"
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.100]   I'll walk away from something that's secure as long as it has opportunity.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:27.380]   Now I won't do that if it's going to cause me to not be able to fulfill my obligations
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.100]   to care and provide for my family.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:35.140]   I'll take a job that has security if that's the way that I can provide for my family to
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.660]   make sure that they're well taken care of and I'll walk away from opportunity because
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.000]   caring for my family is a higher value.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.440]   But if I can care for my family in a world of opportunity, I'll choose that.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:53.580]   So from the big to the little, the way that we approach life, if we can become philosophically
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:59.760]   self-aware and understand why we believe what we believe, then we can start to look and
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.840]   say, "Here's how I approach things."
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.700]   I don't think that's as simple as having a manual on the shelf.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.040]   I mean, I have goals, I have plans, things like that.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.200]   I think it's more of a thought process.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.320]   And I'll give you two examples.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.400]   Years ago, I read about the impact and the importance of business plans.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.600]   I forget the source, so I can't cite it.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:25.100]   But they were saying that the much higher percentage of businesses who have business
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:30.640]   plans succeed versus businesses who don't start with business plans.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.040]   And so they were researching this topic and they asked the business owners, "How many
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.900]   times in the last year of your startup have you gone and looked at the business plan?"
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.620]   And the business owner said, "We haven't actually looked at that since we made it."
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.860]   And what they found was that the business owners would make the business plan, but then
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.940]   they just toss it in a drawer and they'd never go back and look at it.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:55.200]   But yet the people who had gone through the mental exercise of creating the business plan
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.500]   were much more successful than those who hadn't, even if they didn't look at the plan every
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:04.300]   day because they were aware of why the business existed and what their goals were for it.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.300]   Same thing with the military.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:09.060]   There's a saying, "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:15.500]   So why does the military still, when a military strategist or tactician is sitting down and
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.060]   saying, "What's our battle plan?"
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.140]   They're sitting down and making seven possible battle plans, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, all the
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   way down.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.100]   Well, they know that it's not going to survive the contact with the situation, but it's the
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:31.020]   diligent process of thinking and considering if this, then that, if this, then that.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.660]   And that's what you and I as individuals can apply to our lives.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.460]   So from the big to the little, what's the ultimate meaning of life?
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:42.300]   Question that men have struggled with for a long time, down to what do I do tomorrow?
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:47.300]   What I do tomorrow is going to be driven by my worldview and by my goals.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:53.100]   And so becoming as self-aware as possible will go a long way towards having that answer.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.700]   And that's a perfect answer.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.340]   I think that's exactly what I was looking for, is people need to know where they're
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:05.340]   going, what they want, and then it just becomes so much easier to achieve it because you've
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:11.580]   actually thought through and you don't end up at 50 years old going, "How did I get here?
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.940]   And this isn't what I dreamed of."
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.060]   And I think for too many people, that's what happens.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:21.260]   But if you sit down and you think it through, and that takes time, you figure out what you
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.620]   want and what you need, and then you start plotting that out.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.900]   Everyone has the opportunity to do great things and live the life that they choose.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:36.340]   And that's kind of what this journey here is on this podcast, is helping people become
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.480]   enlightenment and taking those steps forward.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.780]   So last question, is there something else that I should have asked you that you'd like
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.780]   to share?
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.700]   Is there just something that you would like to share as we wrap up that we haven't chatted
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:50.700]   about?
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.840]   Probably my closing thoughts would simply be this.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:05:06.900]   Human beings are the most remarkable creatures because there's no other creature that can
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.020]   create out of nothing.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:15.060]   So the Bible teaches that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:20.340]   And there's an important doctrine that says that God creates ex nihilo, which means out
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:26.540]   of nothing, from nothing to something, which is remarkable in and of itself.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:31.340]   Now human beings are made in the image of God.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:36.940]   One of the most important aspects of that to me is that we are creators.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:40.920]   We are unique among all of the creatures.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:46.620]   There is no animal who can visualize something abstract in their head and then go out and
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.420]   make it.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.220]   Animals are driven by instinct.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:52.100]   Animals are driven by their genetic code.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:58.020]   Animals are driven to do what all of their forefathers have done before them.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.460]   Now there may be minor variations over time, but pretty much animals do what their parents
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.460]   did.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.780]   But humans are not that way.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:09.860]   Humans can see something that someone else is doing and can do it differently.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:15.080]   And that's why in the history of mankind, you have a son or a daughter who comes from
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.660]   a drunk parent and says, "I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.980]   I'm going to choose differently."
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:25.620]   You have people who come and they look at the examples of other people that are negative
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.860]   and they say, "I'm not going that way."
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:33.180]   And they look at the examples of people who are positive and say, "I'm going that way."
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:41.800]   And there is nothing, nothing that requires that a human being can't do that.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.780]   So yes, we may have certain predispositions.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.140]   I may be genetically different from you.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:55.620]   I may be very apt to be like my parents, but at any point in time, I have the ability to
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.160]   choose.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.820]   And so when you come to finance, when you come to lifestyle, when you come to life design,
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:06.740]   it's important to recognize that we are not the victims of our circumstances.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.540]   We can choose no matter the case.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.540]   Tremendous book.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:15.140]   Dr. Frankel wrote a book, "Man's Search for Meaning," and he talked about the experience
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:22.380]   of he was a tremendously renowned doctor, a psychologist, and then he was put in a concentration
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.980]   camp, a Jewish concentration camp as a prisoner during World War II.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:32.180]   And he was observing the fellow prisoners and studying them psychologically.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:35.260]   And his conclusions were just amazing.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:40.460]   Now I can't summarize the whole book, but the meaning that I took away from it is that
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:45.220]   we have the ability to choose no matter our circumstances, and we have the ability to
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:51.540]   create, to create from nothing in the sense that not that we can start without matter.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.740]   We've got to use God's matter to build our projects.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:08:00.620]   We can't create ex nihilo, but we can look and see something that hasn't been done.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.940]   Artists in their mind, they see something that haven't been done.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.920]   Some people build art with a paintbrush.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.980]   Some people build art with business, and for them it's their art.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.260]   And some people just simply build art or create things differently in their life.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:17.760]   It's the most powerful ability that we as humans have.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.860]   And it's important not to disregard that ability.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.740]   It's important to pay attention and to take full advantage of it while we're here on the
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.740]   earth.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.780]   I think that's an excellent way to close.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:35.240]   Life is not what happens to you, but how you choose to react to it and what you choose
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.520]   to do going forward.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.040]   And that's a perfect way to take that next step on the journey.

[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   do?
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:50.800]   What a radically different idea.
