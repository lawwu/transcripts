[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   Every time you have a meal, the teeth demineralize, and then the biome that sits on the biofilm
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.640]   brings in calcium, phosphate, other minerals from the saliva.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.340]   Again, that's a bank too.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.140]   And it pulls it past that thin film, the biofilm.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.440]   And again, if it's dysbiotic and too thick and you haven't been brushing or you've been
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.520]   feeding it with carbohydrates, that biofilm becomes dysfunctional.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.280]   It doesn't remineralize as well.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.380]   But that's what that little layer does on that inanimate object.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.660]   It keeps the calcium from getting pulled out.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.760]   And if it is, it puts it back in.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.440]   That's that demineralization, remineralization cycle.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.260]   Again, 15, 20 years ago, it was like you had a hole in the tooth.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.680]   That was it.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.040]   You're done.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.580]   Get a filling.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.020]   But now we understand it's dynamic.
