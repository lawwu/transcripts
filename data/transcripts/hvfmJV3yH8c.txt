[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the fourth chapter, reading the first three verses.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.560]   The first three verses in the fourth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:27.720]   I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.200]   ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:45.160]   in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.400]   We began our consideration of this statement last Sunday morning.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.360]   And there I was indicating that clearly here we are starting a new section of this mighty
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.920]   epistle.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.080]   We have finished with the doctrinal section.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   The section exclusively diverted to doctrine, and now we have come to the realm of practical
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.800]   application.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.280]   And we spent our time in showing that there were certain immediate and preliminary lessons
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.720]   that one could gather from that fact alone.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.200]   The first obvious thing is that we must always follow the scriptures.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.160]   We must not pick and choose.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.760]   You do not stop the epistle to the Ephesians at the end of chapter three.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.000]   You must go right on to the end.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.280]   We must read the whole Bible, every part of it, every portion.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.820]   It is all God's Word, and nothing is more dangerous than to be selective in our reading
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.580]   and our study.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.120]   The second thing, obviously, was that, after all, we are called to live a certain type
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.560]   of life.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.480]   Christianity is not merely a matter of doctrine.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.520]   It is not merely a matter of experience.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   It is both those, and we must put them at the very beginning.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   But it does not stop at that.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.720]   It is a life which we have to live, what is called here a walk.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.360]   It is a way of life.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.020]   The Christians were first called the people of the way.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.640]   It is a conversation, as the apostle Peter describes it in that section that we have
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   read just now.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.400]   Well, then, the third thing was, of course, that the apostle indicates here by this word
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   "therefore."
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.320]   Indeed, we spent our whole time last Sunday morning in just drawing up the various things
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.000]   that the word "therefore" says to us.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.240]   The third thing was that this life which we are to live is one which is a deduction that
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.600]   we draw from the doctrine.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.920]   Now that is the New Testament teaching concerning sanctification.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.440]   Sanctification is not so much something that you receive as a gift subsequent to your salvation.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.540]   It is the outworking of the salvation that you have received in terms of the understanding
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.840]   of the doctrine that you hold.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.480]   "I therefore, the prisoner of the law, beseech you."
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   So the way of sanctification is, first and foremost, to take a firm hold of the doctrine.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.240]   There can be no true sanctification without an understanding of doctrine.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   It is the outworking of the doctrine that we have received.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.560]   It is so to see it and so to know it that we shall be filled with such a love to God
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.000]   and a desire to please him that all the commands and instructions and injunctions will not
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.920]   be hard and will give us no impression of narrowness.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.560]   We shall delight in them because of the truth that we have apprehended.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   Very well, we take up at that very point.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.740]   And the next thing which we clearly must look at is this.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.000]   What is the character of this life which we are to live?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640]   We are called to live it.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.400]   We deduce it from the doctrine.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.440]   Well, what is its character?
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.800]   What is its nature?
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.200]   Now you notice that the apostle first of all gives us a general description of it, and
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   then he proceeds to deal with it more in particular respects and in detail.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.080]   For instance, let me show you.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.680]   The general character of the life is this, that it is to be worthy of the vocation wherewith
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   we are called.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.480]   That is its general character.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.200]   Then having laid down the general character, he comes to one particular respect.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   For instance, that we are to endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.560]   We do that with lowliness and meekness and so on.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.520]   He goes on with that until the end of verse 16.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.000]   Then he takes up another respect in which this general character of the life is to be
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   lived.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.080]   He goes on, therefore, and testifies in the Lord that he henceforth walks not as other
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.840]   Gentiles walk, but in this other way.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.040]   So that is the analysis of his method.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.320]   General description first, then particular.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.680]   I must just take a moment to emphasize that.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.200]   That again is something that this apostle always does.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.520]   He never goes to particulars without first laying down the general.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.200]   There is indeed a theme there for many servants.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.960]   I must resist that, but let me put it to you like this.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.840]   It seems to me that most people get into trouble in their Christian lives because they rush
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.240]   to particulars.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.480]   What about this, they say?
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.520]   Now, the answer to that is, go back and find the general principle.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.640]   You will never understand details except in the light of the whole.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.040]   The whole is greater than the parts, and you will never understand the parts except in
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.920]   the light of the whole.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.120]   One man wants to know what is the answer to this, peace or war.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.640]   Another man wants, how can I overcome this?
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.960]   They never really face the whole truth, their whole position, and that is why they go wrong.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.840]   Now the apostle is very careful to start with the general, and it is only after he has made
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.080]   that clear that he comes down to the realm of the particular and the detail.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.000]   Well, very well, we start therefore this morning in looking at this general description that
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   he gives of the character of this Christian life.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And here it is.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.360]   "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.080]   ye are called."
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.720]   If we only know what that means, most of our problems are immediately solved.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.240]   Very well, what does he mean by it?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.200]   Well, let me give you another translation, and a better one.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.480]   That he walk worthy of the calling with which ye are called.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.300]   Vocation, of course, in a sense means calling, but it has by now a slightly different meaning
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.800]   which can lead us astray, and actually the apostle did write the calling with which you
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.640]   are called.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.040]   Now almost every word here is of very great importance and significance, and we must look
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.000]   at them one by one.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.680]   The first word, of course, is the word worthy.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:50.560]   "I beseech you that ye walk worthy of the calling wherewith or whereby or into which
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.960]   you have been called."
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.680]   What does this word worthy mean?
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.320]   Well, the learned authorities tell us that it has two basic ideas in it, and certainly
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.460]   they're both very important.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.920]   The first idea is this.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:14.180]   It's the idea of equal weight, balancing.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:20.020]   That two things should be of the same weight, so that when you put one on one side of the
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.300]   scale and the other on the other, there's no tilting to one side or the other.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.540]   They're just balancing happily and comfortably.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.560]   The weight on the one side is equal almost exactly to the weight on the other side.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.460]   It's a question of equal weight.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:42.100]   Now that's the origin, the derivation of the word that is translated here as worthy, and
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.500]   what a significant meaning it therefore gives to it.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.740]   You see what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:54.740]   "I am beseeching you," he says, "I am admonishing you that you must always give equal weight
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:01.020]   in your life to doctrine and practice."
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.540]   Not all the weight on doctrine and none on practice, not all the weight on practice and
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.420]   just a little, if any at all, on doctrine.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.980]   No, no, that's imbalanced, that's lopsided.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.340]   No, the thing to do is just to see the scales perfectly balanced.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.620]   I don't stay with this because we spent some time with it last Sunday morning, but we must
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.420]   never forget this, we must never ignore it.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.020]   It doesn't matter, my dear friend, how packed your head may be with knowledge, if you're
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.700]   failing in your life, you'll be a hindrance to the spreading of the kingdom.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.060]   You'll bring the cause of God and of his Christ into disrepute.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.980]   But equally it is true to say that if your conception of the Christian life is that you
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.140]   just live a good life and that you're moral and that you can't give a reason for the hope
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.180]   that is in you, and you know no doctrine, again you will be a hindrance to the cause.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.500]   No, no, let there be an equal weight, let it be worthy.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.340]   Only let it be worthy of this vocation wherewith we are called.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.740]   Now the Bible is full of this kind of argument.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.860]   There's a very fine statement of this selfsame point in the sixth chapter of the epistle
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.660]   to the Hebrews, where he puts it like this.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.140]   "Here were people in trouble, you see," and he says, "but, beloved, we are persuaded
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.900]   better things of you and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:38.780]   For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have shewed
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:44.420]   toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.900]   These Hebrews were very good on the practical side.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.180]   They'd been very kind to the saints and to the ministers, and they'd been ministering
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.180]   to their ones.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:11:00.780]   He praises them, but now he says, "And we desire that every one of you do show the same
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:06.580]   diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end."
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.580]   What he's saying is this.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.020]   You've been showing marvelous diligence on the practical side, now then put the same
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:19.380]   diligence into this question of grasping the doctrine and the faith, and having the full
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.060]   assurance of hope on the other side.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.420]   Equal weight, balance it up.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.220]   Don't be all on one side or the other.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.860]   Keep the balance perfect.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.900]   That's precisely what the apostle is appealing here to the Ephesians to put into practice.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:41.140]   Well, now, that's one idea, but let us look at the other.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:49.060]   The other idea in this word is the idea of something that is becoming.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:57.980]   Now, it's interesting how, when these translations were made, how the men responsible translate
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.780]   the same word in different ways and use different translations at different points.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.180]   They might very well have translated this like this, "I, therefore, the prisoner of
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:15.140]   the Lord, beseech you that you walk in a manner which is becoming of the calling wherewith
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.140]   you are called."
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:22.220]   Now, this same apostle, you see, has said a similar thing in writing to the Philippians,
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.780]   and there they translate it like this.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:32.540]   He talks about himself being in prison and suffering and how they likewise were called
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.780]   to suffer, and to you it is given on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:43.060]   also to suffer for his namesake, and here's his appeal, "Whatever happens to you, only
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:51.740]   let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.340]   It's exactly the same idea.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.500]   Well, now, what is it?
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.420]   Well, here you see the idea is of matching.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:06.860]   It's of putting on a piece of clothing, something that is consistent with, something that is
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.620]   suited to, something that is becoming.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.700]   He means, if you like, negatively, that we must always avoid a clash.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.860]   There must never be a clash between our doctrine and our practice.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.500]   Now, this is important in the matter of dress, isn't it?
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.860]   You must never have a clash of colors.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.860]   It isn't becoming.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.820]   There are certain colors that don't match, they don't go together, and when you see a
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.460]   person with these clashing, contrasting colors, well, there's something incongruous about
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.220]   it, and you say that person's lacking in taste, it calls attention in the wrong way.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.740]   No, no, it must always be becoming, and of course you can extend the idea.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.900]   The same clothing isn't always becoming at the same age.
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.320]   There's nothing quite so ridiculous as to see an oldish person dressing as if he or
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.300]   she were young, and vice versa.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.500]   There are certain things that are becoming.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:08.220]   Now, that's the idea that the apostle has got a hold of here, that there must never
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.580]   be this element of incongruity.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.140]   There must never be none of these sharp contrasts.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.820]   Of course, I know that there is a kind of perverted modern art that delights in that
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.700]   sort of thing.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.140]   You get it not only in art, but in music.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.220]   People who despise melody and who think that there's nothing wonderful except some cacophony
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:34.060]   and clashes and discords, but that's modern perversion.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.060]   That's not art.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:42.980]   No, no, real art always has beauty because it always has at its center the idea of balance
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.980]   and of congruity.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.500]   There's no beauty apart from that.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.340]   Now, this isn't a theory.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.940]   This is something that has been universally held throughout the ages.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.420]   Let us beware of these perversions.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:59.260]   Now, the apostle is using this kind of picture.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:09.100]   "Let you walk," he says, "be as becometh the calling wherewith you are called."
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.980]   Now, let me take up another word that the apostle used.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.700]   He's got a phrase like this in writing to Titus along the same lines.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:25.500]   He talks about adorning the doctrine.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.200]   And here again the same idea comes out.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.740]   The picture, if I may so put it, is this.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:38.780]   The doctrine is, as it were, the foundation garment, the kind of fundamental garment.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.780]   Then what is the life?
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.500]   Well, it's the adorning that you add to the foundation garment.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.420]   There must be some basis, some foundation, something to build upon.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.020]   Well, then you add to that.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:56.660]   And you must always be careful that your decorations, that your adornments, are suited to and are
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.860]   congruous with and match this foundation garment that you've already put on.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.140]   The doctrine is the foundation.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.980]   The life is the adorning.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.620]   And of course, the purpose of the adorning is to make it attractive, to make the doctrine
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:16.500]   attractive, to cause people to admire it, to look at it and say, "Isn't that wonderful?
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.020]   I'd like that, and I'd like to look like that."
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:25.900]   Now, that's exactly the way in which the apostle so frequently introduces this appeal
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:33.260]   for conduct in terms of the doctrine that he has already outlined.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.420]   Now then, let me put it in this form.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:44.980]   The apostle you see here, as everywhere else, does not merely issue a general appeal to
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:51.420]   Christian people to be good or to live a good life or to be philanthropic or something like
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.420]   that.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.420]   Never.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:17:00.580]   The appeal is always in terms of the doctrine.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.380]   It must always come out of it.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.540]   It must always match it.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:13.820]   And therefore, you and I are to live the kind of life that will adorn the doctrine.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.820]   What is the doctrine?
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.740]   Well, he proceeds at once to tell us.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:29.580]   The doctrine is this, the vocation, the calling wherewith we are called.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:35.860]   We are to be worthy of the calling to which we have been called.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:42.700]   Now once more, we are dealing with a phrase that is very typical and characteristic of
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.140]   the New Testament.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:54.180]   And as it is one of these so constantly repeated phrases, it is again important that we should
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.900]   grasp its terms without any question or without any misunderstanding.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.900]   What is the doctrine?
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.780]   It is this.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:13.020]   We are to live this kind of life for this reason, that we are the called, worthy of
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.740]   the calling wherewith you have been called.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:27.460]   Now this is the characteristic way in which the New Testament always describes Christians.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.980]   Christian people are the called of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.980]   What is a church?
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:40.180]   Well, a church, the church is nothing but a gathering of the called, the very term in
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.900]   Greek for it is ecclesia, which means the called out ones.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.100]   Now the apostle you see has just been talking about that at the end of the previous chapter.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.460]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:19:00.260]   according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church amongst the
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.460]   called ones, amongst the called out ones.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.060]   Christians are people who have been called out of the world, out of darkness, into his
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.600]   most marvelous light.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:19.060]   Now then, here is obviously something that is very vital.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:26.520]   The Christian must never be thought of as someone who has decided to take up a certain
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.360]   type of life.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.960]   Christianity, the Christian life, must never be thought of in terms of something that we
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.000]   have decided to take up.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It is the exact opposite.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.120]   It is something into which we have been called.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.280]   That is why I say it is unfortunate that this has been translated as vocation.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.720]   And yet you see it is a departure from the original meaning even of that.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.680]   But we talk about a man taking up a vocation.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.600]   No, no, you don't take up a true vocation.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.800]   It is something to which you have been called.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.600]   And that is why we must hold on to this word "calling".
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.440]   So the apostle says that the way in which we live the Christian life is, first of all,
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.040]   always to remember that we have been called to this.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.440]   Called from, called to.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.880]   And this is the thing to which we have been called.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.840]   Well now, he has already, of course, been dealing with this.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.760]   Way back in the first chapter he put it like this.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.240]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:45.680]   spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.840]   him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:57.080]   him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.240]   himself according to the good pleasure of his will."
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.880]   And then he reminded them of it in the second chapter, "you which he quickened who were
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.080]   dead in trespasses and sins" and so on.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.560]   There it is.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:18.000]   But now, once more, you see, he comes back to it.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.640]   And he emphasizes it anew and afresh.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.520]   And the point, therefore, I am concerned to make this morning is this, that this is the
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.040]   greatest motive of all to sanctification.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.240]   The reason why we are to live a holy and a sanctified life is that we are the called
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.280]   ones.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.800]   Not merely because it is a good thing not to sin and to live the Christian life.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.640]   Not because these things are good in and of themselves.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.640]   Not at all.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.960]   Primarily because we have been called to this.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:58.000]   Now that means that we must look again at this whole idea of the calling.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.080]   The calling wherewith you have been called.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.960]   What does the Bible tell us about this calling?
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.040]   Well, its teaching is perfectly plain.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.640]   There are two types of call.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.040]   The first is a general call.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.360]   And the general call is made to everybody.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.320]   God commandeth all men everywhere to repent.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.480]   There is a universal call going out from the church to the whole world today to repent
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.760]   and to believe the gospel.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.400]   That is a message that is addressed to every person.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.680]   Repent, believe the gospel.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.720]   It is a universal call.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:54.680]   Now the word call is used in that sense in the scripture.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.240]   But clearly that is not its only meaning.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.800]   Because you find it used in another way in which it is much more particular.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.640]   So that my second heading is this, that in addition to the general call there is what
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.000]   has always been called the effectual call.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.640]   You see this call to repent and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is made to all, but
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.320]   all do not respond to it.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.560]   There are only some who are Christians, there are only some who are in the church.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.720]   There is a difference between these and those.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.280]   They have all received the general call.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.280]   What is this difference?
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.560]   Well, the answer is that the believers, the Christians, are those to whom the call has
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.880]   come effectually.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.440]   The effectual call.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:50.240]   Now let me give you some examples and illustrations to show you what I mean.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:58.800]   Take what this apostle Paul says to the Corinthians in the first epistle and in the first chapter
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.240]   and in the eighteenth verse.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:11.200]   He says there, "You remember that the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.880]   Not unto us which are saved, he says.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.520]   It is the power of God."
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.080]   There are two groups of people.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   There are people to whom the preaching of the cross is foolishness.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.720]   There are people to whom it is the wisdom of God.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.400]   And there he starts with his fundamental distinction.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.800]   There are the perishing, there are the saved.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.120]   Well, does he describe them in other terms?
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   Yes, he does.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   Listen to this, in verses 23 and 24.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.360]   He says, "The Jews require a sign, the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.840]   Unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness, but unto them which
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:04.000]   are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.440]   So you see, the contrast is this.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.080]   The perishing and the saved, the Jews and the Greeks to which it is a stumbling block
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.320]   and a foolishness, and those who are called.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.480]   The called are the same as the saved.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:31.080]   And that is the characteristic New Testament employment of this particular term and category.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:40.680]   The Christians, the saved, the believers, are always described as the called ones.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.400]   These who have been separated from the others, and they have been called from there to here,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:53.040]   and they are the called unto us which are called, Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.920]   of God.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.140]   One other thing is of importance, and that is that we must notice the point at which
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:05.200]   the calling comes in this question of salvation.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.800]   And the answer is that calling comes before justification.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:17.560]   Listen to the apostle putting it in Romans 8.30, "Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:29.260]   them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified,
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.420]   them he also glorified."
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:43.460]   Predestination, calling, justification, ultimately glorification.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.860]   Now then, what does this mean?
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   Well, it means this, you see.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:56.200]   It is that mighty action of the Spirit of God in the soul and upon it, whereby the Holy
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.740]   Spirit introduces a new principle of life and of action.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.740]   And it is this principle of life and of action that enables us to believe.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.080]   We are called to believe.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.800]   Now take the way in which the Lord Jesus Christ himself put it.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:32.840]   You have got it in John 6, verse 44, "No man can come unto me, except the Father which
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.720]   hath sent me draw him."
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.120]   The call is the thing that draws him.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.880]   There is power in the call and it draws him.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.720]   He cannot come without it.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.840]   Or take the way in which we are given an account of the first convert, in a sense, in Europe.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.880]   There is the apostle Paul preaching to the little prayer meeting of women outside the
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.640]   city walls in Philippi on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.400]   And there he spake unto them the word of the Lord.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.240]   And there was a woman named Lydia, a cellar of purple from the city of Thyatira, listening
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:16.520]   to him, whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things that were spoken
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   of Paul.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.760]   That is the call, the opening of the heart, which makes us attend and believe.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.200]   Without it, the word has no effect.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.680]   Now as I was just saying, the apostle has rarely said all this at the beginning of chapter
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   two.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.600]   And he has got all that in his mind as he talks here about the calling wherewith you
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   have called.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   This is the position.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:47.400]   "You hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins."
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.160]   He comes back again and says it again in verse 5.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   "Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us."
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.120]   A dead person cannot quicken himself.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.560]   God alone can quicken.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.760]   And that is how he does it.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:09.680]   There is a wonderful illustration of all this, it seems to me, in the Gospels.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.200]   It is, of course, the case of Lazarus.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:21.360]   Lazarus died and had been dead for four days.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.560]   And his body was in the grave.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.440]   And putrefaction had already started.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.320]   And our Lord arrives on the scene.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.160]   And this is, you remember, what happened.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:46.360]   "Take away the stone," he said, and then spoke, saying, "Lazarus, come forth."
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.520]   And he came forth.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.720]   He called him from the dead back to life.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.840]   And you see, the power was in the call.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.280]   The power was in the word spoken.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.000]   That is what he means by the calling wherewith he was called.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.720]   The word has come effectually with power.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.920]   The Holy Spirit was in it, in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:16.240]   And when the word comes in the power of the Spirit, it calls us from death and the grave
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.320]   spiritually into life and into newness of living.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.480]   Again, listen to Paul putting it in Romans 4, 7.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:29.240]   "God," he says, "who quickneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   they were."
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:41.720]   And so, Abram and Sarah, though they were over ninety years of age, could have a son.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   Impossible naturally, but not with God.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.640]   When God calls, he gives the power.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.160]   And it is effectually certain it must happen.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.800]   And it did happen.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:02.360]   And you and I as Christians are the called.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:09.160]   Out of that death and grave of sin, when we were yet dead in trespasses and sins, the
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.600]   mighty word came and called us and enabled us to hear.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.200]   It put life into us, quickened us.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.160]   Living is the giving of life.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.360]   And you notice how careful Peter is to say all that in that first epistle, portions of
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.840]   which I read at the beginning.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:32.760]   "Born again," he says, "not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.680]   God which liveth and abideth forever, the word of the gospel."
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.480]   It has got the life in it and it comes in the power of the Spirit and the seed is implanted
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:49.320]   and the response is made.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.640]   And did you notice further the argument that Peter used?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.080]   It's an exact parallel to this argument of the Apostle Paul here.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:09.520]   But he says, "As he which hath called you is holy," that's God, "as he which hath called
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:16.280]   you when you were in that grave and called you out of it, as he which hath called you
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.480]   is holy, so be ye holy."
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.680]   In all manner of conversation, but again he says it in the second chapter.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:36.080]   Look here, says the Apostle to these people, there's no need for you to argue or to hesitate
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.040]   about living this Christian life.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.560]   Do you know what you are?
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.320]   Do you know who you are?
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:51.880]   You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   Why?
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.000]   Why has God called you to be such?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.440]   Here's the answer, "That ye may show forth the praises of him who hath called you out
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.160]   of darkness into his most marvelous light."
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.320]   Well now, that's exactly the thing that the Apostle is saying here, that we have been
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.000]   called in order that we may show forth these things.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:26.480]   "Be worthy," he says, "of the vocation, the calling to which you have been called."
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.600]   That's the foundation garment.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.480]   Now then, he says, "Adorn it.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.800]   Live in such a way that you'll set it out.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:43.240]   Make it look yet more wonderful, more glorious, and more attractive."
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.200]   And you do that, I say, by applying the doctrine and the knowledge that you have.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.240]   Very well, I say, this is the way in which you and I have got to live.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:00.880]   We have got to live as those who realize that we have been called by God into this heavenly
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.960]   calling.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:09.880]   Very well, we can only do it then as we know the doctrine.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:20.200]   And all I want to do in a few moments before I close is just to remind you of some of the
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:27.320]   things which must always be in our minds and governing our conduct and our behavior.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:33.120]   We have been called to this great and wondrous and high calling.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.000]   What is it we've got to match?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.840]   Here I am with ribbons of every description and color.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   Which am I to choose?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.240]   What am I to put on this foundation garment?
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:47.160]   Well, here are some of the things.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:53.680]   I am always to remember this, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:03.520]   who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.840]   That's what I find in the third verse of this epistle to the Ephesians at the very
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   beginning.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.800]   My dear friends, every argument and every excuse has already gone, hasn't it?
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.200]   It's no use talking to me about your difficulties.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.640]   I'm not interested in what you've got to say about 1957 and life as it is in London
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:30.080]   today and all the problems and the difficulties.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:36.320]   You have been blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.320]   And there's nothing beyond that.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.840]   Everything you need is at your disposal.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.280]   It's all in Christ and you are in him and he is in you.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.680]   Very well, we must always remember that.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:59.000]   I must live in a way that I shall exemplify that and bring that out and make that manifest.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.560]   And then he reminds me also in the next verse, "According as he hath chosen us in him before
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:11.600]   the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love."
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.240]   What has he called me to?
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.280]   Why has he done all this?
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.020]   Was it merely that I might not go to hell?
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:27.000]   Was it merely that I might know that my sins are forgiven and can then carry on?
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Not at all.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I have not been called only to be forgiven.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:41.120]   He hath chosen me to be holy and to be blameless before him in love.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.600]   And I have no right to argue, nor to question, nor to query.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.160]   That's the thing to which he's called me.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.760]   The next thing he reminds us of is this in the fifth verse, "Having predestinated us
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:03.080]   to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ."
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:10.080]   And we have seen how later he says that we are fellow citizens with the saints and of
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.920]   the household of God.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:20.240]   We've been called into the family of God.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.120]   We are God's children.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:29.160]   And I am to live in a way that will reflect credit and glory upon the family and upon
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.960]   the Father.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   The British are in any foreign country conscious of the fact that the honor of his country
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   is in a sense in his hands.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.520]   The honor of the family is in the hands of the child of the family.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.280]   And if the child doesn't behave as he should, the people won't blame the child.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.320]   They'll blame the parents, and rightly so.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:38:00.520]   The honor of the family is in the child, and you and I are children of God.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:09.240]   So that as I walk the streets of life, I must always remember that I am a child and a member
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:18.440]   of the family, having adopted us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440]   And what else?
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.080]   Well, because I'm a child, I'm an heir, because he reminds these people that they have the
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:30.240]   Holy Spirit, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:36.400]   possession.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.440]   It isn't so much what I am now as what I'm going to be.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:52.120]   I'm not only a child of God, I'm an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.520]   You read about people being groomed for certain things, don't you?
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.960]   About manners and conduct and department and behavior before being presented at court or
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.160]   before taking part in something.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.720]   Quite right.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:17.960]   And there is a day coming in your life and mine when we shall be presented to God.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:24.480]   Now unto him, says Jude, who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.000]   before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   My friend, you and I are to live in a way as realizing that we are going on to that.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And having been presented, we shall be given the reward and enter into the inheritance.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.680]   It's coming, the purchased possession.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:50.840]   We are now receiving firstfruits and foretastes of it, but we are going into it.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:55.240]   And not only that, he's been reminding us that already, you'll find it at the end
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.600]   of the first chapter, we are members of the body of Christ, the church, he says, which
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:08.280]   is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all and in all.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.840]   We are joined to Christ as the members of the body belong to the head.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.360]   We are parts of him, of his flesh and of his bones, he's going to say in chapter 5.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:26.560]   Not only that, you remember, we have been quickened with Christ, we have been raised
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.680]   from death with Christ.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:35.080]   Yes, and we are at this moment seated with Christ in the heavenly places.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.360]   Now, we are there, we are in Christ and where he is, we are.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.720]   We must live, I say, as realizing that we are seated there in the heavenly places even
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.920]   at this very moment.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:41:01.400]   And then we must always remember that Christ dwells in our hearts by faith and that there
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.800]   is something of the fullness of God in us.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.600]   This is sanctification, this is holiness, this is the way to live, to realize that these
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.040]   things are true.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.320]   And then let me add this, the apostle has been making a great deal of it.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.760]   That's what I'm called to.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:28.040]   And then never forget the way in which the calling has taken place.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.560]   What is it that has made it possible for me to come from death to life, from that grave
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.480]   of sin to newness of life and to be seated in the heavenly places with Christ?
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.600]   The answer is this, it's the free grace of God.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.480]   By grace he has saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.360]   We are his workmanship.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.800]   While we were dead and desperate and hopeless and the creatures of lust, he quickened us
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.440]   in spite of it.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:04.320]   And how did he do it all and what made it possible, if I may so phrase it, for God to
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.960]   do it?
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.920]   And you remember the answer, don't you?
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.320]   It is by the blood of Christ.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:22.840]   "Ye that sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ."
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.320]   You remember how Peter puts it?
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.400]   You haven't been redeemed with gold and silver from your vain conversation, he says, but
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:37.240]   by the precious blood of Christ is of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.480]   So that when sin comes and tempts you or when you are doubtful whether you shall go on with
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.000]   the Christian life and whether it's hard and makes too many demands, remember the price
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.240]   that was paid for your deliverance, your ransoming.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:03.320]   Christ gave his life unto death that you might be rescued and that you might become holy.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.040]   And then remember the power that is given to you, the exceeding greatness of his power
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.400]   to us that believe.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:17.760]   Let us remember also that we must be and can be strengthened with might by his Spirit in
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.000]   the inner man.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.760]   There it is.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:25.240]   And finally, I believe he adds this.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:32.040]   Did you notice that the apostle makes this appeal as the prisoner of the Lord?
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   Why that?
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.720]   Well, I think it's just this.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.560]   He says, "You are to live as I am trying to live and as I am living and I am living
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.080]   the life of a prisoner.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.680]   I am actually in prison at the moment and why am I there?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.400]   Well, because I don't decide what I do.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.080]   I am the servant of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.800]   I am his bond slave and it is because I am loyal to him and preaching his gospel that
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.160]   I am in prison.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   But it doesn't worry me.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.040]   I am not in charge.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   He is.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.520]   He has called me and I am his bond slave, his servant.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.560]   I am his prisoner.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.760]   And you and I are to live as the prisoners of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.040]   Ye are not your own.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   Ye have been bought with a price.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.920]   We have no right to live as we choose and as we please.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.520]   We were the prisoners of Satan.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.480]   We are now the prisoners of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.960]   We should have no desire save his.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:44.600]   Let nothing please nor pain me apart, O Lord, from thee.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:59.560]   I beseech you as one who is a prisoner myself, walk in a manner that is worthy of the calling
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.280]   to which you have been called.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:13.960]   Oh, if we but saw this calling, if we but grasped its meaning in all its parts, there
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.280]   would be no problem about Christian living.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:28.400]   We would count it our supreme delight to hear his dictates and obey.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.560]   Amen.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
