[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   - As perhaps the greatest chess player of all time,
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.320]   when you look introspectively at your psychology
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.800]   throughout your career, what was the bigger motivator?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500]   The love of winning or the hatred of losing?
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.080]   - Tough question.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.040]   Have to confess I never heard it before,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   which is again, congratulations,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.400]   it's quite an accomplishment.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.440]   Losing was always painful.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.720]   For me, it was almost like a physical pain
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.380]   because I knew that if I lost the game,
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.800]   it's just because I made a mistake.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.720]   So I always believed that the result of the game
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.200]   had to be decided by the quality of my play.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.580]   Okay, you may say it sounds arrogant,
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.720]   but it helped me to move forward
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.280]   because I always knew that there was room for improvement.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.200]   So it's the-- - Was there the fear
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.160]   of the mistake?
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.880]   - Actually, fear of mistake guarantees mistakes.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.600]   And the difference between top players,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   the very top, is that it's the ability to make a decision
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600]   without predictable consequences.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.760]   You don't know what's happening.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.800]   It's just intuitively, I can go this way or that way.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.880]   And there are always hesitations.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.280]   People are like, you are just at the crossroad.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.440]   You can go right, you can go left, you can go straight.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.960]   You can turn and go back.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.320]   And the consequences are just very uncertain.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.200]   Yes, you have certain ideas what happens on the right
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   or on the left, or just if you go straight,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   but it's not enough to make well-calculated choice.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560]   And when you play chess at the very top,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.920]   it's about your inner strength.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.240]   So I can make this decision.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.060]   I will stand firm, and I'm not going to waste my time
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.900]   because I have full confidence that I will go through.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.320]   Now, going back to your original question is,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.520]   I would say neither.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   It's just, it's love for winning, hate for losing.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800]   They were important elements, psychological elements.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   But the key element, I would say the driving force
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.120]   was always my passion for making a difference.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   It's just, I can move forward, and I can always enjoy
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.880]   not just playing, but creating something new.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.360]   - Creating something new.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.740]   How do you think about that?
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.680]   - It's just finding new ideas in the openings,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.700]   some original plan in the middle game.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.520]   Actually, that helped me to make the transition
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.120]   from the game of chess, where I was on the very top,
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.380]   to another life, where I knew I would not be number one.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.300]   I would not be necessarily on the top,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.940]   but I could still be very active and productive
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.460]   by my ability to make the difference,
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.640]   by influencing people, say,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.160]   joining the democratic movement in Russia,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   or talking to people about human-machine relations.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.000]   There's so many things where I knew my influence
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.940]   may not be as decisive as in chess,
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.260]   but still strong enough to help people
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.840]   to make their choices.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.320]   So you can still create something new
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   that makes a difference in the world outside of chess.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.480]   (silence)
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.640]   (silence)
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.800]   (silence)
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.960]   (silence)
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.120]   (silence)
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.280]   (silence)
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.440]   (silence)
