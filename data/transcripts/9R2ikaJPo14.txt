[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.740]   found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the 8th chapter and reading
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.140]   from verse 26 to verse 31. "And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying,
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.300]   Arise, and go toward the south, and to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.140]   unto Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia,
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.960]   a eunuch of great authority, and of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.260]   the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.020]   returning, and sitting in his chariot, read Isaiah the prophet. Then the Spirit
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.960]   said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip ran
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.700]   thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.120]   what thou readest? And he said, How can I, except some men should guide me? And he
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.660]   desired, Philip, that he would come up and sit with him." And the story goes on to
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.300]   tell us how Philip found that he was reading at a particular place in the
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.420]   book of the prophet Isaiah. Then Philip expanded it and other scriptures to him,
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.260]   and the men, as the result of this exposition, believed the truth. So that
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.900]   the end of the story, as it is given here, is this. And when they were come up out of
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.820]   the water, for he'd asked to be baptized, and Philip had baptized him, when they
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.020]   were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:53.020]   eunuch saw him no more. And he, the eunuch, went on his way, rejoicing. Now this is
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.060]   one of these great New Testament stories. The Bible, amongst other things, has its
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.620]   incomparable stories. And this is one of these great, marvelous, and wonderful
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.220]   stories. It's a story, of course, which shows us the essential nature of the
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.380]   Christian message, of what it does, what it sets out to do, and how it does it. It
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.740]   shows us, therefore, the character of the Christian life, and the effect that
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.620]   becoming Christian has upon any individual, or any group of individuals
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.460]   in the world. And the thing, of course, that strikes us at once is the great
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.580]   and marvelous change that took place in this man's entire circumstances. From
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.180]   being a miserable, and a very unhappy man, he became a man who was filled with a
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.820]   spirit of rejoicing, and went on his way rejoicing. Now this is the great thing
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.380]   that is established by this famous story. It reminds us at once, you see, that the
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.940]   Christian life is something profound, and that when a man becomes a Christian,
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.020]   the truth about him is not simply that he's a little bit better than he was
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.780]   before, or that he's been modified somewhat, or that he's been improved a
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.380]   little, or that he's added something extra onto what he'd got before. It just
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.540]   shows us that those ideas of what it is to be a Christian are totally and
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.820]   completely inadequate. What it does is to change a man completely. And that is why
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.660]   the Bible talks about regeneration, or rebirth, or being created anew. No other
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.020]   term is adequate to describe this great and wonderful change that takes place
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.660]   in a man when he becomes a Christian. Well now, that's the sort of thing that
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.900]   we've got in this story. And thank God we've got it, for we are living in an age
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.920]   when there are strange and curious notions current with regard to what
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.940]   Christianity is, with regard to what it means to be a Christian. Some seem to
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.660]   have the impression that it's mainly a question of backing Britain. At least
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.700]   they seem to be preaching on that theme today, as if that were Christianity. But
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.980]   here, you see, we are given the true, the genuine, and the real thing. And thank God,
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:34.260]   I say, that we have such records which we can consider together. And we ought to
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.580]   thank God that he ever caused his servant, Luke, to write this book, and to
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.540]   give us details such as this. Has it ever occurred to you to ask that question? Why
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.520]   have you got a story like this? Why do they take the trouble to enter into all
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.760]   these details? Well, you see, this is the wisdom of God. There were misunderstandings
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.840]   current at the very beginning with regard to Christianity, and they've
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   increased since then. So God not merely gives us the truth in the form of
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.040]   doctrine or of teaching, he gives us these examples and practical
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.440]   illustrations, so that we are left without any excuse at all. We are given
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.240]   the story of how it happened to one particular man like this. You see, the
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.880]   Bible doesn't just say that if a man believes in Christ, he becomes a
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.680]   Christian. We know from practice and from experience that there are difficulties
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.360]   and obstacles and many things that trouble us. Well, thank God, here we are
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.120]   given a case like this, and we can follow it and follow it from step to step, and
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.240]   stage to stage, and discover exactly what it is. Now, here, I say, we are dealing
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.040]   with one particular case. And it is right that we should do so. But remember, all
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.800]   cases are not identical. What I mean by that is this. There are different types
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.920]   of persons, and they become Christians in detail, in different ways, different types
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.960]   of temperament, different backgrounds, different abilities. There are these
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   extraordinary differences. But, and this is the thing I really want to emphasize,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.760]   in the great essential centralities, they're all the same. I'm simply making
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.200]   this point for this reason, that I've known people to be in trouble sometimes
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.080]   with regard to these matters, because they haven't had exactly the experience
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.760]   of somebody else whom they knew. I once knew a Christian father who was a real
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.520]   hindrance to his own son, because he wasn't satisfied that his son was a
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.440]   Christian at all, because his son hadn't had in detail the experience he'd had. And
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.840]   he said to me on one occasion, when I was talking to him, to try to get him to
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.040]   cease hindering his own son, he said, "You know, he hasn't had the Damascus Road
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.480]   experience." I said, "Why should he have it?" I said, "That's not the test. We are not
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.800]   concerned so much as to how a man becomes a Christian as to whether he is a
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.760]   Christian. That's the question." And so you will find that while there are these
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.240]   particular differences in the details of how it happens to a man, how it comes to
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.960]   him, there are certain things that are absolutes, and are always present, and
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.400]   those are the things that rarely matter for us. Nevertheless, it is interesting
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   to observe these differences, because as you do so, you will find that you in
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.320]   particular are helped by one rather than by another. And that is why God has
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.240]   provided these different types for us, in order that somewhere or another, and
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   somewhere or another, taking them all together, we are all covered, and we are
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.280]   all helped even in connection with the details. So I'm calling attention to this
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:58.160]   for these great reasons, that we may examine ourselves in the light of this,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:07.680]   that we may know exactly whether the essentials are true of us. Not so much
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.080]   the details as the great essentials. These things are written for our
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.000]   instruction. We need to examine ourselves. Every man who thinks he's a Christian is
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.320]   not a Christian. There are strange ideas, as I say, as to what makes a man a
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.440]   Christian. So we've got to examine ourselves. We've got to make sure. This is
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.120]   the most vital thing in the whole of life. This is the thing that determines
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.000]   not only how we live in this world, but how we die, and how we're going to spend
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.280]   that unknown eternity. We can't afford to take risks. Let's examine ourselves in
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.800]   the light of the teaching that we find here, in connection with this particular
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:51.880]   man. Now here we've got, I say, a very definite type. If you like, you can call
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:09:00.520]   him the intellectual type, the moral type, the religious type of person. That's what
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.120]   we are going to look at. So that as we study the case of this man and his
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.400]   conversion, of how he became a Christian, in addition to discovering these great
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.160]   essentials, as I call them, we shall incidentally be discovering something
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.220]   else. And this is the thing that I want to emphasize in particular tonight. This
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.600]   is too great a case to deal with in one night. But I want to deal with this one
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.760]   particular thing. Here is a case above every other, in a sense, that shows us the
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.960]   difference between being religious and being Christian. Now that's a very vital
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.760]   distinction. In many ways, the greatest enemy of Christianity is religion. I
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.000]   don't care what type of religion it is. It was the greatest obstacle in our
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.920]   Lord's own time. His greatest antagonists were the religious people, the Pharisees,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.160]   the scribes, the Sadducees, the doctors of the law. These were the people who
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.720]   opposed the Apostles. This has ever been, throughout the centuries, the great
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   trouble. So there is nothing more vital than that we should know, beyond any
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.560]   doubt or poor adventure this evening, as to whether we are just religious, or
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.640]   whether we are truly Christian. This is the most vital thing we can ever
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.600]   discover about ourselves. Very well. This man's going to help us to do so. Now what
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.360]   do we find here? Well, there is one general point I want to make before I
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:42.600]   come to the details of this man's character. Can you read a story like this
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:50.240]   without being impressed by the greatness of life? What a tremendous thing life is.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.360]   Look at this man, great man. There he is going on, in the condition I'm going to
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:04.680]   unfold him. And yet, everything changes. What a tremendous thing life is. What
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:12.400]   issues are involved. What a problem life is. Now this man shows us all that quite
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.720]   clearly, and what a serious thing life is. And what glorious possibilities there
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:25.160]   are in life. I was dealing with this, in introducing this whole subject, last
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.840]   Sunday evening, you remember. The angel suddenly appearing and dealing with
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.440]   Philip. The man, at the most unexpected moment, in the most unexpected place,
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.600]   suddenly being confronted by the very teacher he needs, and the great and
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.720]   glorious transformation in the whole of his life. Oh, what a tremendous thing life
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:55.480]   is. The greatest tragedy, I believe, at this moment in this world, is the failure
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:03.080]   of so many people to realize the greatness of life. Just think how the
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:10.760]   average person is spending this very evening. What are they doing? Don't you
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.160]   see the triviality of it all? The superficiality that is so characteristic
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.400]   of it all. You see, the trouble is not only that they're not Christian, but they
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.600]   don't realize what a tremendous thing life is. It's a joke. It's something you
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.960]   can dismiss with a sneer. Something you can be sarcastic and clever about. What a
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.840]   debased view of life. No, no, if I were not a Christian at all, I should protest
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   against this. Life's not a joke. Not something to be dismissed with a quip or
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:54.400]   a sneer or a bit of cleverness. If this story does nothing else, it will enable
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.880]   us to look at a great man who realized what a tremendous thing life is, and what
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.880]   a great thing it is to live, and the whole problem of existence. If you are on
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.600]   the very surface, and you see this is the note that is so characteristic of the
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.800]   Bible from beginning to end, there is no book in the world that gives such an
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:25.040]   impression of the bigness and the profundity of life as this book of God.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.780]   And that's why we must read it and pay attention to it, and try together to
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.520]   understand it. Very well, here it is. Well now, let's begin to look at the details.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.400]   Let's look at this man. Where is there in that chariot? What sort of man was he?
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.640]   Well, I say the first thing that strikes us about him is that he's obviously a man
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.880]   in a great position. He's riding in a chariot, perhaps surrounded by other
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.160]   chariots, certainly surrounded by a number of servants, because he was a
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.280]   very great man, and he was in a very great position. He was a man, we are told,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:12.680]   of great authority under this Queen of the Ethiopians, and he had charge of all
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.280]   her treasure. Now, you know in those ancient courts there were these various
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.320]   courtiers, and there was this type of man that generally was given this highest
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.880]   position, type of Chancellor of the Exchequer, if you like, or even more
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.120]   important than that in those days. To him had been entrusted this great charge in
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.360]   connection with that particular kingdom. You're immediately impressed by the fact,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.080]   therefore, that you're dealing with a very big man, and a very great man, and a
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.440]   very important man. But that, of course, tells us other things about him at once,
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.640]   and the other thing is that he was obviously a very able man. You didn't get
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.440]   into such a position unless you'd got ability. He gives further proof of his
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:02.680]   ability by the fact that he's able to read. Everybody couldn't read then, but
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.520]   here's a man who even in those days was able to read. He's an able man, an
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:14.800]   intelligent man, an educated man. He's a man quite out of the ordinary in the
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.040]   gifts, and the propensities, and the faculties that he possesses. In addition
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   to that, it is quite clear that he is a moral man, a man of good character. No man
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.680]   was ever put into this position unless he was a reliable character, a man of
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.400]   upright, moral, straight dealings, a man who could be trusted. He was handling
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.060]   great wealth, and he was put into that position because it was known that he
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.600]   was the sort of man whom you could trust. His character was well known, and he was
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.180]   well known as a man of wisdom, judgment, balance, utter honesty, absolute
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.280]   reliability. Now, there he is. Well, that is quite clear to him in just these
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.880]   little glimpses that we're given here in this kind of cameo that Luke paints to
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.120]   such perfection. But you've got to search for these things and see them. Realize
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.840]   the sort of men you're dealing with. Well, now, he was that sort of man, and in
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.720]   this position, obviously, he was living the kind of life that people of this
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.960]   type, and of this character, and of this position lived in the courts in those
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.000]   ancient days. You've read about these in history books. You've read about them in
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.120]   story books. You've seen them, perhaps, on the television. The life of a
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.000]   typical ancient court in the first century. It had its interests. It had its
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.440]   kind of culture. It had its drinking, and its dancing, and its feasting, and all
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.560]   these things. The typical life of a court. A court today, a court then. Even
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:01.080]   more magnificent than now. Well, now, here is a man who, there he is, that's the
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.240]   kind of man you're looking at. But you see, there are so many things that I can
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.480]   tell you about this man. And the first thing I have to tell you about him is
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:20.680]   that he was dissatisfied with all that. He was unhappy. He'd got this ability, and
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.720]   he knew it. Men of ability know they've got it. It's a part of their ability to
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.920]   know it, and he knew it, and his position told him that. And yet, you see, with all
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:39.040]   his ambition, and his high position, and his ability, and all these things, this
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:46.520]   man was unhappy. Dissatisfied. How do I know that? Well, I know that in this way.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:54.160]   This man, remember, is an Ethiopian. But I'm told that he had come to Jerusalem
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.800]   for to worship. What does that mean? Well, that tells me immediately that this man
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:10.160]   had become a proselyte Jew. He'd ceased to be a pagan, and he had taken up the
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.280]   Jew's religion, had become a proselyte. And so he had been up to Jerusalem and
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:24.120]   was now returning, because he'd been up to Jerusalem, to worship God after the
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.400]   manner and the teaching of the Jews. Now this is a tremendous fact, and we must
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:35.040]   realize the significance of this. Here is a man brought up in paganism, a pagan by
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.120]   birth, brought up in a pagan culture and tradition and background. There is his
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.520]   position. But he's not happy, he's dissatisfied. And he had become so
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.840]   dissatisfied with it that he had forsaken it. And it had probably been
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.560]   done at considerable risk, but many had done it in that ancient world. And he had
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.320]   become a practicing Jew. Now the great question confronting us is this, why did
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:08.160]   he do this? He's not the only one who did it. I deliberately read to you at the
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.320]   beginning that section out of the 17th chapter of the book of the Acts of the
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.560]   Apostles, in order that I might give you the great illustration and example and
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:21.240]   teaching concerning this very matter. Because there, you see, we are shown
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:27.480]   exactly the same thing. The pagan world was a very big world. The Jews, this
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.520]   little nation, this little people, were a great exception in that ancient world.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.680]   They were surrounded by pagans in different stages and degrees of paganism,
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.520]   from the most primitive to the most cultured and exalted, such as you found
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:50.800]   in Greece, in Athens, of all places, in the philosophers and the Stoics and the
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.480]   Epicureans. Well now, here is a man, obviously, who can be compared very
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.960]   readily with those Athenians, because he's a man, as I say, of ability and
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.480]   understanding of knowledge and of training. And, you see, what we are told
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.400]   about him is what we are told about those Athenians, that with all they had
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.880]   they were dissatisfied. Did you notice that pregnant statement about the
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   Athenians? We are told that for all the Athenians and the strangers that were
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.920]   there, did nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing. Why were
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.840]   they always interested in something new? There's only one answer. They were not
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:38.080]   satisfied with what they had. The people are always watching about the latest
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.900]   culture, the latest teaching. They're always betraying themselves and telling
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.880]   us that they're dissatisfied with what they've got, and so they were in Athens.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.760]   There was this profound dissatisfaction, and this man shared it. In what respects
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.320]   were they dissatisfied? Well, there was obviously intellectual dissatisfaction.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.200]   You see, this is the old kind of philosophy, isn't it? They found
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.760]   themselves in this world, and they found it a world of contradictions and of
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.880]   problems and of difficulties, and they tried to understand it, tried to
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.040]   understand men, tried to understand life, tried to understand death, tried to
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.760]   understand history, and they grappled with their great minds with all these
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.040]   problems. They divided up into rival schools, but all together they couldn't
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:34.240]   arrive at it. It ended with a question. They were great at asking questions.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.120]   Philosophers always are. The tragedy with the philosopher is that he can never
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.880]   answer them. He's very good at propounding them, and he can see the
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.680]   weakness in the other men's theory, but all end on the same level. They don't
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:53.760]   know. Intellectual dissatisfaction. And so when a strange teacher turned up, as
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.980]   Paul did on that occasion in Athens, they crowded round to hear him. What will this
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.200]   Bibler say? There were traveling teachers. They went round, put up their standing,
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.360]   and then they began to speak, you see, and there they were listening. Ah, he's got
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.460]   something new. What is this? This is strange. What is this new doctrine? This,
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:15.600]   oh, what a perfect description it is of this modern world. All the cleverness and
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.800]   the interest and the excitement, how intriguing they say, and they rush from
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.120]   one to the other. Oh, I say, let me say it again, your television gives you this
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.560]   almost every night, certainly three nights a week regularly, but almost every
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:35.240]   night of the week, this apparent interest and excitement about the new. It's a
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:42.640]   manifestation of intellectual bankruptcy. They don't know. So they rush after the
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.960]   latest teacher and the latest novelty. But not only was there intellectual
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:55.600]   dissatisfaction, there was moral dissatisfaction. This man, like any
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.720]   intelligent man looking on at the life of the court, could see the utter
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:07.000]   superficiality of it all. The glamour and the glitter and the supposed
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.560]   sophistication. What a farce it is, what a mask it is. They're not people. They put
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:20.360]   on the mask and the affectation. But all the sin that accompanied it, the
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.680]   dishonesty, the chicanery, this man, in his position, he saw it all, he knew it all.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.000]   He knew the private accounts of so many of these people. And there he saw it and
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.240]   he saw through it and he was disgusted with it. And then when you saw it on the
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:41.400]   lower levels, the debauchery, the drunkenness, the sexual orgies, and all
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.600]   the foulness, the perversions, and everything, he saw it all, he knew all
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.920]   about it. I needn't keep you. It's all described in many notable passages in
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.600]   the New Testament. You needn't even go there, read your newspapers, and there
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.200]   you'll find it. Look at your television, you'll see it. That was the life. He saw
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.520]   it and he was disgusted. But yes, the question was still how to overcome it,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:08.000]   how to get out of it. "Oh, is there no rule?" he said. "Is there no conduct? Is there no
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.800]   curb?" He was searching for something, for a liberating word. He was searching for
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.680]   moral power, moral dynamics, something that could stand between him and never
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.560]   falling to the same sin. The man wanted moral liberation. He couldn't find it in
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.000]   all his pagan teaching and all the lore of the society in which he'd been brought
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:34.580]   up. And in the same way, and beyond it all, there was a religious dissatisfaction.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.800]   Because he was religious. Everybody's religious. There's no such thing as a
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:48.240]   mere religious person. Every man is a god and he worships him. See, this is the truth
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.800]   about religion. There's no such thing as a mere religious person. You know how in
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.840]   the ancient world they had all sorts of gods. Some, of course, believed there were
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.480]   spirits in trees and even in stones. Others worshipped the sun and the moon
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:09.440]   and the stars. Others had created gods for themselves. Bell and these various
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:16.040]   other gods. Jupiter, Mercurius, Mars, God of Peace, God of War, God of Love. As Paul
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.920]   tells those Athenians, he observed that they were too superstitious, which means
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:27.280]   literally translated, too religious. He found Athens literally cluttered up with
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:34.440]   temples. And in these temples they worshipped their various gods. And they
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.800]   took their offerings and their sacrifices to them. Now, this man had been
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.120]   doing all this. We don't know exactly what kind of paganism he had and what
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.840]   kind of God he worshipped. But what we do know is this, that he'd seen through it
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.920]   all. He'd seen the vanity of it all. He knew these gods didn't exist. That there
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.060]   were mere figments of men's imaginations. That they had no reality. They had no
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:02.740]   power. They had no being. As those false gods that challenged and met Elijah, you
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.740]   remember, on the Mount Carmel in their hour of need, when they cried out unto
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.600]   their gods, there was no reply. There was dead silence. There is no bell. There is
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   no such thing. There is no idol. It's all the creation of men's mind and
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.640]   imagination. This man had seen through it all. The vanity of idolatry. The vanity
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.880]   of paganism. He was looking for a god worthy of his worship. You see, they were
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.360]   doing it in Athens. You remember that interesting and fascinating statement
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.840]   that's made in that 17th chapter of Acts? That Paul not only saw that they were
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.400]   too religious, but he was particularly attracted by this one temple. All the
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.800]   temples had got the name of the God over the doorpost. Jupiter, Mercurius,
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.480]   Mars, and so on. But here's the place. The unknown God. What does this mean? Oh, this
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.440]   is the attempt of the Greek philosophers to find the God that's at the back of
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.320]   all the gods. They knew it. They said our gods are not adequate. They don't explain
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.120]   sufficiently. There is a God behind them all. There is a divinity that shapes our
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.680]   ends, a few of them, how we may. There is a power over the powers, and they were
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.280]   seeking for him. If happily they might seek after him and find him, but they
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:28.280]   couldn't. That was exactly the position of this man. All he had didn't satisfy him,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.640]   either intellectually, morally, or religiously. And so he had done something
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.040]   about it. And what he had done about it, as I've reminded you, is that he had
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:48.600]   become a Jew. He'd become a Jewish proselyte. He was, as I say, a man from
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:56.800]   Ethiopia, not a Jew. But he'd become a Jew. He'd taken this great step. Many had
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.360]   taken it about the same time. There were numbers of these Jewish proselytes at
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.080]   that very time. There were numbers of them in Egypt. It was for them in
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.120]   particular that the Old Testament had been translated into Greek, into Septuagint
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:19.640]   translation. These were pagans who had become Jews, that turned to the Jewish
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:26.600]   teaching and to the Jewish religion. This man had done that. What does this mean?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:32.640]   Well, you see, this had meant a great transformation in his life. As I've told
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.600]   you, he's a serious man. He's a man who's concerned about his existence and about
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.960]   his life. And as to what the meaning of it all is, how is he going to
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.560]   meet death, what lies beyond, he wants to know. He can't get satisfaction. Here is a
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.800]   teaching which seems to him to be satisfactory. What is the teaching he's
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.440]   taken up? Well, it is the typical teaching of the Jews. The teaching, if you like, of
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.000]   the Old Testament. The teaching of the Jews at the time of John the Baptist and
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.320]   of our Lord. The teaching of the Jews that was still current at this very time
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:14.000]   in Jerusalem where he'd been visiting. He'd undergone a great change in the
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.600]   matter of his belief, therefore. And from believing in a multiplicity of gods, he
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:29.340]   now has come to see that there is only one true and living God. Here is the
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.920]   explanation he's been seeking. Here is the answer to the problem. What is the
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.520]   truth? Well, it is this great truth that is stated at the beginning of the book
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:43.920]   of Genesis. In the beginning, God created. There were theories about the origin of
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.200]   life in this time, remember? There's nothing new about that. These ancient
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.920]   philosophers had speculated a great deal with regard to the origin of life, even
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.200]   as people who believe the theory of evolution is still doing it today. They
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.640]   are just reverting to this old speculation and theorizing with regard
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.280]   to the explanation of these things. But the Jew was unique and separate. He said
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.720]   dogmatically he'd received a revelation. This was the thing about the Jew that
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.280]   differentiated him. The Jew was not a philosopher. The Greeks were the
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.560]   philosophers. The Jew didn't claim to be a philosopher. They were a simple people,
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.800]   an agricultural people. What made them unique? Ah, what made them unique was this.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.040]   They said, "We've got a revelation. We haven't thought it out. We haven't arrived
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.560]   at conclusions. We haven't been investigating and examining. God has
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:39.760]   spoken to us. We know nothing apart from what we have received." And their teaching
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:45.840]   was, therefore, that this true and living God had made the world and all that is in
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:52.760]   it. You see the very teaching that Paul expanded to those Athenians. He began by
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.020]   telling them, "God dwelleth not in temples made with hens. You are God's do. They can
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.520]   be put even into a box because there's nothing there. But God can't be confined.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:09.440]   Why? He's made everything. And all things consist and subsist as the result of the
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:16.520]   word of his power." Not only that, they thought that this God was of it all and
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:24.760]   who'd made everything, men included, very especially. Oh, he'd made in his own image
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:31.540]   and likeness. And therefore, this man has got a new conception of man, an exalted
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:37.040]   one, which links him in this way with the everlasting and true God. Furthermore,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.960]   they went on to say that this great God had got a purpose and a plan with respect
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:47.680]   to life in this world. And that whatever men may have done, and they could review
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.060]   the history, this man was the sort of man who'd know the history, that whatever men
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:56.880]   might be doing and governments and clashes and wars and cabinet changes and
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.960]   all the new arrangements, whatever men might do like that was ultimately
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:07.320]   relevant, that what really mattered was this great purpose of God. And the Jew was
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:13.280]   able to show this by taking people through his own history. He was forever
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.640]   telling people and reminding himself of how God had created him as a nation out
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:24.360]   of that one man, Abraham. And he'd done so because, as he said to Abraham, "In thee
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:30.320]   and in thy seed shall all the nations of the world be blessed." At last, there is a
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.000]   light, there is a purpose. God is behind it all. God is bringing his great
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.560]   purposes to pass. This was the teaching. The Jews claimed a uniqueness. They said,
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.540]   "We've got a message." Paul, you remember, putting it to the Romans in the third
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.200]   chapter, puts it like this. He raises the question, he says, "If you," somebody
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.960]   says to him, "If you, Paul, are saying that the Jew needs salvation as much as the
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.320]   Gentile, well, what advantage, then, has the Jew?" "Ah," says Paul, "much every way, because
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.560]   unto him was given the oracles of God." That's the Old Testament, the Word of God,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.840]   this great light on God and his purpose. Now, this man had come to see this and
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:23.120]   to believe this. Not only that, you see, at last he has found, he thinks, the guidance
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:30.440]   that he needed in a moral respect. He wants to know how to live. All the Greek
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:36.180]   philosophers had speculated, but it was a notorious fact that their lives were
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.280]   loose, they were dissolute. Sexual perversions were commonest amongst the
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.600]   philosophers, even as suicide was to be found in a higher percentage and
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:53.280]   proportion amongst them than any other single section of society. Some of the
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.560]   most terrible things happened amongst them, even in their very temples. These
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.960]   men, I say, had not only become dissatisfied, he longed for a way of life,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:10.760]   he longed for a rule, for a law, at last he finds it. The law of God, this same God,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:16.920]   this holy, just, righteous God, as given to the nation of Israel, the Jews, through
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:26.440]   Moses. He's got it, the Ten Commandments. The first table, the second table. Only
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:34.320]   one God. He alone is to be worshipped. Mustn't bow down to any graven image.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.440]   Mustn't take the name of this God in vain. He must respect the day that he's
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:48.560]   appointed for himself. One in seven is to be given to him. Second table. Thou shalt
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:55.360]   not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not bear
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.120]   false witness, etc. Honor thy father and mother. Oh, says this man, this is the very
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.480]   thing I've been looking for. Here is morality, here is the way to live, here is
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.920]   holiness, here is justice, here is righteousness. He couldn't find it
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.640]   anywhere. At last he hears of it here, and he accepts it, he becomes a Jew. This is
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:20.160]   the way to live, keeping the Ten Commandments. So he had become a Jew. And
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   likewise with regard to worship. He's seen through that other way, and at last he's
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:36.920]   told what he regards as the only true way. God has got to be worshipped by
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:43.960]   means of sacrifices. God has got to be approached with reverence and godly
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:51.440]   fear. You've got to have a priesthood, and a high priest over them all. And there are
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:57.360]   rules and regulations. Lambs have got to be offered, hands are going to be placed
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.600]   on the head of bullocks, and they've been got to be killed, the blood's got to be
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.480]   taken, it's got to be sprinkled before an ark and presented to God, burnt
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.720]   offerings, sacrifices, meal offerings. This is the only way to approach God.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:17.640]   Men, the ordinary men, must stay in that outer cot. The priests can go a little
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.520]   bit further to the holy place, then there's a veil and the holiest of all,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.760]   and only the high priest can enter, and even he only once a year, and he can't go
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.440]   in except with blood, and it's a momentous thing when he does, will he
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.240]   come out, this holy God, this Shekinah glory that shines down upon it all, here
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   is the way of worship. And he recognizes it, and he submits to it. The priesthood
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.560]   and the sacrifices, the tabernacle and the temple, and all the ceremonial and
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:57.080]   the Jewish way of worship described in the Old Testament and in the New. And so,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   he had taken up all this, he'd ceased to be a pagan, he'd become a Jew, and he was
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:08.720]   living with all his might this kind of life. Not eating certain types of meat,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.760]   observing certain special days, certain festivals, submitting to the regulations,
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.800]   washing hands punctiliously when you come from the market before you sit down
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.640]   to eat, tithing mint and rue and anise and cumming, washing cups and pots and
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:31.360]   pans, 614 regulations, and doing his utmost to keep them and to carry them
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.520]   out punctiliously. That's what had happened to him, the man that ceased to
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.960]   be a pagan and had become a Jew. But I want to show you something further about
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:48.200]   him. He not only had taken this up in a kind of perfunctory manner, he had taken
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:54.720]   it up with great thoroughness. Have you observed the zeal of this man? He was a
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:00.640]   highly religious man. He didn't have his religion as it were just on Sunday or in
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.880]   a bag. No, no, this man's whole life was involved. This was the biggest thing in
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.520]   his whole existence. He was a highly religious man. I can give you proof of
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:20.400]   it. He'd gone up to Jerusalem. The events of six months ago should have put you
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:26.200]   right on your geography. If not, read it again, look up your atlases. It was a long
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:32.240]   journey, especially in those days, and a very hazardous journey. It involved a lot
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.760]   of absence from his work and from his office. Didn't matter, he must go there.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:43.000]   You see, he wasn't satisfied even now. He wants further instruction. He wants
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.160]   further knowledge. There are authorities up there in Jerusalem which he can't
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.360]   find in Ethiopia. He wants to go to the headquarters. He wants to listen to the
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.160]   greatest Pharisee. Gamaliel was one of them, and Hillel was another. He says, "If
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.280]   I can only listen to these, they'll give me something more." So he takes this
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.440]   hazardous and difficult journey in order to find yet something further, because
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.860]   though he's changed his religion and has taken this up with great thoroughness,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:16.720]   still he's aware of further need. He hasn't found rest, he hasn't found peace.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:24.200]   So he takes his journey up to a festival, a religious festival in Jerusalem. And on
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:32.920]   top of all that, he does another thing. He takes this vital step of buying a copy
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.480]   of a certain part of the Scriptures. He bought a copy of the book of the Prophet
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:44.360]   Isaiah. You see, as I say, he was an able man and he was able to read. And he said
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.960]   to himself, "Well, of course I haven't the advantage that people living in Jerusalem
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.720]   have of hearing these great authorities whenever I like, Sunday by Sunday, on
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.760]   weekdays, and of going to them and putting my questions. I'll buy their very
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.400]   Scriptures, the Scriptures they expound. I'll read them for myself. I'll study them."
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:05.320]   You see the man, he's taking it all so desperately seriously. He realizes the
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.920]   momentous character of these things. He wants the answer, he wants light, he
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:24.280]   wants knowledge, he wants peace. And so he takes these vital steps. And yet, you see
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:31.440]   the picture we are confronted with? It's that of a man in trouble. It's that of a
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:38.760]   man who's terribly burdened. The whole picture conveys that to us. Now, the
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.800]   details are really very interesting and important here. He had deliberately
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:52.120]   chosen to go home by the desert road. I reminded you last Sunday night, many of
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.040]   you, most of you, perhaps, that there were two roads which he could have chosen to
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:03.080]   go home from Jerusalem. He deliberately chose the desert route. There was another
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.720]   route that didn't go through a desert way. He deliberately chooses the desert
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.400]   route. Why do you think he did that? I have no difficulty at all in answering the
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.440]   question. He wanted time to think. He was a big man and an important man. And if
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.040]   he'd gone on the other road, wherever he'd stopped to have a meal or to refresh
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.680]   himself, people would have come and have talked to him and have gossiped with him,
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.840]   asked his opinion on political questions and various
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.040]   other things, and he didn't want it. Others would have been anxious to entertain him
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.680]   and to make a fuss of him because of his greatness and his great position would
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.640]   have considered it an honor to do so. He didn't want it. He didn't want the
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.920]   adulation of men, he didn't want their praise, he didn't want their conversation
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.440]   and their chit-chat. All of this to him was irrelevant and unimportant. All the
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.080]   great question of the soul and of God and of eternity. He chooses the desert
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.320]   road to have peace and rest from all the noise and clatter and chatter of the
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:11.960]   world and its trivialities. Because he was in trouble. Because he's not at rest.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:19.560]   Because in spite of visiting Jerusalem, he still hasn't got satisfaction. And I
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.920]   further see this in this extraordinary thing, that even while traveling in his
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:31.560]   chariot he was reading the Scriptures. Couldn't wait until he got home, had a
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:37.280]   start at once. He's only just left Jerusalem, doesn't matter. This is the
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.320]   burden, this is the problem. He's in an agony of soul. He's looking for something
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.400]   he can't find. He's changed his religion, he's got better things than he'd ever
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.160]   had before, but still he can't find the rest and the peace. So he starts reading
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.440]   the Scriptures, he's not even on the way home, traveling through the desert way.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:03.200]   He's got more time to concentrate. And don't you see this trouble and this
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.360]   burdened condition? Even in his very voice and his accent, his tones, Philip
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.720]   runs to him and puts his famous question, "Understand this, thou art a readist." And he
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:24.360]   said, "How can I, except some men guide me?" Do you hear the note of despair? Do you
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:30.480]   hear the note of hopelessness? The man's in real trouble. He's still seeking, he's
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:38.440]   still dissatisfied, in spite of all that he has done. There's the position. Have I
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.360]   been dishonest in handling it? Can you show me my error? There isn't any. These
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.760]   are the sheer facts, staring us in the face as we look at this man. But now I
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.400]   want to call your attention as I close to the tragedy of his position. The
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.920]   tragedy of this man, of course, was nothing but the tragedy of all the Jews
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:03.880]   who rejected the gospel. This is the great tragedy. Here's a man who's just been up to
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:11.320]   Jerusalem, and he goes home as hopeless as he was when he went up. Where's the
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:19.240]   tragedy? The tragedy is this. Something had already happened in Jerusalem which
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.000]   had the full and the perfect and the complete answer to his every question
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.920]   and to his every need. But he hasn't heard it. In Jerusalem, just outside the
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:36.380]   wall of the city, the thing that happened which will give complete satisfaction, he
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:42.480]   knows nothing about it. That, I say, was the trouble with all the Jews. Had this
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.440]   man - now this is a bit of interesting speculation - do you think he'd heard
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:53.520]   about the Lord Jesus Christ on his visit to Jerusalem? We don't know, but we can be
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.400]   fairly sure of this. As a Jewish proselyte, he would have turned in
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:04.600]   circles where if the name of Jesus had been mentioned at all, it was mentioned
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:10.760]   simply to be criticized, to be denounced, to be dismissed as a blasphemer, to be
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:18.160]   rejected. And he had undoubtedly accepted such teaching. And the result of this is
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:23.240]   that he goes back to his home as dejected and as troubled and as
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.160]   dissatisfied as he was when he left his home. What is this? Oh, my dear friend, this
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:35.480]   is just the tragedy of all people who are merely religious. It is one of the
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:41.080]   most perfect descriptions in the whole of the Scripture of the tragedy of the
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:48.760]   religious men. Now, what is it? Well, I'll put it to you in a few words. The
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.880]   Apostle Paul has said it all there in Romans 10. He says, "Look at my fellow
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:02.560]   countrymen. I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.800]   knowledge. They were most zealous, they were most keen, they were most
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:13.920]   pentilious, but," he says, "it's not according to knowledge. They're in ignorance.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.360]   They haven't got the light, the only thing that can give them satisfaction. Zeal
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:26.440]   without knowledge is the greatest waste of energy. It is sheer folly." And there, he
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:33.600]   says, "they are trusting to their own righteousness." Listen to his great words.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.620]   "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.480]   saved, for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.440]   knowledge. For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.320]   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.640]   righteousness of God." What does he mean? Well, what he means is this. Here they are,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.280]   he says, half-killing themselves, with all their rules and regulations and
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.560]   offerings and sacrifices and hair-cutting and sweating and all the rest that is
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:16.160]   involved. And they don't realize that it's all utterly useless. They going about to
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.440]   establish their own righteousness. Why do they do that? Because they are ignorant
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.960]   of the righteousness of God. This was the argument of the
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.800]   jinn, this was the position of this Ethiopian eunuch, this is the position of
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:37.480]   all religious people. They say, "if only I say my prayers regularly, if only I go
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.960]   to church regularly, and of course if I go very early in the morning it's so
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.120]   much better than the people who only go at eleven o'clock, if I don't do certain
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:53.720]   things, if I do good, if I evade certain sins, if I give a certain amount of money,
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:59.160]   if I do this, that, and the other, if I'm wholly religious and zealous, then I will
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:05.000]   satisfy God." They going about to establish their own righteousness. And
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.640]   what a business it is, all expressed in this expression, going about, compassing
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:17.600]   hill and land and sea, and hill and vale, doing all these things. But it's all
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:24.240]   utterly useless. They are ignorant of God's righteousness. What does God
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:30.840]   demand of us? Is your bit of religion and mine enough to satisfy God? Is your
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.920]   morality sufficient to put you in the presence of the holy and the absolute and
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:41.000]   the eternal? No, no. What does he demand? Well, the Ten Commandments have told you.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.680]   You see, there is all the difference in the world between accepting the Ten
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:53.000]   Commandments with your mind and living them. Paul tells us that, doesn't he? He
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.760]   thought he was keeping the commandments perfectly, and then he understood the
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.840]   meaning of the word "covert," and he suddenly found he'd never kept them at
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.000]   all. It isn't a matter of law, it isn't a matter of externalities, it isn't a
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.360]   matter of negativities. God says, "Here it is, thou shall love the Lord thy God with
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:18.480]   all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength." God
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.720]   demands absolute perfection, and if a man fails in one detail of the law, he's
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:31.440]   failed in it all. They didn't know that. And it was because they didn't know what
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.000]   God demanded in terms of righteousness that they were in their folly going about
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.440]   to establish their own righteousness. And it can't be done, and this poor Ethiopian
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.680]   has really discovered it. He's got new knowledge, he's got higher knowledge, but
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:53.400]   it doesn't put him right. He's failing, he can't do it. Not the hearers of the
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:50:01.240]   law, but the doers of the law are justified in God's sight. And so that
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:10.280]   brings us to the final tragedy of these people, this poor Ethiopian eunuch, and
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:16.960]   all of the Jews who thought as he now thought. Here is the supreme tragedy of
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:23.840]   this, that going about to establish their own righteousness and half-killing
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:34.080]   themselves, they refuse the offer of God's righteousness in Jesus Christ his
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:41.800]   Son. That's what this poor man was doing. That's what Philip went on to explain to
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:49.480]   him, and I hope to have the privilege of explaining it to you. All he was searching
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:56.200]   for was available. He didn't know it at this point, but there's a man just round
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.800]   the corner, a simple man called Philip. Not a great man, you know, not holding a
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.480]   high and exalted position, a mere nobody. He knows, he's got the answer. The
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.560]   poor Ethiopian, he doesn't do it, he's in trouble, he's reading, he's trying to
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:15.760]   ascend, and he can't. His soul is in agony, he doesn't know. There's the answer.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.840]   There's no need to ascend into the heaven, there's no need to go down into
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:26.800]   the depths. The word is nigh on him. Even in thy mouth and in thine heart, if thou
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:33.440]   shall believe on this Jesus, justification by faith only, this
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:38.760]   blessed message, that God has done for us what we could never do for ourselves,
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:44.000]   that God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.040]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Every man will
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:52.840]   perish apart from him. He is the only way of salvation. Man's righteousness is
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.880]   never enough. We need a righteousness from God, and God has provided it in his
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:04.400]   own Son, and he offers it to us as a free gift. Here's the tragedy of the Ethiopian
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:13.960]   eunuch. He's been up to Jerusalem, but he hasn't met the Christian Church. They've
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:22.000]   got everything he needs. Oh, but God is the God of love and of mercy and of
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.680]   compassion, and with all the effort and the striving and the journey of this
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:39.480]   man had not discovered God sent to him by sending his servant with a simple
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   glorious message, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." The
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:58.600]   poor pagan is hopeless. The Jew, better position, is still hopeless. There is no
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:04.360]   difference between the Jew and the Gentile for all have sinned and come
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:18.680]   short of the glory of God. My dear friend, the question for you is simply this. Have
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:26.760]   you got as far as this Ethiopian eunuch had got? Are you serious? Or are you
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.600]   dancing and washing and drinking and drugging your way through life? Have you
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.240]   seen the bigness of the possibilities? Have you considered the problem? Do you
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.200]   know there's a soul in you that's immortal? Have you faced it as this man
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:48.720]   faced it? This is the way. Have you come to this, I say? Have you done the things
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:58.120]   that this man has done? Even this isn't enough. But have you done anything? Have
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:04.640]   you realized your precarious position before the Holy God before whom you'll
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:12.720]   have to stand? Do you know anything about eternal torment and the damnation of
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:24.720]   hell? How are you living? Are you ready to die? Are you ready to face God? Look at
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   this man. Look at this story. Follow him. Emulate him. And be as ready as he was to
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:44.240]   listen to the glorious message of salvation in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:51.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
