[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   #Blessed
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   It's a social media tag for when someone feels blessed and who has or is getting everything
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.960]   they dreamed of getting.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.720]   It can range from getting a new girlfriend, a new job, a pay raise, finding a $10 bill
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.600]   on the sidewalk, or getting surprisingly good news.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.640]   But what does it mean to truly be blessed according to scripture?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800]   That's a very different discussion, one initiated by a discerning listener to the
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.320]   podcast named Jordan.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.480]   He writes this, "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.860]   Of late, I have been having discussions with my friends around what it means to be blessed.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.360]   The term 'blessed' is thrown around in our culture today, and it's all over our
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360]   Bibles too.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.440]   To me, it seems like the way God uses 'blessed' or 'blessings' in the Bible is very different
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.960]   from how it's used now.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.080]   I see the term 'blessed' associated with material possessions or family or health.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.800]   These can be all good things, but I think you could also argue that if these blessings
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.400]   lead us further away from God, they are not true blessings at all."
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.400]   On the other hand, Jesus says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit."
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   Matthew 5:3.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.840]   And he said, "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake."
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   Matthew 5:10.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.720]   And he said, "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.000]   kinds of evil against you falsely on my account."
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.400]   Matthew 5:11.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.800]   Rarely, if ever, do I see people posting about how blessed they are as poor in spirit or
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.720]   persecuted, like we read about in the Beatitudes.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.880]   With that in mind, what is a biblical definition of what it means to be truly blessed?
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.380]   Jordan puts his finger on the nub of the issue, I think, by referring to the Beatitudes in
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.380]   Matthew 5.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.800]   I'm going to circle back and probably end there and affirm what he sees and show why
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.180]   it is such a great answer to his own question.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:09.000]   But first, let me lay down a principle that has helped me grasp why there is such a preponderance
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.340]   of earthly blessings promised in the Old Testament, like the inheritance of land, Psalm 37, 22,
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.420]   deliverance from our enemies, Psalm 41, 1, fruitfulness in our families and our fields,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.660]   Genesis 17, 20, 48, 4.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.100]   While in the New Testament, there are very few earthly blessings promised, but rather
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:45.140]   afflictions are promised with the material physical blessings largely postponed until
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.140]   the resurrection.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.660]   So here's the principle.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.820]   In God's wisdom, the Jewish religion of the Old Testament was largely a common sea
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.860]   religion.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.020]   Israel was the showcase of God's blessings among the nation.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.740]   So for example, in 1 Kings 10, it says, "When the queen of Sheba heard the fame of Solomon
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.520]   concerning the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.180]   And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he built,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.980]   the food of his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance of his servants
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.640]   and their clothing and his cupbearers and his burnt offerings that he offered the house
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.060]   of the Lord, there was no more breath in her."
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.220]   I call that the showcasing of the blessing of God on the people of God in the Old Testament.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.140]   There's nothing like that in the New Testament.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.620]   In God's wisdom, the church of Jesus Christ is not an ethnic or geographical or political
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.600]   or national entity.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.900]   It cuts across all ethnicities, all geographies, all politics, nationalities.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.300]   There is no geographic center for Christianity.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.600]   There's no great temple like Edifice in Christianity.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.980]   There are no places to do pilgrimages in Christianity.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.300]   There are no priests or saints through whom we have to go to God, but only Jesus Christ.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.020]   And instead of telling the world to come to us, "Come see how I bless my people."
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.020]   God never says that.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.540]   He says, "Go, go to the world.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.900]   And if it costs you your life, lay it down."
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.980]   But he says very plainly, "Whoever would be my disciple must renounce everything that
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.500]   he has," Luke 14, 33, "put it at the disposal of me and my mission."
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.060]   That's the kind of radical life we're called to live in the New Testament.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.120]   So there's the principle.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.500]   And the failure to recognize this distinction between God's plan for Israel in the Old Testament
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.020]   and God's plan for the church in the New Testament has caused a lot of people to put
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.100]   way too much emphasis on earthly blessings today.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.340]   And I think one of the most illumining texts about how we are blessed as Christians, which
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:26.180]   we are, I would say infinitely blessed, is 1 Corinthians 3, 21 to 23.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.380]   It goes like this.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.500]   "So let no one boast in men, for all things are yours."
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   Let that sink in.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.620]   Oh, glory.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.500]   All things are yours.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:51.580]   Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future,
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.020]   all are yours.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.880]   And you are Christ's.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.660]   And Christ is God's.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.660]   What a verse.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.660]   I love it.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.660]   It's amazing.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.660]   It is.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:09.180]   To belong to Christ is to belong to God as our Father and to be heirs of all that God
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.140]   owns, that is, everything.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.180]   Paul says, "The world is yours.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.580]   All things are yours."
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.700]   Jesus said, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the world."
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.340]   You cannot be richer than a Christian is rich.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.740]   Put all the billionaires together.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.580]   I should have taken the time to find out their names.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.100]   You could name them.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.660]   Put all the billionaires in a sack, right?
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.020]   And they are paupers.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.900]   I mean, poverty-stricken paupers compared to the lowliest Christian.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.460]   But notice that in the list of things that belong to us is death.
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.300]   It's in the list.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.500]   All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.180]   Death is yours.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:10.700]   This means that you do not get all your blessings in this life, but that death itself belongs
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:20.420]   to you as a gift, as a doorway to infinite, eternal, immeasurable blessing.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.420]   Death becomes your servant because of Christ's triumph over death.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:33.540]   The Apostle John heard a voice from heaven saying, "Blessed are the dead who die in
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.820]   the Lord."
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.780]   Revelation 14, 13.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.500]   Why is that?
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:46.820]   Paul answers in Ephesians 1, 3, "God has blessed us in Christ with every blessing that
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:54.640]   heaven can conceive, for the eternal happiness of God's people will be ours."
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:02.200]   But Jesus taught us explicitly not to expect them now.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:10.180]   For example, in Luke 14, 13, he said, "When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled,
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:17.660]   the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you."
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.180]   I love Jesus' logic.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.780]   You will be blessed because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.820]   of the just.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.300]   That's the orientation of Jesus Christ, the King.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.740]   That's the New Testament pattern.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:43.420]   Eternal generosity and service now, spectacular blessing later at the resurrection.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:51.380]   Or here's the way James puts it, "Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial,
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:58.420]   for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.540]   to those who love him."
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.460]   James 1, 12.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.580]   First the trial, then the blessing.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.260]   The crown.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.580]   So let's circle back now to Jordan's reference to the Beatitudes.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:20.140]   I think the Beatitudes, taken together, provide a beautiful summary of the blessings promised
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.460]   to the followers of Christ.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:30.400]   Six immeasurable blessings are sandwiched between the summary promise, "Yours is the kingdom
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.640]   of heaven," verse 3, verse 10, "Yours is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:41.300]   So these six blessings summarize what it means to live forever under the kingdom, the heavenly
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.540]   rule of God.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.320]   Number one, we will see God, verse 8.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.480]   They shall see God.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.680]   The pure shall see God.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.880]   Number two, we will be shown mercy.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.280]   They shall receive mercy, verse 7.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.500]   Number three, we will be part of God's family, verse 9.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.020]   They shall be called the sons of God.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.260]   Number four, we will experience God's comfort, verse 4.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.300]   They shall be comforted.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:16.040]   Number five, we will be co-owners of the whole world, verse 5.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.760]   They shall inherit the earth.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.780]   Number six, we will be satisfied with personal and universal righteousness, verse 6.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.660]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:39.300]   So in summary, the presence of God seen and enjoyed in the face of Christ, covering us
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:46.020]   with mercy because of all our sins, calling us his children, comforting us for all pain
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:52.620]   and loss in this world, bequeathing to us the universe for a familiar homeland, and
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:58.700]   everything set right in our souls and in the social order of the new world.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.040]   This is our great reward.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.900]   This is what it means to be truly blessed.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.380]   Wonderful, eternal perspective that encompasses the coming new creation.
