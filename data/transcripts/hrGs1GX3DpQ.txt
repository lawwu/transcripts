[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   "What is the real cost of pornography?"
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.680]   John Piper explained in a small talk recorded at our recent 2015 Conference for Pastors
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680]   here in Minneapolis.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.640]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.360]   Not all sexual desire is lust.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.180]   God made sexual desire.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.240]   It has its good place.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.140]   In fact, it can become an act of worship in the temple of marriage.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.360]   But lust is a sexual desire gone wrong.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.560]   Here's my definition.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:47.400]   Lust is a sexual desire that dishonors its object and disregards God, disregards the
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.820]   promises and the warnings of having or losing the beauties of Christ.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:09.600]   The lusted after woman or man in your head or on the screen or on the street is dishonored,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.600]   not treated as a sacred, precious, eternal person in the image of God whose eternal destiny
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.760]   is always paramount and whose holiness we either long for or ignore.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.280]   And the only way that kind of dishonor can daringly be carried out and hold sway is by
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.320]   disregarding God while we are in the sway of lust.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.500]   Ponder with me for a few minutes the natural and the spiritual role of self-control in
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.120]   relation to lust.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.840]   Addiction, I think, is a relative term.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:08.000]   I would stake my life on the guess that in this room no one is absolutely addicted to
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   pornography or any sexual sin.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.640]   None of you is.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.520]   What I mean by this is if the stakes are high enough and sure enough, you will have all
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.160]   the self-control you need to conquer any sexual temptation.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:39.640]   For example, tonight if you are feeling totally in the sway of a sexual desire, more blazing,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   more powerful than you have ever felt it in your life, when you believe you cannot resist
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:01.840]   the temptation to look at some nudity online and suddenly a black hooded ISIS member drags
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.120]   your best friend or your spouse into the room with a knife at his throat or her throat and
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:19.640]   says, "If you look at that website, I will slit this throat," you will have self-control.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.120]   You are not addicted.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.720]   You won't click.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:33.760]   Or if a man walks into the room and says, "If you look at that nudity, I will not give
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.580]   you the million dollars that I have in this bag, cash tax-free, but if you do not look
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:50.980]   at that nudity, I will give you a satchel with $1 million in cash," you will have total
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.700]   self-control.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.780]   The fact is 99% of those who give way to lust in pornography or fornication or adultery
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.360]   are not decisively controlled by their sexual desire.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.980]   They are decisively controlled by what they believe.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.300]   What they believe will happen if they act on the lust or don't.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.160]   That's what controls them.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.980]   What they believe, not the sexual desire.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.340]   That's the excuse.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:33.780]   The decisive issue is whether they believe the stakes are high enough and sure enough.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.300]   If they are sure the friend will die a gruesome death, they will have self-control.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.540]   If they are sure enough, and that's real money in there, and it's really tax-free, and it
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.380]   isn't stolen goods, they will have self-control.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:00.220]   Now nothing I have said so far is distinctly Christian about that analysis of motivation.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.860]   That's just the way human beings are wired.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:16.780]   Self-control was a stoic virtue before it was a Christian fruit, and there is nothing
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.340]   distinctly Christian about self-control.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:30.340]   And yet, this is what engages my mind so much at this moment, and yet Paul lists it as a
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.620]   fruit of the Spirit.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:43.940]   The Spirit produces self-control in the believer so that the action of the self-controlling
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:52.820]   no is brought about by the Spirit.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:00.340]   Control your lusts for the Spirit is controlling them through you.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.140]   Isn't that the paraphrase of Philippians 2.12 applied to the fruit of the Holy Spirit?
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:15.180]   Self-control, because the Spirit is awakening, creating self-control in you.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:25.580]   The blood of Christ, the blood of the new covenant secures for us Christians the working
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.300]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.260]   That's the meaning of the new covenant.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.820]   Cause you to walk in my statutes.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.700]   I died to make that happen.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.800]   This is the new covenant.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.080]   This is the blood of the covenant.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.660]   And he works, and we act.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.840]   His working appears in our acting.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:56.260]   He creates the miracle, we act the miracle of self-control.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:05.260]   But the Holy Spirit doesn't produce the same thing the Stoics did.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:15.140]   Even though, "enchritia" in Greek or self-control in English is the same word used by Stoics,
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.140]   then and now.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.340]   The Holy Spirit doesn't create that.
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.160]   We don't hire God to produce the same things the world can produce.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.780]   How good would that be?
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:39.900]   The Stoics did not depend on Christ, and they did not live for the glory of Christ.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:49.140]   But the Holy Spirit is given because Christ died to purchase him for us, and he is given
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.340]   to glorify the Son in us.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:08:02.700]   John 14, 6, the blood of Christ was the price of our self-control, and the beauty of Christ
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.340]   is the mission of the Spirit in us.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:14.180]   The blood of Christ purchases the presence of the Christ-exalting Spirit, and the Spirit
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.020]   is there to exalt Christ in all that we do, including self-control.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:28.420]   Therefore, the way the Spirit produces self-control that is different from the world's self-control,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:35.340]   the way the Holy Spirit produces self-control in the believer is by revealing the beauties
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:42.300]   of Christ to our souls as supremely beautiful, supremely satisfying.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:50.460]   He removes the hardness of heart and the blindness of the soul so that it can see and savor the
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:09:02.020]   beauties of Christ for what they really are, and what he shows us through the word of Christ
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:12.500]   is that the all-satisfying beauties of Christ can be lost forever in the bondage of lust,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.300]   or they can be enjoyed forever in the purity of heart.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.580]   That's what he shows us.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.100]   That's how he works the miracle in us.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:31.820]   He shows us the day is coming, and now is, when we will enjoy Christ with the fullness
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:38.980]   of joy that outweighs every possible pleasure of lust, which brings us back now to Isis
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.380]   and the million dollars.
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:49.540]   He's about to slit the throat of your best friend, or about to give you a million dollars,
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:10:01.700]   and the Holy Spirit on this analogy shows us that the stakes are much higher than that.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:10.940]   That's what he reveals to us, that the stakes as we face the temptation of lust are higher.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:23.480]   The beauties of Christ, he reveals, can be lost forever in the bondage of lust, or enjoyed
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.820]   forever in the purity of heart, which means that the Holy Spirit by the word of Christ
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.320]   reveals this.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:38.020]   If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away, for it is better
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:45.220]   that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.060]   That's the final Isis slit.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   Way worse.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:11:01.180]   And the Holy Spirit brings to your mind, you can lose everything of Christ in the bondage
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.180]   of lust.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:10.660]   Or, and the Holy Spirit reveals to us the other word of Christ, "Blessed are the pure
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.180]   in heart.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.700]   They shall see God."
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:24.740]   A reward forever infinitely superior to a measly million dollars for which every one
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.980]   of you would have self-control.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.620]   It's just what we believe.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.740]   Control is a fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.100]   He creates the miracle, we act the miracle.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.620]   He creates it by opening our eyes to see the beauties of Christ, that they can be lost
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:52.780]   forever in bondage to lust, or they can be enjoyed forever in the purity of heart.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.460]   Such a rich approach to addressing lust.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:02.220]   That was John Piper's small talk, Lust, from the 2015 Desiring God Conference for Pastors.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.580]   All the content from the recent past con is now online at the website.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.940]   You can check it out.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:12.220]   This small talk, of course, coincides with our newest book titled, Kill Joys, The Seven
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.880]   Deadly Sins, a book you can download free of charge at desiringgod.org.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.140]   Click on the books tab and look for the title, Kill Joys.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.580]   Until we return, and I ask John Piper, what does the Church offer the world, realistically,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.260]   when it comes to racial reconciliation?
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.260]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.740]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
