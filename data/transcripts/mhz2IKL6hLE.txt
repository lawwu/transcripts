[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   A friend of mine in high school drove an old rusty car and on that old rusty car was a
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.680]   rather snarky bumper sticker.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.680]   In big font it read "Your Unique!"
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760]   And then in smaller font underneath it read "Just like everybody else!"
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.800]   It's a witty line.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.160]   "Your unique just like everybody else."
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.240]   It's witty, but there's an important question to be asked about human uniqueness.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.000]   According to the Bible, are we each uniquely made?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.640]   The question comes in from Dimitri who lives in Sri Lanka.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.960]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm a devoted listener to this podcast and an avid reader of your
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   books.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.280]   I've found so much clarity to many theological questions I've struggled with throughout
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   my life.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280]   So thank you.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400]   But I have this remaining question.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.160]   Did God make me unique?
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.080]   I have to assume that there are a lot of people similar to me across the globe and I'm rather
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.000]   un-unique in God's eyes.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.120]   I have come across plenty of Bible verses about how God created us for a specific providential
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   purpose.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.640]   There are others that speak of God's intimacy.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.400]   He knows the number of hairs on our head and every tear that we cry.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.360]   But does the Bible say I am unique compared to others?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.840]   I can't find a specific Bible verse to confirm it and yet I've heard it affirmed by trusted
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   preachers.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.840]   But is it biblical?
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.280]   Is human uniqueness defensible from the Bible?
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.040]   I think individual human uniqueness is defensible from the Bible but not directly.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.200]   That is, not by a quotation but only by implication.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   In other words, I don't know of any quotation from the Bible to the effect that every human
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.960]   being is in some way different from every other human being.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   There may be one and I just can't find it.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040]   You should write to us here at APJ if you find it.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.680]   So first, let me explain what I mean by the Bible pointing or by implication teaching
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.200]   a person's uniqueness and why that is important.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.560]   And then I'll close by focusing on something that I think is far more important.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.400]   So the first thing we need to do is establish two foundational truths about the way God
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   relates to each individual human.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.560]   The first is that he knits each person together in the womb.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:48.320]   And the second is that he governs by his providence every single one of the millions of influences
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   that shape what we become every day.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.840]   Cradle to the grave.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.640]   So first, God made every human, made them intricately with attention to everything about
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.120]   them genetically and every other way in their mother's womb.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.760]   Psalm 139 verse 13, "You formed my inward parts.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.800]   You knitted me together in my mother's womb."
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   Now the point is this.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.760]   The picture is not one of impersonal assembly line.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.840]   The picture is of a God with knitting needles in his hands, fashioning a garment stitch
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.220]   by stitch.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.160]   God created you, Demetri, by his infinite wisdom, including all the things that you
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.040]   like about yourself, all the things you don't like about yourself, all the strengths and
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.680]   all the weaknesses, all the abilities, all the disabilities.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.340]   He was knitting all of that together in your mother's womb.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.960]   When Moses complained to God that he couldn't speak and that God's promise to go with
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:16.320]   him and help him was of little comfort, God rebuked his doubt with these amazing words.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.440]   Who made man's mouth?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.960]   Who makes him mute or deaf or seeing or blind?
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.600]   Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.920]   Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.880]   So that's the Bible's first premise.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.520]   God made everybody, knitting us intricately and individually together in our mother's
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.560]   wombs just the way we are.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.080]   Second, God's providence is the all-embracing, all-pervasive work over all of our experience.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.360]   Nothing happens to you or has ever happened to you or will ever happen to you except what
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.200]   God plans.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.800]   Jesus made this point by picking one of the most random things, events in the world, and
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.240]   attributing it to God and only to God.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.560]   Matthew 10, 29.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.940]   I mean, how insignificant are they?
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:34.600]   And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:44.440]   Millions and millions and millions of sparrows in this world, thousands dying daily, utterly
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.600]   insignificant and unknown to man, and not one of them falling from a tree apart from
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.400]   God's providence.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.900]   Or as Proverbs says about another kind of random event, like rolling dice, the lot,
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.960]   we would say the dice, are cast in the lap, and every decision is from the Lord in Las Vegas.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   So the point is that nothing happens to you or has ever happened to you or will ever happen
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.720]   to you except as God has designed it.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.560]   Now if those two biblical premises stand, one, you are created by God down to the very
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.280]   atoms and molecules of your DNA, and two, all your experiences are planned by God down
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.320]   to the slightest breeze that blows a strand of your hair, then what you are in all your
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.160]   physical, psychological, relational, spiritual peculiarities are owing to God.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.240]   It's owing to God.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.640]   Then you take those two truths and think about their implications.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.480]   This is why I said it's not a direct teaching, it's an implication.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.080]   The Bible tells us to do that kind of thinking, 2 Timothy 2.7.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.960]   Think over what I say and the Lord will give you understanding.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.800]   And when you think about those two realities, you realize nobody, absolutely nobody has
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.580]   had your experiences.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.960]   They have had similar experiences, but not your experiences.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:32.880]   You have had millions of experiences, tiny and huge, lasting one second and lasting a
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.860]   year, conscious, unconscious, and all of them shape you.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.560]   Every day we are being shaped by what we experience.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.400]   Pathways in our brains are being laid down.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:54.160]   Data is being stored and nobody, absolutely nobody in the world has the same collection
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160]   of millions of shaping experiences as you have.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Similar?
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   Yes.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   The same?
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   Never.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.800]   You are the only person who can have your experiences.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:15.040]   Therefore you are the only you in the world and in history, history, all of it.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:24.040]   And since God is the creator of the experiencer in the womb and the governor of the experiences
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:30.960]   in life, the unique you is you by God's design.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.240]   You are not random.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.480]   You're not a sample of humanity.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.680]   You are you by God's creating and providential design.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:47.200]   And the reason that matters is that the Bible teaches that everything, including every individual,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   exists for the glory of Christ and the glory of God.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:59.600]   Colossians 1.16, "All things were created through Christ and for Christ, for Christ,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   for his glory."
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.040]   Romans 11.36, "From him, from God, through him, to him, are all things, to him, all things,
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.400]   to him, to his glory, all things."
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:20.240]   This means that the person you are, with all the uniquenesses of your genetic makeup and
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   all your experiences, exists for the glory of Christ and the glory of God.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:33.600]   You are like a prism shaped like no other prism in the world, so that when the light
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:42.080]   of God shines on you, there is a kind of refraction, a combination of colors, so to speak, that
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.060]   only you can refract.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.320]   And that's why you matter.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:57.120]   Your life, devoted to God, reflects his glory in a way no other life can.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.640]   Similar?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.480]   Yes, but not the same.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.760]   Your uniqueness devoted to Christ is a glory to Christ unlike any other.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.240]   As I have searched the scriptures looking for a more explicit statement about our uniqueness
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.640]   individually, the closest I have been able to come is Revelations 2.17, where Jesus says
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:31.440]   this, "To the one who conquers, I will give him a white stone with a new name written
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:39.280]   on it that no one knows except the one who receives it."
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:48.400]   Now I can't prove that the name written on your stone, Demetri, will be different from
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.520]   the name written on all the other believers' stones.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.920]   The text doesn't say that.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.680]   But here's what it does say, and this is what I was referring to way back at the beginning
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.400]   when I said that we would close on something more important than our unique existence.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.740]   Revelation 2.17 does say that there is a unique attentiveness that Christ gives to every one
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:24.560]   of his people, a uniquely personal relationship, because he says, "Nobody knows your name except
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.320]   me and you."
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.600]   In other words, he turns our attention away from the uniqueness of our name to the uniqueness
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.680]   of our relationship with him.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:45.120]   Whatever your name—and I do think it's unique, by the way—only Christ knows it and relates
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.160]   to you personally with it.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:57.840]   So I would encourage Demetri and all of us, devote the uniqueness of your existence to
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   the glory of Christ and treasure the uniqueness of Christ's attentiveness above your unique
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.900]   existence.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.600]   Really well put together case, Pastor John.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.960]   Thank you for thinking through it.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.720]   And Demetri, great question.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.280]   Thanks for sending it in.
