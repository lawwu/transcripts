[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.200]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.880]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I am your host.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.240]   This is a special edition of the show recorded to be here
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.720]   while I am on the road traveling for a couple of weeks here in September.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.640]   Wanted to make sure I didn't leave you without a show.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.000]   If this is your first time hearing the Radical Personal Finance podcast,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.120]   I hope you enjoy the content today, but please check out the archives
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.040]   for the more normal.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.520]   Variety that we bring on the show
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.880]   and the more standard format that we tend to stick with today,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.680]   I'd like to share with you a couple of ideas around the importance
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.600]   of tracking your money.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.280]   I often am asked, Joshua, where should I start
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.760]   when it comes to financial planning?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   And number one place to start, I believe, is generally with
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.800]   what do you want out of life?
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.240]   Where do you want to go?
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.760]   What are you trying to do?
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.360]   And that really is the first place to start.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.840]   That's not just some idea that sounds namby pamby that you make up.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.880]   No, it really is a very important step.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.480]   What do you want?
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.840]   Because that's what's going to drive the entire financial plan.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.520]   The clearer you are on that, the easier it is.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.080]   So if that's step one, though, there is, however, a step about
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   we'll call it one point one and one point one is tracking.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.680]   The strength of your financial plan is going to be based upon
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.840]   the accuracy of your data.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.280]   If I were doing a financial plan for a client, there is a dramatic difference
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.120]   between somebody needing four thousand dollars a month of living expenses
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.240]   versus someone needing four thousand eight hundred dollars a month
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.880]   of living expenses, and you insert whatever number you want.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.360]   But there's a dramatic difference in the financial plan
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.080]   because of those numbers in many ways.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.160]   So it's very important to have accurate data,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   and it is very difficult for me to conceive of somebody
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.320]   being very financially successful and having an excellent financial plan
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.120]   that doesn't have at least some general idea
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   of what their actual expenditures are.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.360]   It's very important.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.760]   So I'm going to encourage you, if you don't track your money,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.000]   establish a system that works for you to track your money.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.640]   Now, this system should, well, can and probably should vary
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   depending on where you're at in your financial stages of life.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   For example, if you are deeply in debt, just getting started,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.960]   working your way for the first time through a financial plan,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.880]   it's probably very important to be very tangible with your expenses
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.200]   so that you really feel them and understand each and every one of them
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   to be very specific while tracking them
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.360]   so that you have each and every one of them spelled out.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.720]   And very, very detailed.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.760]   However, if you are wealthy and have a substantial amount of income
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.720]   and you're living well within your means,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040]   it's probably necessary only to have a more general idea
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.960]   of the amounts and the totals for some categories.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   So a much looser system of tracking may be appropriate.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.560]   But it's hard to imagine being able to have success
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.320]   without any system of tracking.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.440]   So if you've never sat down and designed for yourself
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.880]   a system of tracking your money, consider doing so.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.960]   And I'll give you a couple of suggestions.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.680]   Try to be as simple as possible.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.480]   Simplicity really does count.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.840]   I am the king of making things complex.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.960]   I have really messed this up so many times
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.400]   of going for a complex solution when simple is all that's required.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.160]   An old-fashioned notebook and a pen
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   and maybe a three by five card carried around in your pocket,
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.200]   a lot of times that can be a much better solution for you.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Then the fanciest app that you can find for your phone.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.960]   The app gets in the way a lot of times.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.040]   Now, I'd also suggest to you that you design a system
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.880]   that's appropriate for what you already have.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.920]   We can talk at some point about ways that you would want to change
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.440]   your tracking system or change your system of accounts.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.840]   But just look at what you have and figure out an easy way to track it.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.760]   So, for example, do you mainly use a checking account?
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.720]   If you mainly use a checking account and use a debit card maybe
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   and some checks and some ATM withdrawals,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.120]   then probably the best way to track your money
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.320]   would just be by keeping your check register current.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.080]   I really believe, and I've worked with some younger clients
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.720]   who've never kept the check register in their life
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.240]   and kind of taught them how to keep a check register.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.120]   And it's amazing the power of a simple check register.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.080]   By the way, the reason that it's so powerful
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   is because you can easily put into the check register
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.880]   forward-looking transactions and backward-looking transactions.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.480]   It's incredibly powerful.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.400]   You can't do that very easily with the software solutions.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.520]   It's a lot easier with the checkbook register.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.600]   But that may work really well for you.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.240]   Now, if you're in the habit of using five different credit cards,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   one of which has the biggest rebate on fuel, so you use that one,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.040]   and then the other one which gives you a 5% target discount,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.520]   so you use the Target card and the Home Depot card and all of that,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.960]   well, now it may be much more challenging for you
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.800]   to use a simple checkbook register.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   So now you might want to look for some sort of electronic solution.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.560]   Electronic solution might be maybe an app like a Mint,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320]   Mint.com or a Mint app.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.960]   They're the most famous, but there are many of them.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.320]   Just search in your whatever your phone is
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   or just search for some kind of app option
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.880]   and see which one stands out to you.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   There's tons of them out there.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.680]   Now, on the other hand, let's say that you are someone
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.160]   who is very much a user of cash
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.280]   and you always spend cash because you like to either,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.080]   whether it's part of your budgeting strategy
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.840]   or because you just like carrying cash.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.960]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.560]   Well, in this case, maybe the three by five card method might be best
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.760]   and maybe a notebook at home.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.640]   So you write in the three by five card when you spend the money
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.360]   and every day you just record that in a notebook.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.120]   At some way, you just need to collect the data.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.520]   Now, I'm intentionally, again, trying not to be too prescriptive
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.920]   with what you need to do,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.160]   but sit down and design for yourself a system.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.920]   Again, if you were just getting started,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.720]   those solutions might work well.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.800]   If you are a wealthy and you just said,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.360]   "Hey, I've got plenty of money and I'm living within my means,"
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.280]   maybe you just put everything on your Amex
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   and at the end of the year, you take the report from your Amex.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.480]   They will categorize out the expenses for you automatically.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.640]   You take a look at those categories of expenses
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.560]   and combine those with your standard household bills.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   That's fine too.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.760]   I'm not trying to get into here a budgeting discussion.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.520]   I view budgeting as different than money tracking.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.640]   Budgeting is a forward-looking thing.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.600]   Money tracking is a backward-looking thing.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.800]   In one way, money tracking is useless
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.840]   because it doesn't affect forward-looking behavior.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.600]   Money tracking is just all about having accurate data
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.240]   and budgeting is all about adjusting future decisions.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.920]   Both are important, but they're important in different ways.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.160]   People, I think, get those things mixed up a lot of times.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.160]   So sit down, consider some detailed tracking method
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   that will work for you.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.000]   I would encourage you that it's not that much more difficult
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.200]   to make your system very precise than just to make it generalized.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.360]   If you'll just take what you do and look at it,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.040]   it's not really that tough to make most systems very precise
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.640]   and the extra degree of precision will allow you
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.760]   to feel much more confident with your financial decisions.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   I think that's about all I want to share for today.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.560]   I'm intentionally trying not to say, "Here's what you must do,"
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.160]   but rather just encourage you,
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.880]   set up some kind of system for yourself.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.680]   Good project for today.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.800]   And I guess I would add this last thing.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.000]   Expect your system to change over time.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.960]   My system changes continually and I think that's okay.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.680]   I do that myself. I think that's okay.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.120]   The reason it changes is because I go through ebbs and flows
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   of my financial life.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.440]   So, for example, if I'm working very hard at a specific financial goal,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.880]   at that point in time, I want to be really intense about my tracking
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.560]   and I want to be really proactive with a forward-looking information
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.000]   and a budgeting system.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.240]   So, if I'm in financial distress or if the income is tight
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.760]   and the expenses are high,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.560]   then I'm going to make sure that I'm very carefully watching every dollar.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.880]   And so, when I've gotten out of debt a couple of times in the past,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.320]   when I've gotten out of debt,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.760]   I've switched everything to manual payments.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.800]   I don't do anything as automatic payments.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.200]   I cut everything off of just normal billing
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.080]   and everything becomes manual.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.400]   And then I take full control back over.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.520]   And so now every single thing gets a paper check written,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.240]   everything gets dollars paid,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   you get the careful checkbook register,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.800]   careful manual accounting systems, etc.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.720]   That can work really great for a time,
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   but then it becomes heavy over time.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.040]   And so there may be a time I've changed over from that system
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.440]   to more automated systems,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.360]   where once you have good income coming in,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   it's more reliable and more predictable,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.800]   then you can set that up and that's coming in regularly into account,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.320]   you can set up automatic drafts,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.000]   and that smooths life out quite a bit.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.280]   But it's hard, it's easy to lose control of that.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.960]   And depending on the complicated nature of the system,
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.360]   it needs to change over time.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.080]   So I've done it a few different ways.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.080]   I've made a lot of mistakes in what I'm doing it,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.560]   and ways I've done it.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.760]   I guess the key thing I would say is, again,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.280]   design a system that works for you,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.080]   and then follow through and try it.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.480]   Don't be scared to change it,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.880]   but track that info,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.840]   because you need that info to be able to make good decisions.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.120]   Thanks so much for listening.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.440]   I hope this was helpful for you.
