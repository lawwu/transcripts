[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And the bad times are back again
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.220]   with the S&P 500 below 3,700. So it's down more than 20% from its high. The NASDAQ is
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:22.280]   closer to down 30% from its high, around 10,600. And the Dow is below 30,000. Now, obviously,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.800]   things don't feel great right now. Although the consumer continues to be spending, traffic
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.360]   continues to be high, travel continues to be high. And I think that's a product of revenge
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.200]   spending and people just cooped up and they want to spend their money and get on with
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   their lives, right? But I think with a 70-80% probability, a recession is coming over the
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.920]   next 12 months. And we actually might already be in one. We could. The first quarter GDP
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   was down. Why can't the second quarter GDP be down as well? What's also concerning is
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.500]   that the Federal Reserve will likely continue to hike the Fed funds rate well into a recession.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.680]   So it's really hard to stop once you've telegraphed you're going to start. And it's really hard
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.280]   to stop exactly at the point, the tipping point. It's kind of like skating to where
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.680]   the puck is going. You've got to ease into that spot. Or it's kind of like snowboarding
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.520]   and going really fast downhill. You've got to ease into that slide to get to the exact
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.840]   point. And more often than not, we tend to overshoot a little bit. And that's probably
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.480]   what's going to happen. The Fed is probably going to overshoot on their rate hikes after
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.560]   we already go into recession, after there's a ton of job losses, after the market has
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.240]   really given up a lot of its gains. And that's just the way it is. But if you've been reading
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.680]   Financial Samurai for a while and you've been listening to this podcast for a while, we're
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.600]   all about trying to forecast our misery to be happier and to forecast our future so we
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   can look ahead and be ahead of the curve. We're definitely not always going to get it
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.240]   right. We're probably not going to get it right much more than 55, 60 percent of the
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.900]   time. If you've got a 55 percent to 60 percent hit rate in terms of investing, you're going
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.440]   to crush it over the long term. But hopefully we have our proper asset allocation for our
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.240]   net worth. We're not over leveraged. We're not on margin. We don't have too much debt.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.000]   And we're just taking our punches as we go down as we've experienced the glory of going
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.800]   up. Now, in this episode, I want to talk about one of the biggest benefits of being in a
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.120]   bear market. And this benefit really changed my life for the better. So back in 2012, I
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.560]   did leave my day job behind, partly because I saw the return on effort decline. No longer
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.080]   was working hard at my day job going to provide me the wealth that I wanted, the income that
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.720]   I wanted. No longer was working hard going to guarantee me the next promotion. Right.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.880]   So when you're working, you're obviously want a raise and a promotion. And if you're going
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.920]   to work hard and not get that, well, then why bother? So the best thing about the bear
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.780]   market is that it allows you to look at what really, really matters. If money was stripped
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.760]   out of the equation, are you doing what you are doing because you enjoy it or because
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.440]   you need the job to survive? Now, obviously, it's going to be a combination, hopefully,
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.280]   of both. But I think a lot of us, if we're really honest with ourselves, especially if
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.440]   we're working at the same job for 5, 10, 15, 20 plus years, we probably don't love our
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.160]   job as we once did. And if that's the case, and if money is hard to come by, which it
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.760]   is now, what would you do differently? And so my answer to that was, I wouldn't work
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.920]   in the money industry. Because one, it's hard to make money. And two, if you spend your
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.560]   entire life focused on trying to make money and make other people money and other institutions
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.320]   money, eventually, that's going to feel pretty soul sucking. And so what I did was, I decided
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.400]   to focus more on Financial Samurai, which is obviously a personal finance site to help
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.000]   people build wealth, but also do more of what they want and live the lives that they want
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.040]   to live. But since I left in 2012, there have also been plenty of ups and downs. And I talk
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.160]   about this in one of the posts, 10 years of fake retirement later, here are the most important
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.560]   lessons learned. So even after I've stepped away, you would think life would be much more
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:49.760]   relaxing. But it's really a self imposed discipline that you need to exercise to feel relaxed.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.960]   Because when you're on your own, you've got to motivate yourself to get better to provide
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.080]   for your family and so forth. So now that the bear market has returned, I'm actually
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   looking forward to taking things down a notch sometime around August or September of 2022.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.200]   It's been a really difficult time since 2020. When the pandemic started, to stay at home
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.580]   children, writing, managing everything, it's a lot of work. And I think a lot of working
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.320]   parents can empathize with this time period. And so if things are not doing well right
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.520]   now, if the stock market is going down, if the real estate market is going to start to
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.560]   fade, then the main thing you can do is really budget your finances, well, save cash, stack
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.480]   that cash and wait for better opportunities over the horizon. Because these downturns
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:48.000]   can last one to three years easily. The average bear market lasts about 12 months and has
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.280]   a 35% drawdown. We're now about five months into this bear market, and we've drawn down
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:02.640]   a little over 20%. So in a way, you can see the next eight months mentally, as a time
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.600]   to relax, to rejuvenate, to think about the things that matter most. At the same time,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.160]   if you need that money, that financial security, then it's important for you to be strategic
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.120]   right now, by developing those relationships that matter by checking in on those people
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   who actually have control over your future, so that you don't get let go during the next
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.840]   round of layoffs. I believe the time to spend your money, if you have the money, is during
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.320]   a bear market because that can help soften the blow. And the time to work hard and to
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.560]   grind is during a bull market, because that is when you can get the highest return on
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.240]   your effort. So if you're feeling burned out, as I'm feeling burned out, take this bear
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.400]   market as a positive signal, as a pause on your journey to financial independence, as
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:04.160]   a break time, as a three-day rest period between the games and an NBA final series. Eventually,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.960]   the good times will return again. And when they do, I hope everyone is well rested, well
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.480]   planned and well positioned to benefit. Thanks so much for listening, everyone. I'm still
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.440]   busy promoting my book, Buy This, Not That, How to Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.600]   It comes out July 19th, 2022. And I really thank you for pre-ordering a hard copy of
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.160]   my book. And shout out to various podcasts, including Adulting is Easy, Crazy Money, Tropical
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:42.560]   NBA, Yelp, Google, the William & Mary Finance Club and so forth for listening to me speak.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.400]   It's been a real pleasure and it's been really fun to talk about all the chapters and all
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.840]   the dilemmas in the book. So if you're interested in having me speak to your company or to your
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.400]   organization, just shoot me an email and let me know what your proposal is. And I'll probably
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   take you up on your offer. Take care.
