[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420]   Hello, I'm here with Eric at the LSB dinner celebration. Eric, can you
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.880]   introduce yourself? Hi, I'm Eric Dodson. I'm a pastor in Elgin, Texas, Grace
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.040]   Communion Baptist Church. Love the LSB, so happy to be here. All right, great. And
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.320]   Eric, you've been reading through the LSB. Can you just tell us a little bit about
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.020]   your experience? Yeah, so at our church, we use a different translation for
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.760]   preaching, but I cross-reference with the LSB for study, and often I find starting
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.120]   from the original languages, I want to say something just a little different
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.520]   than the version I use in the pulpit, and it's almost always consistent with the
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.140]   LSB. It's always like they've got it the way I would say it, and so it's
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.840]   always an encouraging read and just a blessing to have added to my study. All
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.160]   right, thanks Eric for being with us tonight. Thank you.
