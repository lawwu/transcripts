[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Alright, so let's move on now to some questions about deep work.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Our first question comes from Brendan.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Brendan asks, "Are you familiar with Patrick Liccioni's working genius model?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And if so, how might someone's working geniuses be best suited to deep work and time block planning
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   and which types may have to work harder at it?"
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Well, Brendan, I don't know this particular framework from Patrick.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I have actually met Patrick before.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   We were both speaking at the same conference that was outside of Dallas.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   This would have been maybe four or five years ago, and we had lunch together.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Fascinating guy, great writer, sells a ton of books, by the way.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   He really has his finger on the pulse of the business market.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I don't know working genius, but I know the general type of book you're talking about here.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   These are books in which you try to discern something about you as your personality or as a worker.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So you talk about in your elaboration here that your "geniuses" in Liccioni's framework are discernment and tenacity.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And you're trying to ask, are there going to be some of these personality or worker types
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   that are better suited for some of this advice than others?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Generally what I like to say, because I encounter this a lot,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   is that deep work and time-block planning are universal.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So in other words, regardless of what your personality or genius type is,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   the fact remains that if your brain is focusing on one thing at a time without context switching,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   it's going to produce better output than if it's context switching,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   than if you're kind of working and you're kind of distracted.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It doesn't matter if your genius is discernment or tenacity or whatever else they are.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   With time-block planning, the same thing holds.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   If you give every minute of your day a job, so you are intentional about,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   "Here is the time that's available. What do I want to do with it?"
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You are going to be better off, you're going to produce more, you're going to be less stressed,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   less will get forgotten, than if you're instead just reactive and say, "What do I want to do next?"
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So I don't believe there's a personality type for which deep work is not relevant.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I don't believe there's a personality type for which time-block planning is not going to help.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Now that being said, how much deep work you do,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   how much work you have in your life that requires deep work,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   how you set up and structure that deep work,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   what blocks you're putting into your time-block plan,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   whether the time-block plan is very tight, meaning that you have lots of blocks precisely timed,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   or very loose where you have really large blocks and maybe buffer blocks to give yourself room
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   if something takes longer than something else,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   all of that could be affected by you and your particular personality.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So let's make the underlying idea that deep work produces higher quality and quantity than shallow work.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Let's take the underlying idea that intention about your time is going to be much better
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   than being random, haphazard, or reactive, and say that's universal.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   But your style for applying those ideas, I think it's completely fine to think that that style might differ.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And your style might be someone who really needs five hours in a cave,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   don't bother me doing deep work, or your style might be, this is like pulling teeth,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   it's two hours, it has to be first thing in the morning before other things get going.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That's fine. That's stylistic. Your style with your time-block plan might be very tight.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I want to be like an assembly line rolling through a lot of things incredibly effectively,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   or it might be like we talked about, very loose. And I think that's fine too.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So we have universal ideas, individualistic, however, applications of those ideas to your working life.
