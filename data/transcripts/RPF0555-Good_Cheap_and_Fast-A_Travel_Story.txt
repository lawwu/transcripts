Think of the sign that you've no doubt seen in your mechanic shop that says you can have your work done good, you can have your work done fast, or you can have your work done cheap. Now, I love that sign because I think it expresses a truth, especially a truth as relates to really any kind of serving.

One other point of introduction here though on good fast and cheap. I modified this a little bit when I'm buying things. So I don't think you have to choose between good fast and cheap when buying things. I think you can find good. I think you can find fast. I think you could find cheap. The way I modify it

And I took time to fix the things that were wrong with it over time. And that was where we were. I bought the truck, bought the camper, etc. And the truck, everything was ready. And once I found the truck, the other thing that I found was I put a big topper on it. I had a big giant aluminum commercial topper on the back that I had shopped for and I got a great deal on. And that gave me lots of cargo space for all of the trucks.

The insurance company totaled the vehicle. But it was also, I felt like it was largely cosmetic and I figured well, so I'm willing to drive an ugly vehicle this could work out. I'll take a check from the insurance company I'll drive the vehicle with a salvage title and we'll just head out across the country. Well, on Monday morning I came across the vehicle.

So what I've often found with used vehicles, you need to go and look at them. You need to drive them at least a little bit. And you can start to develop an understanding of the marketplace. When you look at one that's $15,000, and you look at another that's $7,500, and you look at one with 300,000 miles, and you look at one with 150,000 miles, you can start to understand the demand for these vehicles. You can talk with

[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.940]   spend the next few days cleaning it up. That's what occupied all of last week,
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.980]   but clean the truck up, did a bunch of mechanical stuff, change of fluids,
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.340]   change of bearings. And, you know, I had my fingers deep in Greece,
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.940]   just getting everything ready to go on the road, but thankfully didn't need much.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.220]   And hooked it up and went. Now here'd be the flip side.

But our traveling season and the time of year has gotten constrained because of our late start. And I'll tell you what, last week was tough. I was tired. I've done the best I could, but a lot of things have suffered. My business has suffered. I've had some unhappy clients, unhappy emails, and I haven't released a show in a little while.
