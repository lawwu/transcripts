[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.560]   I am your host and I am your fellow financial freedom fighter working with you and sharing
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.560]   some of my own journey on this quest towards financial independence, hoping to help you,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.280]   to teach you, to encourage you, and also just to share from my own adventures along the
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280]   way.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   Thrilled to report to you that I am broadcasting from on the road, officially out of the state
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.760]   of Florida.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.320]   My family and I are officially into our long-term full-time RV trip around the United States
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.480]   and what a past few weeks it has been.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   It has been quite the adventure.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.120]   But one of the very important principles under which I create Radical Personal Finance is
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.080]   to share with you the good, the bad, the challenging, etc.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.880]   I have never hidden from you really anything.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.280]   I have never tried to create a facade of any sort.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.360]   I've tried to share with you very transparently and forthrightly a little bit about my own
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   journey because for me, Radical Personal Finance has been both a professional endeavor and
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.480]   a personal journey.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.520]   It's been a personal tool.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.760]   It's been really a personal hobby and I'm very grateful to be able to share that with
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   you.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.880]   So today, I will primarily share a narrative with you, a little bit of the story of especially
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.280]   the last few weeks as we have set out and faced big challenges in getting out the door
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.520]   on our own financial, on our own trip, kind of the fulfillment of us living our rich life
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.560]   now while also working towards and continuing to trot down the plan for financial freedom
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.240]   in 10 years or less.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.160]   And so today, that relates to our travels.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.320]   On the most recent show, I shared with you that a week before we were scheduled to leave
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.120]   or excuse me, five days before we were scheduled to leave on our full-time RV trip, when we
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.640]   were mostly moved out of an apartment and told our landlord when we were out and we
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.560]   were mostly moved into a travel trailer and really had no stuff, all of a sudden, our
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.880]   tow vehicle, our pickup truck was stolen and wound up in really a serious shape.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.480]   And so that has been quite the wrinkle and it has utterly consumed the last two weeks.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   So thank you for your patience with me.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.640]   Thank you also for patience over the coming months.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   You're going to hear me broadcasting from many locations.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.280]   It is extremely challenging to find a place to work when you're on the road and when you
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   record audio.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.040]   I've done my very best to have top of the line equipment and to find quiet places, but
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   thank you for your patience.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.960]   You're going to hear me, you're going to hear all kinds of funny things in the background.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.200]   Today, I worked and worked and right when I'm ready to record, the wood chipper started
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   it up.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.240]   So there's a wood chipper in the background.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.800]   So to the story as to how we've actually gotten on the road, I want to share the story with
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.760]   you and I want to also use it as a loose way of discussing a principle that I practice
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.780]   when I try to break the model of good, fast and cheap.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.960]   Think of the sign that you've no doubt seen in your mechanic shop that says you can have
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.840]   your work done good, you can have your work done fast, or you can have your work done
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   cheap.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.040]   Now, I love that sign because I think it expresses a truth, especially a truth as relates to
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.440]   really any kind of service that you are purchasing.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.400]   Good, fast, cheap, pick two.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.520]   You can get two of them, but you can't get all three.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.320]   And I think one of the basics of finance is to recognize where you are in that triangle.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.920]   Which two do you really need and doing your best to always keep cheap in the mix.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   Because the more you pay, really, the more it costs you.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.560]   And in general, any time you can lower your expenses, the better.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.220]   So that means that you have to play with either the good, and I think that's really problematic
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.320]   when buying things or services, or you have to play with the fast.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.800]   And I think that's usually the best thing to play with.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.880]   But I tell you what, I've had my back up against the wall last week.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.240]   When you are a father of three small children, all under the just a few years old, and you
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.120]   have two dogs and your family has moved out of an apartment, but not really moved into
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.160]   a trailer and that trailer is sitting in your driveway and you really it's not livable,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.720]   you don't really have any amenities hooked up to it.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.040]   It's just in it's stuck there and you don't have a vehicle to pull it with and all of
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   a sudden you got to move fast to solve the problem.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.320]   So I'm going to share that story with you.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.120]   One other point of introduction here though on good, fast and cheap.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.440]   I modify this a little bit when I'm buying things.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.940]   So I don't think you have to choose between good, fast and cheap when buying things.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.720]   I think you can find good.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   I think you can find fast.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   I think you can find cheap.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:34.120]   The way I modify it when buying things is you can have fast, cheap or exactly what you
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   want.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.440]   Something unique, something specific.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.760]   Because if you're willing to lower your standards or lower your discrimination among
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.440]   certain items and be willing to accept a broader range of choices, you have more buying options.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.400]   So I'll share with you a little bit of the story because I think this will be similar
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.680]   to what you'll face whenever you're trying to work towards something unusual, when you're
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.560]   trying to work towards something radical and also keep money under control.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.080]   Because I'll tell you what, if I start to get money out of control, it's tough for me
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   to feel at peace.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.640]   It's tough for me to feel content if the money is out of control.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.080]   But sometimes you commit yourself to a course of action and all of a sudden you're sucked
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   in deep and you feel like just the money is quickly spinning out of control.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   It's what many, many people face.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.480]   And so I'll share the story with you.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.800]   The concept of the RV trip goes back a long ways and it wasn't something that we wanted
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.380]   to do super important to us because of a long-held plan or a long-held dream.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.120]   It was something that just seemed like a really good move for our next step.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.720]   And we don't know how long we're going to be on the road.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.800]   We tell people six months, it may be shorter, it may be longer, we don't know.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   But we just thought it seemed like the best next move for us and allows us to travel the
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.040]   country, to visit with you, to do all kinds of cool things in the coming months.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.400]   And so we've been pretty excited about it.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.560]   We've been actively planning towards it for about a year.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.960]   Now when I have a goal and I know that goal is going to require a lot of money, specifically
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.600]   you've got to buy a rig, set everything up, then I try to be as forward planning as possible.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.120]   I try to look through the options because I really want to have something cheap and
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.340]   I want to have something good.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.080]   And so I figured the easiest factor for me to control is to control the speed.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.360]   And let me be willing to move slowly because if I can plan ahead by having long range thinking,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.160]   then I can move slowly and I can get good and cheap.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.220]   That's how I usually try to solve that.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:42.800]   As I figure the best thing for me to move is to move slowly and I can get good and cheap.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.960]   So we started the process of putting together our traveling rig, our full-time RV.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.140]   Now I've long had a desire and a goal of owning an RV and my wife and I, we bought one a number
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.040]   of years ago and the first one we bought was a Class B van camper.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.000]   I love Class B campers.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.040]   I think they're really one of the best options for people to consider.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.660]   If you're unfamiliar with the lingo of the RV world, a Class B camper is basically a
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.760]   van that has all the camper stuff in it.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.560]   And by a van, I mean a van.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.320]   It has metal walls just like a van.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.520]   Now these have gotten longer over the years, they've gotten taller over the years, but
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.720]   if you can buy it as an empty shell of a van, the kind of van that a workman might drive,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.880]   and then turn it into an RV, it's a Class B camper.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.080]   Here's what's wonderful about Class B campers.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.520]   They're small and that means they're nimble.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.640]   They're versatile.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.280]   Now in the world of RVing, bigger is not always better.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.640]   When I was younger, I would look at the huge rigs, the big buses and the big giant campers
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.980]   and I would think, "Oh, they are so awesome."
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.000]   And they are awesome for certain applications.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.560]   But for applications like I want to use, I want to be nimble, I want to be versatile.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.680]   For example, you start getting a rig that's much over 30 feet and it becomes hard to fit
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.680]   into a lot of national parks, state parks, small little campgrounds.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:10.240]   If you have a big giant bus, it'll be so comfortable while you're sitting in a big parking lot.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.680]   But that's about the only place it can go.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.920]   It can't go into a little campground.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.180]   It can't whip into a little side street, little back alley that looks interesting in a city
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.720]   while you're exploring.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.760]   And so we loved the Class B camper.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   We had a lot of fun in it.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.960]   We traveled and we loved the travel of it.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.080]   You can park in any standard parking space, which means that you don't have any size restrictions
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.820]   and yet you have most of the comforts of home.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.280]   You have to be a little versatile and having all those comforts at once because it's a
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.380]   small vehicle, but you have all the comforts at home.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.140]   But we frankly just outgrew it.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.980]   We took a trip with two children, two dogs, two parents, but that was about the limit.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.740]   We decided that we couldn't handle a third child in that rig.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.120]   And specifically the problem was car seats, where to put car seats at night.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:00.760]   Car seats take up so much room and yet you can't just stick them outside very well and
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.040]   taking them up and putting them down was a real hassle.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.800]   So we decided, okay, next step is I want to have a tow vehicle that the car seats can
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.340]   stay strapped in full time.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.720]   And so I thought, well, you know, I'm Joshua.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   I'm Joshua Sheets.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.200]   I'm, I'm a radical planner.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.940]   So what's the best move?
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.780]   What I decided the best move was, was to buy a full size van.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.300]   And here was my theory.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.720]   Full size vans have a huge amount of interior space, which is wonderful when traveling with
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.760]   children.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.560]   If you traveled with small children or if you are a small child, you can understand
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.780]   that traveling long car rides with small children is not the easiest thing in the world.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.200]   And it's made a lot easier if you can have a few amenities such as a little bit of space
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.980]   for attending to bathroom needs, such as a little bit of space for attending to food
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.880]   needs, a little bit of space for attending to entertainment needs, et cetera.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.960]   So I decided that a full size van could be fixed up to provide many of the amenities
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.560]   of traveling in an actual motor home.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   You could remove one of the seats.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.960]   You could have lots of space so the kids could get up and down.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.040]   You could have a small portable potty in the car for them to use.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.440]   You could have a cooler with snacks.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.240]   You could have plenty of space for things.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.000]   There'd be space for mom and dad, space for the children, space for the dogs, and plenty
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.360]   of space for cargo if I got a big 15 passenger van.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.720]   Also, 15 passenger vans, especially certain brands, are rated well for good towing numbers.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.960]   You could tow a 10,000 pound trailer.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.640]   And 10,000 pounds is a really workable number for a bumper pull travel trailer.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.240]   You can find almost any trailer for under that.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.080]   And then also, I thought this was the best.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.840]   This is great because it's going to be financially a real bargain.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.100]   I consider full size vans to be a wonderful bargain in the world of tow vehicles.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.200]   If you look and analyze the marketplace, pickup trucks are in huge demand as tow vehicles
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.680]   and as just personal vehicles.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.220]   People love pickup trucks.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.600]   So because they love them, they're willing to pay a lot of money for them, which means
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   it's hard to find them cheap, especially good ones.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.920]   Same thing with SUVs.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.200]   Most SUVs are in huge demand, so it's hard to find them cheap, good ones.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.000]   But full size vans are really built like trucks, especially the older ones that have the body
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.480]   on frame design.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   They're built like trucks.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.000]   They're strong and they're cheap.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.360]   Nobody really wants them.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.280]   The only people that want them are commercial companies.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.480]   Most families don't want them.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.160]   They just, what am I going to do with them?
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.720]   So they're cheap to buy.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.960]   And so I thought I've got the perfect solution.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.640]   We bought a full size van and I was tickled pink.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.200]   I only paid a couple thousand bucks for it.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.040]   It had 190,000 miles, had a Chevy 350 V8.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.120]   I was happy as a ubiquitous engine, very inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to maintain.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120]   Parts are everywhere.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.160]   One of the most common engines on the road, especially in the past.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.400]   And so I just thought this is going to be wonderful.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.120]   Well, unfortunately, when we poked up the camper, I couldn't get the thing over 51 miles
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   an hour.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.680]   Now, I don't know what the problem was.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.320]   In the beginning, I thought it was an engine problem.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.800]   The engine should have been able to do it.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.120]   It really should have.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.660]   So I did have some engine problems that I didn't find in the process of buying it.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.660]   That was my fault.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.400]   I did a bad job buying it.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.560]   And then I also had some other problems.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.640]   So I wound up sinking several thousand dollars into the thing, which annoyed me because all
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.320]   of a sudden my great deal didn't turn out to be such a great deal.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.040]   I think probably the major problem was gearing.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.640]   The truck wasn't geared well for towing.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.220]   And I just was at that point, I was in it so deep, I just cut my losses and sold the
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.520]   vehicle and decided to move on.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520]   But I still had plenty of time.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.880]   It was very early.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.720]   This was a long time ago.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.060]   And again, trying to buy good and cheap and giving up fast.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.320]   So I switched to diesel pickup trucks.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.000]   And I chose to buy, I was shopping for something that was between a 1999 and a 2002 Ford Super
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.600]   Duty diesel pickup trucks.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.020]   That would be either an F-250 or F-350.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   And back to selection.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.800]   Now, when I'm buying something, I try to figure out what do I have to have?
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.520]   Because if you, even if you got to spend twice what you'd like to spend, at least if you
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.840]   get what you have to have, you won't waste your money.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.140]   You will waste your money if you don't get what you have to have.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.080]   So whatever your minimum requirements are, you've got to meet those.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.360]   But if you can be flexible on anything else, it'll open up the market for you.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.400]   If you have to have a certain make, a certain model, a certain color, and certain amenities,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.160]   well, because your selection, remember I'm inserting the word selection for good here,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.540]   very, very careful selection.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.160]   Because your selection is so specific, you're probably going to have to budge either on
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.600]   moving fast, you got to wait a long time to find it, or you're probably going to have
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.400]   to budge on moving cheap.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:41.560]   So I think that if I'm trying to maneuver through this triangle, if I'm willing to take
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.800]   a long time, and if I'm willing to be fairly liberal in the types of things that I can
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.900]   accept, I can get a cheaper deal.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.960]   So with a pickup truck, my minimum requirements were very simple.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.220]   I decided I was going to go with a pickup truck.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.560]   It needed to be a crew cab because I needed space for my family, and it needed to be diesel.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.120]   It needed to be this specific diesel engine.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.600]   Now that second one may not have actually been required.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.200]   For example, Ford produces a V10 engine that for those years was a great engine, and it
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.600]   probably could do the job.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.040]   But because I'd been burned, I was feeling a little gun shy, and I felt like I just can't
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.240]   take the risk again.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.080]   I don't want to go through this again.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.560]   Our departure date is starting to move up on me.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.880]   I need to just buy what I know will work, even if I have to pay a little bit more for
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   it.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.520]   But beyond that, I was totally open to anything.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.960]   It had to be a crew cab, it had to be a crew cab, and it had to be a diesel, and it had
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.620]   to be a crew cab with a bench seat in the front, or one that I could swap out.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:42.960]   So I honed in on those years of the Ford 7.3 liter diesel engines.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.840]   Those are the best engines that are inexpensive, and they basically do the job, and they have
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.880]   the least problems.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.040]   Now they have their own set of problems.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.200]   They're not as quiet, they're not as comfortable, they're not as powerful as some of the more
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   modern ones.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   But at the end of the day, a diesel pickup truck is going to get you 10 miles a gallon,
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.520]   pulling you down the road whether it's brand new or whether it's 20 years old.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.000]   So a lot of that stuff, I don't really see the point of it.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.200]   It's just got to have the power to get the trailer over the mountain.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.640]   So I found a great truck.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.160]   It was a great truck.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.640]   Basically it was owned within a single family for all of its history, owned since new, got
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.320]   a good deal on it, everything was good.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.240]   And I took time to fix the things that were wrong with it over time, and that was where
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   we were.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.160]   I bought the truck, bought the camper, etc.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.640]   And the truck, everything was ready.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.600]   And once I found the truck, the other thing that I found was I put a big topper on it.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   I had a big giant aluminum commercial topper on the back that I had shopped for and I got
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.120]   a great deal on.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:46.240]   And that gave me lots of cargo space for all of the traveling things, until it got stolen.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.880]   And so the story of the theft was a little bit weird because it got stolen, but I actually
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.120]   found it the same morning that I found out about it being stolen.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.320]   And I don't care to go into all those details, but I went looking for the truck and I actually
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.040]   found it, but unfortunately it wound up being pretty hurt, pretty badly.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.360]   And this all of a sudden was when my family was moved out.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.880]   And again, out of the apartment, didn't really have a place to live.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.860]   So now I'm back to the drawing board.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.040]   And I really wrestled with what's the right thing to do.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.440]   I knew I could go ahead and buy a newer truck.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.560]   If I were willing to spend 25,000 bucks, you can buy diesel pickup trucks in good shape
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.000]   that'll do the job all day long.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.760]   But I didn't want to spend $25,000.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.080]   I feel like it's dumb to spend.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.700]   I'd rather, if I've got $25,000 to spend, I'd rather spend $10,000 or less on a truck
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:43.080]   and $15,000 on fuel and money for things while traveling, then put it into the truck.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.400]   I don't get the point of why people spend so much money on having the fanciest RV that
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   just sits in the driveway.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.520]   I'd rather have the cheapest RV that's out on the road.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.760]   And you go and you use the thing up because they all break, they all fall apart anyway.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.200]   So go and buy it, get something that does the job, but then go and use it, drive the
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.000]   wheels off of it, and then make sure that you actually have a bunch of experiences.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Same thing with trucks.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.040]   It doesn't make sense to me why I see $80,000 pickup trucks that basically sit at home all
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   the time.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.360]   And you go shop the market for RVs and trucks.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.920]   And it's very sad.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.360]   You talk to all kinds of owners who've bought these beautiful vehicles new, and they used
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.320]   them a dozen times, and now they're selling them.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.640]   That doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   Why not buy something that just barely does the job with sufficient comfort?
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.320]   For example, you do need sufficient comfort, you need to meet your minimums, but then save
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.040]   all that other money for fuel and for going to things that you want to see.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.520]   So that's been my operating mindset.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.480]   My goal originally was to get the whole rig put together for under $10,000.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.720]   That proved not to be possible, although I thought it was going to be.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.960]   If I had bought a slightly smaller RV, if I had a slightly smaller family, I could have
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   done it for $10,000.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.560]   At the end of the day, then I put it for $15,000.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.200]   And so total, I've got about $15,000 into the whole thing.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.760]   And that leaves plenty of money for diesel fuel.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.480]   That leaves plenty of money to go to attractions and things like that.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.420]   And to me, that just makes more sense than having the fanciest stuff that sits around
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.840]   and drains your bank account.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.360]   So truck was stolen and then thinking, "Okay, what do I do?
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   How do I replace it?"
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:25.320]   Now, having shopped the marketplace, I will tell you this, buying a specific used car
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.680]   fast and at a good deal is not easy.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.360]   Because of my requirements and because of the fact that I was shopping anywhere from
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:43.220]   16 to 19-year-old vehicles, the market is out there, but the market for good vehicles
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.160]   is a lot smaller.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.880]   You can go and you can buy a truck with 300,000 miles on it all day long.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   And there's some power to the argument to say that that 300,000-mile truck has a lot
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.360]   of life left in it.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.460]   But it's tough to buy a really good one fast.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.100]   So I started shopping hard and I shopped hard and I shopped hard.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:10.600]   Now, here are a few of the tactics that I've used to good success when trying to do this.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.240]   If you're trying to buy something that's good, something that's cheap, and that's fast, I
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.140]   already talked about the first tactic, which is be as flexible as you can on what you're
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.240]   actually trying to get.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.140]   So my only two things were crew cab and a 7.3-liter Ford diesel engine that was post-99.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.540]   The reason was that in '99, they made some changes to the mechanics of the engine.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.680]   You can buy the older trucks, but they're problematic now with being able to get parts
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   for them.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.540]   They didn't have as much power, so a newer truck.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:48.060]   But before '03, when they changed to the 6-liter engine, which can be a great engine, but has
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.740]   its own set of problems and is a little bit harder to predict.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.220]   So beyond that, I didn't care.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.140]   Two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, whatever.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.300]   Long bed, short bed, don't care.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.260]   Color, I don't care.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.500]   But I needed to be in good condition.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.100]   I needed to basically be ready to hook up and go.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.100]   Now in the used car marketplace, you can often get a deal on something that needs a little
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.460]   bit of work, and that's what I did the first time around.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.460]   I had time.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.580]   And so you get something, any time you get a used car, there's always going to be stuff
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.580]   that needs to be done.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.900]   That's why it's being sold in the first place generally.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.780]   So I bought it early, had time for it to sit at the mechanic.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.540]   But now, I got no place for my family to live.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.900]   We're basically living out of a backpack while we were traveling and doing some other
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.900]   things.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.900]   Now what do I do?
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.220]   So I shopped hard.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.780]   So the first strategy was be open to different options.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.720]   Second strategy is know your market.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.020]   One of the things that I think makes a big difference is being able for you as a buyer
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.540]   to move fast.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.260]   In any negotiation, when you're buying something, there are a few different things that you
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.260]   can negotiate.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.060]   They basically fall into the points of price and terms.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.180]   So price is what most people only negotiate on.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.780]   What's the actual price?
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.300]   And price matters.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.160]   But you can also negotiate based upon terms.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.060]   So the simple reality is sometimes if you're willing to buy fast, if you're willing to
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:16.580]   sign now, you may be able to get a better price or better terms because of your willingness
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.580]   to move fast.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.780]   Well, my theory is this.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.300]   If I know what I want and I have money, I can move fast.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.460]   Other things involve things like having cash.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.860]   Literal cash.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.620]   When you get to vehicles of a certain market, there's a weird wrinkle in the used car market
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.100]   that relates to financing.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.700]   Most people that buy vehicles don't just pay for them.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.640]   They buy them on payments.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.200]   But financing companies will only insure newer vehicles with lower miles.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:51.180]   So because those vehicles are open to financing, you find that there is a strong market for
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.660]   them, and the prices are relatively high.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.140]   People generally don't mind paying more when they can make monthly payments.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.660]   And so newer vehicles have higher prices because financing is available.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.380]   On the flip side, if you go down to the bottom end of the market, cars that are a few thousand
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.840]   bucks, those cars are affordable for many people, and so they generally move quickly.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.900]   If they're good cars and they're a few thousand bucks, lots of people can put together a few
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.180]   thousand bucks for basic transportation.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:21.460]   So it's hard in those markets to differentiate yourself.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.900]   Those markets are often very strong.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.260]   There are lots of people buying.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.980]   But there's a wrinkle in the middle where you're buying a vehicle that's beyond the
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.700]   financial capacity of the average person.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:38.020]   The average person doesn't have $15,000, $20,000 that they can just write a check for.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:43.220]   So you have a smaller pool of competitive buyers that you're competing against.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:49.580]   And also, those vehicles are not available for financing.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.180]   So you have a smaller pool of people who can't get the financing.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:58.420]   And so there are good deals to be had in that marketplace where you get a great car that
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.220]   has a lot of life left in it, but it's cheaper than other options because you're moving with
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:07.300]   cash and you can compete in that marketplace.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.940]   So follow that way in the back of your mind for the next time you need a car.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.020]   I don't think everybody should drive $2,000 cars, but there is a time at which vehicles
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.480]   are no longer financeable and you can get a good price discount there.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.700]   So if you're shopping, in addition to being flexible on what you're actually willing to
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.900]   buy, if you can be knowledgeable enough to be able to move quickly, that can help you
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.660]   to get better deals.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:39.800]   So this last week, literally Monday morning, I finally decided I couldn't find anything
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:49.740]   that was reasonably priced, that was low priced, and that had good enough prices.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.780]   It's hard sometimes to broadcast outside because then you see more distractions than inside.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.980]   I couldn't find anything that was reasonably enough priced, that had low enough miles that
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.100]   I thought it would be good to hook up and go.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.580]   And because I didn't have time to have a vehicle sit in the shop for a long time to get ready
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.100]   to go across the country, I was feeling pretty constricted.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.700]   So I decided on Monday morning, "Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and fix the truck I've
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.700]   got."
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.700]   The damage was significant.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.380]   The insurance company totaled the vehicle.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.460]   But it was also, I felt like it was largely cosmetic.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.300]   And I figured, "Well, if I'm willing to drive an ugly vehicle, this could work out.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.820]   I'll take a check from the insurance company, I'll drive the vehicle with a salvaged title,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.860]   and we'll just head out across the country."
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.980]   Well, on Monday morning, I came across a vehicle on OfferUp.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.460]   I was shopping hard in the private market, OfferUp, LinkedIn.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.860]   Facebook is also good for this.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.100]   Sorry, not LinkedIn, Craigslist.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.700]   I have found over the years, after being a long-time Craigslist shopper, I feel like
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.060]   Craigslist is losing its luster a little bit.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:55.620]   I've often found a bigger selection on OfferUp and on Facebook Marketplace than on Craigslist.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.880]   So keep those in mind when you're shopping.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.740]   But I found a vehicle that had just come online.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.980]   I went immediately to look at it.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.500]   Literally, my wife and I drove our children just across the state.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.700]   We hadn't planned to leave in the morning, but I went to look at it and was able to work
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.700]   the deal.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:16.780]   I laid a stack of $100 bills on the hood and walked away with a truck that is an older
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.260]   truck but has very low miles.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.920]   And it was just in great shape.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.060]   But I only would have had the confidence to do it if I had been hardcore shopping.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.960]   I'd looked at a lot of trucks.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.180]   And that would be one of the things that I would recommend to you.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.100]   If you're in the market, you need to be able to know what is available for you when you
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.160]   actually...
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.560]   You need to know your market.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.020]   And you can't know your market just from pictures.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.540]   So what I've often found with used vehicles, you need to go and look at them.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.760]   You need to drive them at least a little bit.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.800]   And you can start to develop an understanding of the marketplace.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.860]   When you look at one that's $15,000, you look at another that's $7,500, and you look at
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.780]   one with 300,000 miles, and you look at one with 150,000 miles, you can start to understand
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.180]   the demand for these vehicles.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.560]   You can talk with the sellers and you can see them.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:10.900]   So that when it comes to the point at which you are ready to buy one, you can be confident
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.500]   in saying, "Yes, I'll buy."
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.580]   So shop hard.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.140]   And that's one way that you can be able to move fast when the market is there.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.500]   So thankfully we got a truck.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.140]   And that morning I thought I had decided I was going to fix the other one.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.260]   Then finally something came on the market.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.220]   It had just been listed, went to see it immediately, bought it immediately, and that evening was
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.220]   working on...
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.780]   I drove the new truck home.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.020]   Spend the next few days cleaning it up.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.260]   That's what occupied all of last week.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.060]   But cleaned the truck up, did a bunch of mechanical stuff, changed the fluids, changed the bearings,
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.100]   and had my fingers deep in grease just getting everything ready to go on the road.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.940]   But thankfully it didn't need much, and hooked it up and went.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.340]   Now here would be the flip side.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.780]   Let me give you one more example where I haven't been able to find something yet.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.540]   That's related to a topper.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.580]   Now for our purposes, one of the most important things about a pickup truck is being able
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.420]   to put a big topper on the back so that we can have essentially a garage and keep the
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.140]   stuff that we have out of the elements.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:16.860]   And I have shopped and shopped and shopped the market for toppers, and I have not been
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.860]   able to find anything that was cheap and good.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.460]   Cheap and appropriate for my particular needs and the specific things that I want.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.460]   Not buying a new one.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.260]   And I haven't been willing to buy a new one.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.340]   So I said, well, we'll just hit the road without it and try to find one on the road.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.620]   So I continue to shop.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.140]   I continue to look for that.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.900]   I haven't found one yet.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.780]   But time will tell, and I think I'll find one in time.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.420]   But it just goes to show that I'm not saying this formula, you can't always beat it, but
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.060]   it is pretty neat when you can.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.140]   So that's the trip report so far.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.700]   We are on the road.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.700]   We're currently in Georgia.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.340]   We're heading quickly across the country because our traveling season has gotten constricted.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.460]   And once we get across the country, we'll probably slow down a little bit.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.780]   But our traveling season and the time of year has gotten constrained because of our late
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.780]   start.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.140]   And I'll tell you what, last week was tough.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.260]   I was tired.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.860]   I've done the best I could, but a lot of things have suffered.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.340]   My business has suffered.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.620]   I've had some unhappy clients.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.780]   Unhappy emails, and I haven't released a show in a little while.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.780]   And that's life.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.100]   You just do the best you can.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.660]   At the end of the day, we just got caught in a tough spot.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.860]   And it was really very challenging.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.000]   And so I just want to encourage you, not everything is all fun and roses.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.460]   Even now, I won't talk about even switching into a, transferring into an RV.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.400]   I won't talk about it for at least a month or a couple months.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.940]   Because one thing that my wife and I have learned is stuff takes time to adjust to.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.760]   Anytime you adjust to a new situation, it takes time.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.260]   And I think one of the biggest things that we've learned that I'd encourage you to consider
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:10.140]   adopting is don't make judgments on things until you've developed time.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.660]   Don't make snap decisions.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.740]   Moving into the RV has been uncomfortable.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.980]   It's still uncomfortable.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.220]   But I know that in time, it will be less uncomfortable.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.580]   It's uncomfortable because it's been crazy.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.380]   Just the logistics of it.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.300]   It takes time to figure out where to put things, how to make things work.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.540]   But it won't always be uncomfortable.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.100]   It's just uncomfortable now.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.580]   So I won't make any decisions about is this working, is this not working for at least
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.500]   a month, couple months.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:47.300]   I vividly remember when my wife and I married, she had been living in a very small studio
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.180]   apartment that was very inexpensive.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.300]   It was 234 square feet.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:57.140]   And after we married, we decided I moved into the apartment there with her.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.140]   And I remember just standing in that little kitchen of that tiny little studio apartment
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.980]   and just thinking how unbelievably small it was and how this is never going to work.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.980]   What were we thinking?
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.580]   You know, trying to fit two people into this tiny little apartment.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.580]   What's wrong with us?
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.580]   Well, we wanted to save the money.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.580]   It was a cheap deal, etc.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.240]   But I just thought this is never going to work.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.300]   But I put off judgment for a while.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.100]   And after a few weeks, it was just normal, totally comfortable.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.620]   Now after we moved out of that apartment, we moved into a big old three bedroom house.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.340]   And I remember we looked at each other and this house was huge.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.220]   And we just felt like we were rattling around in this house.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.860]   And after a few weeks, it felt totally normal.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.300]   And that's been my experience in almost any life transition, any life change.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.620]   It takes time to get used to it.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.860]   So I'll share more about the trip in the future.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.980]   I'm not going to turn Radical Personal Finance into just a travel log.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.140]   I want to provide things that are more useful to you rather than just sharing with my goals.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.500]   But I also know that it is interesting to you.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.500]   So that's the travel log.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   That's the story.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.620]   So we're again, very happy to say we're on the road.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.820]   And that's the saga.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.420]   Thank you for your patience with the intermittent, the non-existent shows the last week and a
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.420]   half.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.740]   I've missed you all.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.500]   I've had my fingers deep in Greece.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.580]   I've been running all over the state.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.300]   I've been wheeling and dealing, trying desperately to put this thing together and not lose any
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.900]   more of the travel season.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.660]   And finally, we made it clear.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.820]   So in summary, just think of the good, cheap, and fast when you are making your next buying
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.820]   decision.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.820]   And again, I encourage you.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   It's good to get good.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.060]   And again, when buying things, selection, exactly what you want.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.620]   Get something good.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.660]   Get something cheap.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.660]   That usually means you will have to go ahead.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:44.460]   You'll have to be a little bit ahead and move slower to be able to find what you need when
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.460]   you want it.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:50.740]   Now, if your back's up against the wall, well, be willing to adjust a little bit in what
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.200]   you're willing to accept.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.240]   The more flexible you are on what you want, the bigger the marketplace is.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.060]   The more selection will be available to you.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.000]   Be knowledgeable enough.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Study your market.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.220]   Understand what you're doing.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.780]   Know the values of things.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.980]   Be knowledgeable enough to go in.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.580]   And when you see the deal, then you move fast.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.580]   And always think about the terms in addition to the price.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.060]   And figure out how can you make the terms work for you.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.060]   Last point is this.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:21.360]   When I bought the truck, I would have paid more money.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.180]   Because money is worth different amounts at different points of time.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.900]   When you have six months, and you're six months before you plan to leave, well, in that case,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.820]   I would quibble over a couple thousand dollars.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.460]   I would fight with somebody, and I would negotiate, and I would quibble, and I would just take
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.460]   my time because it's a couple thousand dollars.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.780]   But when I was in the situation that I was in, I would have paid more.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.660]   Thankfully, I'm so thankful I found a great deal, great truck.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.740]   It's a hundred thousand fewer miles than my other truck, and it's going to work out really
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.740]   well.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.740]   I'm really, really happy with it.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.220]   But I would have been willing to pay more.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.980]   And the point is, money doesn't always have the same value.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.580]   So assess its value to you at a certain time.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.740]   And hopefully you'll be able to work through the challenges.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.780]   Fighting is easy.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.700]   No big task, no big goal is easy.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.580]   They don't come without challenges.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.700]   And so I hope you can be encouraged by my story that just know that just because you
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:18.340]   face challenges doesn't mean you have to give up.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.220]   Just keep fighting, keep working through.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.560]   Be back with you soon.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.560]   Thank you for listening.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.780]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.580]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.300]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.660]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:45.420]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.460]   action on it.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.880]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.220]   to a life change.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.200]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.900]   So take action.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:06.520]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.080]   that you care about.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:15.280]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.740]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:23.580]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:30.440]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.720]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.420]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.080]   this work voluntarily.
