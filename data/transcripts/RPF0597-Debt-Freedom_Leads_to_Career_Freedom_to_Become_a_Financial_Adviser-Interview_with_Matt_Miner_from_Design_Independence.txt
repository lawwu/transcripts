[00:04:47.980 --> 00:05:17.200]   pacific and I had as many as 100 incoming phone calls from my staff. Fast forward to April of this year and the transition that we made was to join a fee-only independent financial planning firm here in Raleigh which I guess was just a chance to kind of continue to riff on my personal finance interests. What's kind of been terrific about this opportunity is just how much I enjoy the folks that I work with
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.920]   and how
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.700]   I want to talk with you a good bit about the move into financial planning because a lot of the things that we've been doing in the last couple of years are kind of front and center in my life and made this fit with TLC Wealth super enjoyable for me.

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   I'm going to talk a little bit about the move into financial planning because a very significant percentage of my listeners are interested in the world of finance.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   That was my own journey.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   I was interested in personal finance when I became a professional financial advisor and I know a lot of people have that interest but I'm more interested to begin with in your thoughts on financial independence so here's what I understand and you correct me on this you began your focus on personal finance about six years ago and some of the initial
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:47.140]   input into your life that opened your eyes was Dave Ramsey's program.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   is that accurate?
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   So prior to that time were you did you just not pay attention to money what was your relationship with the finances of your life yeah so prior to that time and I guess you know if you wanted to kind of break it into so I'm 39 years old my adult life you know if you want to figure that sort of starts sometime around 2000 I was still an undergrad at that time but I was earning a decent amount of money you know prior to kind of about
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   a decent amount of money you know prior to kind of about
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   about

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:09:13.840]   Most of us feel that way. If we just make enough money, well, everything will work out. And so you're sitting down and doing an analysis on what degree to get, and you say, well, I'll get a business degree, because at least then I can make a lot of money. And if you're thinking about borrowing money, taking money out on student loans, you think, well, that's no big deal, because I'll be able to repay it, repay it. And what's fairly normal is you start to accumulate the normal amount of debt. Whether or not you've been frivolous, whether or not you've wasted money is relatively immaterial.

[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Is that accurate with your experience?
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Yeah, no, that resonates completely.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Yeah, and then in my experience,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   I think that Dave Ramsey and his message of being debt-free is so powerful for two reasons. For me, it was recognizing if I don't have any payments, then I have this whole income that I can't pay for.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   And then I have this whole income that I can't pay for.

High savings rates gives you options. Low expenses give you options. They allow you to adjust your career at a phase of life at which many people could not adjust their careers. You have children. I won't say it's been easy. Yeah. Oh, of course it's not.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:32.520]   You have children. I mean, it's not easy. It's not easy, but it's more doable. But many people, if they are not in control of their expense on the expense side of their of their income and expenses. If they're not in control of that, then they feel trapped. They can't pivot. They can't adjust their life. So by control of the expenses, which came from getting out of debt and it instilled that discipline in you. Getting out of debt led to control of expenses. Control of expenses leads to savings. Savings leads to options. Options to start new businesses, change careers, etc.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:32.660]   Yeah.

And you know obviously seeking to do both those things.

[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   I think as a former consumer of financial services or still as a consumer of financial services, I have always done what I would encourage any client to do which is to you know, that the person thoroughly understand if there's a legitimate fit between you and you know, between the client and the advisor whether you guys kind of even on the same page.

I do think that on the on the
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:34:01.960]   the one hand I do think that how the advisor gets paid matters. I also think that ultimately the advisor has to be a person of integrity and the client has to have the ability to understand that the advisor is a person of integrity in order for the relationship to be successful because there there are potential conflicts in in every relationship even as I think about someone who I really admire Dr. Jeffery,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.100]   I think that on the one hand I do think that how the advisor gets paid matters I also think that ultimately the advisor has to be a person of integrity and the client has to have the ability to understand that the advisor is a person of integrity in order for the relationship to be successful because there there are potential conflicts in in every relationship even as I think about someone who I really admire Dr. Jeffery,

[00:34:41.320 --> 00:35:00.460]   Yeah. Some of the ethical issues in the financial advice space are really, really tough. And I agree with your analysis in the sense of, in general, it's been my observation that a person of integrity,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:29.640]  , 00:37:04.257 -- 00:37:09.575 will usually behave in an upright and appropriate way no matter where they are, no matter the model that they're in, no matter the compensation model, no matter the practice structure, etc. And a person without integrity will find ways to abuse almost any system that they're in. The problem is I don't know what percentage of people are people of integrity and I don't know how to prove that in advance.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   The problem is I don't know what percentage of people are people of integrity and I don't know how to prove that in advance.
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.680]   It's kind of a mystery.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   And so I think the incentives do matter. Practice structure matters. There are some things that are better. And I think we would all be well served to acknowledge that we're weak and fallible people.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:58.820]   00:37:19.575 -- 00:37:33.575 And that's why putting in place structures that hold us accountable is important. And then how to do that in the financial advice space is tough. So it sounds like your primary focus is to be able to do that in the financial advice space.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:58.820]   It's not just a matter of how you're doing it.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:58.820]   It's not just a matter of how you're doing it.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:28.100]  , 00:37:33.575 -- 00:37:44.575 Yeah.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.160]   00:37:44.575 -- 00:37:47.575 Yeah.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:28.220]   00:37:47.575 -- 00:37:49.575 Yeah.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:28.260]   00:37:49.575 -- 00:37:50.575 Yeah.

And then Josh Sell, who's our managing partner, is also a CFP and has been doing this for his entire career. And then Mike Perkins is a CPA and is the other advisor here. So we have, I think we would say, we feel like between an MBA, a CFP, and a CPA, we have some really highly qualified and educated folks working at PLC Wealth.

[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   When you chose the fee-only route, so fee-only is a big, is a big, it's an increasingly big deal in terms of the amount of money that you're saving.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:38:22.480]  , is, is a big, is an increasingly big deal in terms of the amount of money that you're saving. The idea, of course, of fee-only is because you don't take commissions from companies that are paying you to place their products. The idea is you will be less biased, you'll be more focused exclusively on the client's interests. And in fact, as a fee-only fiduciary, that is also your legal obligation.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:22.980]   That's correct.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.480]   That's correct.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:33.520]   Did you believe that you had to be a fee-only financial advisor in order to be ethical and, and live in integrity? Or did you believe that it was optional?
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   Hmm.

So we're a, I mean, I know you have some industry followers out there. We're a DFA shop. I do believe in what DFA is doing, although value investing has struggled for the last 10 years as a company.

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:39.120]   And in essence, my summary of what they do is they're a mutual fund company, but they exclusively sell their mutual funds through advisors.

[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.140]   We're managing the market, we're getting the market returns, but we're also getting some additional benefits such as stability of funds because all of our funds come through the DFA.

[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.880]   For example, people think well, you know, this is just another tax deferred bucket and I know I'm saving for retirement but I don't really know that I'm saving for medical expenses because I'm healthy. Well, for example, as has been, you know, you can find plenty of articles about this but health savings account is actually other than any employer match you might be getting a lot of money out of it.

[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.460]   We have singular consulting engagements.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.620]   We have comprehensive planning without investment management.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:33.960]   And then, like most firms in our RIA channel,
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:39.920]   asset management and traditional planning for clients who already have significant assets
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.000]   is clearly the bread and butter.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.500]   And I'm certainly trying to ask you a provocative question
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.580]   because one of my goals, personally,
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.240]   is to have a good financial experience.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:50.300]   And I want to affect the financial advantage of the financial advantage of the financial advantage.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:53:19.000]  , and I want us to help us do a better job of speaking honestly to people.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.060]   And one of those things is simply,
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:19.080]   you need to have put together enough money to afford good advice.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:19.400]   If you're going to pay a couple thousand bucks for a financial planning engagement,
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:49.420]   and you're going to have to pay a professional for their perspective,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   and I think that if we focused on helping people to do that and helping people to see the value of that,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   then we could help more people to cross over.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   So I want to close with two questions here.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   Question number one, if you were giving advice to somebody who's currently broke, whether that's through whatever variety. Now, having gone through your career as a professional,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good financial experience,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   and you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good financial experience, you're going to have a good investment.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   Question number two, if you were giving advice to somebody who's currently broke, whether that's through this pathway of seeing the personal finance side,
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   I think, you know, if you want a vast array of content, the internet is full of it.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   You know, there's some places that are probably better to look than others.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   Radical personal finance, especially in your early episodes, is very focused on the financial side.

[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.040]   to talk about the importance
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:48.080]   of having some insurance
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   coverage.

[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   then you can move on to the additional steps.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   So I agree with you.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   I think you have to, in some ways, I try to speak a little harshly sometimes to try to be grating a little bit to some listeners to say, like, get it together. But you got to get it together before you can go on to advanced concepts. And it's just down to simple behavior. So here's my last question, Matt, and I'll let you give after you get your answer.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   Matt, and I'll let you give after you get your answer.

[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:18.100]   The general financial planning community largely doesn't understand the fire mindset. What's your perspective as a new financial advisor? What's your perspective on fire and the financial planning community?

One of the things obviously that has come out in your show over time, I think it's come through both call-in questions as well as emails, are folks from the fire community who want to work with an advisor, but have difficulty finding one that even understands what this is. I would say that I'm a huge fan of the fire community, and I think it's a great thing to be able to work with an advisor who has a great deal of experience and a great deal of experience in the fire community.
