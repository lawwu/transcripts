[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   All right, Chris, moving on, Chris asks, Do you think there's a place for inbox zero in your
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.840]   productivity system? If yes, how do you manage to keep up with your inbox without spending hours on
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.280]   reading, classifying, answering mails, even if you only spend that time in specific time blocks?
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.520]   So I think Chris, yes. Inbox zero, by which I mean an inbox that on a regular basis goes down
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.240]   to having no messages in it, yes, is a good goal. And two, this should not require hours of reading,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.960]   classifying and answering emails. Now, I don't mean to say it doesn't require that right now,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.040]   I think for most people, the way they use their email, the way they use their inboxes,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.680]   to get it down to zero would require hours of them going through this, it would be a Herculean task.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.840]   But if you update and improve your relationship with this tool, getting down to inbox zero becomes
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.240]   much more tractable. And it's what you want to do. Because getting down to inbox zero means
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.800]   you have a pipeline of incoming and outcoming information that you're keeping up with.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.560]   I mean, the only thing it means if your inbox is getting bigger and bigger, is that the pipeline
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.680]   of stuff coming in, you can't keep up with it, you don't have other systems for it.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   And you have this default spillover, let's just keep stuff in our inbox.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.560]   So let me give you four things you can do, Chris. Four things you can do to improve your
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.840]   relationship with your inbox that will make inbox zero much more tractable.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.560]   All right, number one, don't use email for back and forth conversation.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.080]   Don't, I got to figure something out, we got to go back and forth about it. Don't do that with email
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.800]   that generates a huge amount of email, it's a huge pain. Back and forth conversation should
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.360]   be synchronous. There's a lot of ways to do this. There's office hours, there's calls,
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.560]   they're tacking on conversations to the end of pre existing meetings, however you want to do it.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.120]   If it requires back and forth, you should be talking to a person, two minutes can accomplish
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.880]   what 20 back and forth emails would otherwise be required to do. Number two, don't store
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.240]   information in your inbox. This is a child's way of doing knowledge work information management,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.480]   you're a grown up, you need something more sophisticated. You have to have places where
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.400]   you store relevant information, you have to have places where you keep track of what you're working
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.880]   on, what you're waiting for, and what you know about it. I personally recommend something like
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.160]   a Trello board, one for each of your different professional roles, where you can keep track of
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.640]   what's in progress, what you know about it, what you're waiting to hear back on.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.360]   So if in one of your roles as a professor, you are the head of the faculty advisory committee,
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.800]   I say this from experience, I'm about to take on that role as the head of the faculty advisory
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.360]   committee in September, have a board for that. If there's things you're waiting to hear back from,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.280]   you're trying to talk to your committee members about when to meet, or you're waiting to hear
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.360]   someone is taking a stab at writing up the report that you're going to bring to the faculty meeting,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   you should have a column in your Trello board for that role that says waiting to hear back from,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.520]   and that's where those are, not an email in your inbox that you hope you just see and say,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.680]   oh yeah, that's right, I'm waiting for someone to respond to that email. Let's say you're working
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.400]   on something in one of your roles, have a projects column and there's a card for it on your Trello
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.560]   board, and you're attaching the relevant files to it, and right at the top of the card, you say
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.760]   capital letters, status, colon, quick update on that status. You look at the board for that role,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.600]   you get the whole just stalled to what's going on in five minutes. None of this needs to be in your
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.240]   inbox. So again, keeping track of what's going on in your inbox is a child's way of managing
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.360]   information. Be an adult, be more sophisticated. Three, use process-centric emails.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   Now I talked about this in a habit tune-up, I think Jesse would have to go back to the
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.600]   archives, but I think in the last couple of months, I did a habit tune-up on process-centric
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.040]   emails. There's probably a YouTube video on that at youtube.com/calendarformedia. But here's the
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   brief summary. When you send an email to someone to initiate something that needs to get done,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.520]   this meeting has to get set up, this client visit needs to be arranged.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.880]   First, figure out the entire process for how you're going to get to completion. I will put up
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.720]   some ideas by this date, you will look at those ideas and mark the ones that work best. I'll then
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.120]   send a complete list once you've marked that on Wednesday morning to the client, and then I'll
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.520]   update you on our staff meeting on Friday, what we're going to do. Come up with the process for
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.400]   how you're going to get from here to completion and explain that process in the very first email
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.360]   you send about that obligation. Significantly reduces the number of back and forth messages
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.160]   that follow because you have a clear process about what you guys are going to do. Number four,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.160]   things that are informational, newsletters, like my newsletter, calnewport.com,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.240]   broadcast of deals, whatever it is that you get just informationally through your inbox where
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.800]   you never know which ones are going to be interesting, what won't, you might want to
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.400]   save things for a while to see if you want to read it, have a separate account for that.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.640]   And if it's too late to have a separate account, then set up a filter
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.600]   to a separate label or folder, and you can update what gets filtered and treat that differently.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.400]   Oh, here's my informational account. Here's my informational label or folder. And that's
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.160]   different. That's outside of your inbox, your worldview, because there's no stress
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.640]   captured by those messages. None of them make any demands of you or your time.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.480]   It's a digital library for you to browse at your leisure. So separate that from the rest of your
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.960]   inbox. Then you can inbox zero what remains. All right, Chris, so there you go. The backstory
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.000]   on inbox zero. I wrote about this, that term in a piece I wrote a few years ago for the New Yorker
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.960]   called the rise and fall of getting things done. Merlin Mann, the productivity guru, Merlin Mann,
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   it was his book contract to write a book titled Inbox Zero that essentially broke him and his
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.840]   interest in productivity. He struggled so philosophically about what's the point of
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.000]   getting super fiddly about processing emails in your inbox. It's actually what broke him.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.440]   And he just couldn't write the book. He was on the contract, couldn't do it. And so it was like
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:24.400]   the Inbox Zero book was what broke. Inbox Zero broke Merlin Mann's productivity standing or
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:33.040]   interest. It was an interesting little tidbit from the history of productivity.
