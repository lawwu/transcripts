[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Okay in the last video we put together the default Streamlit component or
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:17.680]   custom component and Setup our environment for actually building our own. So what we
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.960]   have at the moment is pretty simple we haven't really done anything we just
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   have this custom component Streamlit and we can see the code for this
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.960]   component as well if we have a look over over here so this is just a default
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.640]   component we're not actually doing anything here. We're just actually not in
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.720]   that file it's in the init.py here. We're just running this using nothing more
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:57.280]   than this code here. Okay so we have this my component object but that's all that
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.480]   you can see where we're like clicking and everything else so this here it's
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.120]   hello James click me that's hello world click me that's all it is it's just a
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.840]   little object. So what we want to do is actually create a card component based
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.680]   on material UI which is what you see here like this sort of card we're not
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.320]   going to make it that fancy although it's really not difficult if you want to
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.200]   take it up further you definitely can. What we're going to do is you're going to take like a
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.680]   title a subtitle we're going to include body of text like this and we also want
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.840]   to include like a button not like well kind of similar to this way we have like
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   a circle and we hover over it and if we click it there's this nice little ripple
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:05.400]   effect. Okay so let's start putting that part of our component together the
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.360]   actual code that creates this card. So most of this is going to come
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.600]   from this card component of TSX file and now in here at the moment is there's a
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.440]   lot of code like far too much we don't need all of this we can delete a lot of
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   it so let's let's do that first before we do anything else. First I'm going to
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:43.960]   change this to any, I'm going to remove all of this. We don't need the state variable we also
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.320]   don't need this name variable as well but I'm going to keep it in here for now
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.560]   because this is how we pass arguments to our card so we're gonna title,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:08.440]   subtitle, body and link. We're going to remove the theme, we don't need this. We
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.400]   do want to include something here so this is where we return the actual HTML
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:28.760]   that controls our look and actual structure of our code. Okay so I'm going
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.920]   to remove these functions that we have here as well don't need any of these
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.240]   these are all very specific to that default component that we saw and then
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   the rest so the rest of this are actually we do need. I'm just going to
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.200]   remove, we don't need so many comments for sure. So yeah that that's basically
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.920]   everything we can remove and I'm also going to just clean this up or just
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.640]   remove everything actually for now so we'll leave it like this. Okay so this
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:18.560]   here is it's very core what we need in our component in our React component so
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:28.800]   if we switch over to our hosted version of our component now we should see
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:37.560]   that's pretty much well it should pretty much be empty so yeah okay so now we
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.440]   just have this you click zero times but that that like click me part of the
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.640]   component that's not there anymore it doesn't exist okay I mean it is
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.880]   actually still there but it's just a it's just some empty span tags there's
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.040]   nothing nothing we can actually see. So now what I want to do let's modify this
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.400]   so that we can have a different app or a different way of viewing our components
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:23.520]   so come over to init.py okay I'm just gonna put this is like test one we have
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.200]   our components and I'm gonna have I'm going to include this divider test two
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:52.880]   this okay and then here I'm just going to put anything really oh and also remove this okay
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:01.840]   rerun okay now we just get this now let's add some something to our
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.440]   component so so if I go to here let's go to the card component txt what I'm
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.120]   going to do is I'm going to copy this paste it a few times and I'm going to
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.680]   include the components or the parts of our card so I want to have a title
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:40.000]   subtitle a body and a link okay and we'll just rename these as well
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:54.880]   title okay move that as well now so now if I switch back over to the local host
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:03.680]   rerun we're probably going to get an error I would expect to see some sort of
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:11.880]   error okay so actually okay that's fine so at the moment we have that name and
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.360]   everything in there but they're not being used and they're also not being
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.760]   passed to our component if we look at our code in init.py we're just passing
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   this one parameter and also passing key now our component doesn't include any of
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:35.120]   those it actually includes these like title, subtitle, body and link so how do
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.400]   we how do we add those in we head over to init.py and scroll up a little bit
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.760]   and we see the definition of our component this acts as like the middleman
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.600]   between our components actually should be called a component and later on we
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   should be calling this card component as well
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:13.480]   do you have any of my buttons okay seems fine so in here we are accepting just
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:20.280]   name we don't want to accept just name we want to accept all names as well so
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.240]   I'm going to remove most of this
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:48.440]   and I'm going to swap this out for title, subtitle, body and also link okay so we
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.080]   passed those in and then in our component function we also need to pass
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:09:13.320]   those so let's go title, subtitle, body, link
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:23.800]   now we can remove these other parts for now so we don't need this key. Key is useful
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.960]   if you have multiple components and they have certain action on them so you for
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.680]   example press to expand them you want to include key as you would pass just like
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.840]   a random number to each version of that component and that allows Streamlit to
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.000]   identify those each of those individual versions of your component as actual
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.120]   independent components so when you press the action expand one it doesn't expand
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.240]   all of them but we're not we don't have any actions I don't think so we don't
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.520]   need to worry about that
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:08.400]   okay we also don't need to return any component value so before where we saw
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.320]   it was saying like you would click and it was increasing that number that's
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.160]   what was going on there but we we're not doing that for our component we're just
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:25.960]   displaying some information or modifying anything okay now if we switch back to
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:35.600]   our local host we probably see an error so we rerun and we get this type error
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.080]   card component missing three required position arguments now the reason for
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.360]   that is because when we're actually calling our component in later on in
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   pi we're only passing a single parameter to it which is a big hello world so we
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.480]   need to pass at least four okay one for each of these arguments that we have so
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.800]   let's have a look at that in here okay so we have card component and we're
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.480]   passing at the moment this is just a title we want to pass okay let's say do
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.200]   title
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:26.440]   sub subtitle and have some some random text here for the for the body
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:44.840]   now we also want to have a link so I'm gonna go google.com okay and then let's
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.280]   just copy this component this isn't returning anything so let's remove this
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:12:00.660]   as well so let's copy that and this is going to be number two so the title to
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:11.640]   add some more text in here and yeah just leave it with Google it's fine I don't want to change too much
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:21.880]   now let's have a look at our logos rerun and now we have this so we don't still
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:29.320]   don't have anything in there let's have a look at why let's try to figure that
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:43.720]   out so we have our card component create this is how looking in here okay so at
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:51.200]   the moment we just have span okay we're not actually showing any of these any of
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.160]   these parameters that we've passed to our component so let's go ahead and do
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:04.920]   that we have let's wrap everything in it in a div and then I'm going to go just
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:13.240]   page good second heading for the title so to pass actual variables into here we
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:28.000]   just use each curly braces for subtitle and then we also want to include the
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:40.800]   body so body and also a link so for the that will just use a breath again using
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.120]   the curly braces in here as well as a link
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:53.040]   same for this link now let's have a look at what we what we get okay so we can
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.640]   see that we have our component now we have the title subtitles and text and
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:07.520]   body link like that and it will or it should take us to Google doesn't seem to
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:15.800]   work at the moment I'm not going to worry about that now but we'll make sure
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:25.240]   we get working for the actual card okay so that's we have the key components
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.320]   there but we need to actually format this into the material UI card so let's
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:37.840]   let's go and figure that out we'll come to here it will let's copy we'll copy
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.240]   this one
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:48.600]   maybe so an earlier one yeah let me I'll copy this one it's our line card here
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:55.800]   okay so there's a few things in here we need to need to make sure we include so
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.680]   we have these imports so we have a card card actions that's where we have like
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:09.560]   the button or where we will place a button so I'm going to import all those
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:23.320]   we do here save that and then we also want to include all of this stuff here
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:37.800]   so we have a card I'm going to down just copy all of that and let me paste after
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:53.840]   our link here so I can keep track of everything to the topography okay so we
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.520]   also need to add card around this I figure out in a minute
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:07.040]   that was so let's remove a few things so we have topography I want to so the body
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:18.640]   I'm going to include in here other topography to just remove I don't
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:26.760]   really want those button we're gonna modify all this so let's just leave it
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:35.520]   like that remove those and now we should see a card
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:44.480]   let's open this look okay so we kind of see we actually just have this the
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.040]   contents of the card I actually have the card that's because we also add the card
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   tag in there as well so if we just do card
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.200]   the variant is outlined
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:31.760]   so yeah so I mean so this bit here should be everything should outline have
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:38.240]   this on the on the outside so basically all of this in here all this constant
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:45.040]   card is actually being inserted and to this wrapped within card so that's why
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:53.560]   we can't actually see it at the moment so add this and we should it should work
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.920]   now we should be able to see something
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.000]   okay so now we have our card so we have the body of that but we need to include
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.640]   title subtitle and this learn more is it is a button at the moment I want to
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   make it like a like an icon button so we'll modify that as well so let's
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:25.440]   return to this I want to include the card header I go here card header and
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.160]   here we're going to have the title and also the subtitle so we have title and
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.000]   I think subheader
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:49.360]   subtitle and we just close that tag like that so look okay so cool we have
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:56.440]   our title with subtitle now it's looking better another thing that I'd like to
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:04.320]   include is a bit of padding here so I'm gonna write style and we have some
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:14.960]   padding going to be 0.5 rem okay so this just means if we have multiple cards and
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.400]   they choose each other they're not going to be touching there's gonna be a bit of
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:25.000]   space between them okay so it looks that's pretty good I think we just need
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.720]   to include the actual button okay so buttons are a little bit different
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.880]   I do have an example on a car okay here we have these buttons basically what we
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.560]   want so let's have a look at how how that is done so we see we have this icon
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.880]   button
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:58.920]   so we have card actions here and then we have icon button so I'm going to copy
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.080]   this
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:08.600]   place it in card actions and then replace this one here you don't want
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.720]   that okay icon button
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:26.160]   it's going to be like open URL and for share icon I'm not going to do that I'm
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:33.880]   going to I think it's expand icon is the one I want and change this to expand
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:42.280]   icon and we want to modify this so oh sorry we need to import everything so
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.080]   see at the moment says cannot find name icon buttons because we haven't imported
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:53.240]   it at the top so let's let's do that
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:21:03.640]   so let's have a look at our example again is it this one no this example we
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:15.280]   have icon button yeah okay so and we also have a share icon so let me copy
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.960]   that across
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:28.720]   okay and it's launch icon I think I think I wrote expand icon yep so launch
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:43.640]   icon instead and we import that so right import launch icon from and here we're
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.160]   going to use the icons material that we installed in the previous video so icons
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:22:04.920]   material and it's launch okay so let's have a look at what that looks like now
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.120]   okay so we have this launch icon doesn't do anything at the moment because we
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:16.200]   don't have any URL in there I'm connected about link yet so let's do
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:22.600]   that so you need to pass that into our the icon button part here so we have
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:30.440]   correct as we did before and we just passing our link and then another thing
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:43.800]   so okay let me save that so it should run it okay so now it's going blue that
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.160]   goes in that form because it's an actual link I was still not opening anything we
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:55.720]   need to the reason for that is because a streamer is displaying all this through
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:02.360]   a iframe which is like an embedded web page within the web page and so it's
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:10.520]   actually opening opening it within that iframe but at the moment it's just it's
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:16.200]   not working it's just not opening anything it's just because it's kind of
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.640]   being I think it's being blocked by or something on those lines I'm not sure so
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.120]   what we want to say is we want to open it in the parent browser of that iframe
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:39.200]   to target this actual window so to do that we need to add in here I need to
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:50.040]   modify the target so target is going to be equal to underscore parent now save
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:24:00.200]   that and try again okay now it's working again okay
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:13.600]   cool so and there there are cards one other thing we need to just see here is
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:21.480]   the actual font is different to the mui font yeah yeah this looks a lot nicer in
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:29.320]   here that's because they're using the Roboto font now to implement that we
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:40.640]   need to remember where is on here and maybe we can search at the top okay yeah
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.080]   so we can we can just copy this so we need to npm install in our front-end
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.200]   directory this so this is going to install the Roboto font for us I'm going
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.720]   to open another terminal window
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:04.400]   okay navigate to the front-end directory
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:31.440]   and we need npm install okay once that has installed so switch back to here we
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:41.880]   just need to import it into our card component.tsx so we'll go to the top and
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:53.040]   it's in the right comment so import font paste that and save and now this should
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.920]   look a lot nicer okay so now it's definitely using the
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   Roboto font, it looks cleaner so that's that's everything for the
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.960]   component I don't think there's anything else obviously in designing your own
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.520]   component you might want to make it more fancy and some other things in there but
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:25.200]   for this I think that's everything that I'd like to cover. In the next video
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.400]   what we're going to do is have a look at how to actually set this up for
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.920]   distribution so other people can pick and solve your component and actually
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.040]   use it in their own streamer apps so that's also pretty interesting and
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:47.880]   pretty straightforward, there's not too much to do there. The bulk of the work is what
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:55.080]   we've just done so thank you very much for watching I hope that is useful and
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.600]   I'll see you in the next video, bye!
