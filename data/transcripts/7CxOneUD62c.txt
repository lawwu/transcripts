[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   - All right, Jesse, well, I'm liking the live interaction
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.260]   we've put into the show.
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.300]   Last week, we had our friend David Sachs in the studio
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.720]   helping us answer some questions.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.520]   Today, let's take a live call from one of our listeners.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.300]   - Yep, we got Phillip here, so let's take a listen.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.700]   - All right, Phillip, thanks for calling into the podcast.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.180]   What is on your mind today?
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.940]   - Hey, Cal.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.220]   So I've been recently going through a bit of a life shift.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.860]   I spent a few years as an entrepreneur
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.520]   running two venture capital-backed startups.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.500]   Then after selling my last company,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.800]   I worked in product management roles
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.340]   at a couple of later stage technology startups
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.580]   for a few years.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.860]   And that was a lot of hyperactive hive mind,
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.080]   you know, over 100 Slack channels or 30 meetings per week.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.020]   A lot of structured what I was working on also, though.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.180]   And so now I've split out to start a new company.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.660]   And my goal is to build it solo without external funding,
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.480]   kind of Basecamp style.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.120]   And I'm spending about half of my time
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.660]   doing consulting work to cover costs.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.900]   And I'm spending the other half of my time
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.980]   developing my own in-house products.
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740]   The goal is to grow these in-house products and revenue
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.980]   so I can eventually focus on them more full-time.
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.220]   And I split out solo because I did some value-based,
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.940]   lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.640]   and decided that starting a solo product development studio
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.820]   aligns more with the values and lifestyle
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.540]   that I wanted to pursue.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.220]   So my high-level question is,
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.300]   how do I apply the principles of slow productivity
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.940]   and deep life to set myself up for success?
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.980]   I've gone from a lot of structure to no structure,
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.900]   and I could use some help
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.160]   making sure that my habits are sustainable.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.460]   - Well, I mean, first of all,
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.420]   I'm upset that you're not using our acronym for that.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.420]   - VBLCCP.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.780]   - VBLCCP, yeah.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.180]   I mean, this is, we gotta be pithy.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.480]   I think we all agree that that rolls off the tongue.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.640]   Okay, this is a great question.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.020]   Tell me a little bit more, though,
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.020]   about this studio situation you have set up.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.100]   What's that like?
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.340]   So what's the work gonna be like?
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.580]   - Yeah, so I'm doing some product development.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.340]   So I'm working with a client,
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.620]   kind of building an entire application,
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.660]   end to end, including definition and design
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.740]   and things like that.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.940]   And I'm working on a couple of personal projects,
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.300]   like one of which is the main focus,
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660]   already has revenue, already has some customers.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.940]   It's not quite revenue to live off of.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.700]   This is a path I used to start my previous company,
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.540]   Moonlight.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.740]   So we did some freelancing as we grew the company,
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.380]   and eventually it grew in size
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.060]   and raised venture capital
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.580]   and kind of took a traditional kind of path.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.660]   And I think a lot of what I'm trying to do
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.700]   with this product studio
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.740]   is also not necessarily trying to pursue
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.780]   that traditional path.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740]   There's a lot of kind of extrinsic markers of success.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.620]   Like you could go raise money and hire employees
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620]   and things like that.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.700]   I'm trying to be a little bit more controlled about that.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.820]   So my day-to-day is really unstructured.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.620]   I have full control of my time now.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.300]   I have one client meeting per week,
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.580]   which is a lot less than what I had
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.060]   at later stage startups.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.780]   So I'm tending to break my day
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.940]   into three, two-hour deep work blocks
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.900]   with kind of two hours in between each
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.260]   for a mix of admin work and breaks.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.940]   So I guess kind of like a general high-level question
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.380]   I have is, is this too much or too little deep work
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.660]   in a given day?
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.260]   And with more control of my time,
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.940]   is it better to break up my day more
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.620]   or to try to keep deep work
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.700]   and more work, admin work,
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.300]   focused on more of a traditional kind of nine-to-five slot?
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.140]   - Yep. All right.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.980]   That's a good question.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.380]   And we'll get in this nitty gritty.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.340]   I wanna underscore first,
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.100]   I like your decision you made of,
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.540]   well, let's keep this small.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.540]   Have you read Paul Jarvis, "The Company of One"?
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.500]   - Yeah, I've read part of it.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.300]   I don't think I finished it, but it's a good book.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.260]   - I mean, you're right in line, I think,
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.540]   with Paul's thinking here.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.820]   If people haven't read that, they should.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.540]   It has a blurb for me, so you know that it's quality.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.420]   Paul also, he was a designer, I guess.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.540]   He was in web design.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.500]   And the whole book is about,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.780]   instead of expanding your company,
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.100]   so companies that begin with you and your skill,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.380]   instead of expanding it
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.860]   to hit those intrinsic markers of success,
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.940]   so size, revenue, then funding,
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.340]   his whole point is keep it small.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.780]   If you get more in demand, you can just charge more
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.460]   and therefore even work less.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.380]   Like actually, it can be a great engine
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.260]   for a lifestyle that you have a huge amount of autonomy over.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.460]   And I think it's a great model.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.580]   So in terms of your specific day,
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.180]   there's no right answer to the exact right way
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.540]   to move deep work around how many blocks to have.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.780]   I have a couple of things I'm gonna throw out there,
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.620]   a couple of heuristics,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.140]   and you can see which of these might stick.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.060]   I'm a big believer in these situations
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.460]   of doing meeting-free Monday and Friday, if you can.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.340]   So you just have the scheduling heuristic
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.460]   that client calls, client meetings,
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.180]   you know, whatever, I gotta call my accountant,
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.900]   we gotta, the IT person's upgrading some sort of software,
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.980]   whatever it is, nothing gets scheduled
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.340]   for Monday and Fridays.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.140]   That alone just changes the character of the week
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.420]   because it's like you have a four-day weekend,
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.220]   you're just deep working on Friday,
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.540]   you're deep working on Monday,
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.580]   you can really get lost in things.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.060]   So I think that can make a big difference.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.660]   And then the other thing I might suggest
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.380]   would be consolidating the deep work.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.820]   All right, deep work to lunch, meetings, clients,
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.020]   administrative stuff in the afternoon.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.860]   Trying to keep that together, keep that mindset going,
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.620]   and not have anything interspersed into that
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.420]   that's unrelated.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.100]   So those are two heuristics I've seen.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.700]   Would that graft well onto your current setup?
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.820]   - Some, yeah.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.100]   I really wanted to live more asynchronously
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.020]   when I started this company,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.180]   so I only have one meeting per week normally.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.780]   - All right, that's easy.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.620]   - Yeah, so that makes it easier,
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.660]   but that also is a lot more uncertainty
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.900]   in terms of should every day kind of be the same
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.420]   or kind of create more texture throughout the week.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.820]   But yeah, so you think that kind of training
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.620]   to do longer periods of deep work is better?
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.980]   - Yeah, I would do it first thing in the day,
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.820]   until lunch, maybe just make that be a standard.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.660]   And then the other thing I would do,
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.620]   I mean, you have a very enviable situation here.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.140]   You have a huge amount of autonomy
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.660]   in terms of demands on your time
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.180]   because of the way you set this up, so congratulations.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.300]   This is something I do during the summer.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.700]   Like when I'm a professor in the summer,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.020]   I'm like you all the time.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.260]   So I have many fewer obligations.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.180]   My time is very, very open.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.540]   And so I have the same concern about how to structure it.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.540]   It's deep work in the morning
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.420]   and then variable but clearly defined shutdowns.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.940]   That's another thing I lean into
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.660]   is I'm gonna time block out my afternoon.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.220]   I'll be clear about when my shutdown's
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.300]   gonna happen this afternoon.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.580]   And when I'm shutdown complete,
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.420]   I'm not working on work anymore.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.740]   That can be really early some days, right?
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.180]   So what this allows you to do is it's Tuesday.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.220]   I deep work till lunch and that went really well.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.460]   I don't have any particularly
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.940]   pressing administrative thing.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.820]   I'm gonna do a formal schedule shutdown ritual at one o'clock
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.900]   and because I recognize, hey, this day is done
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.020]   and I feel good about it,
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.540]   I can really lean into those other hours to do other things,
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.580]   completely unrelated to work or whatever.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.820]   And then on another day, you said, look,
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.620]   I got my call with my client
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.380]   and now I really gotta figure out whatever,
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.900]   this new software package.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.740]   And so this is gonna take me till five
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.460]   and I'll do the clear shutdown then.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.740]   But having the clearly defined shutdown each day,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.660]   I mean, allows you to really work with this variable
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.540]   workflow and take a lot more advantage
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.300]   of what it gives you.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.220]   I mean, maybe you wanna become a cinephile.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.380]   It's like, great, two days a week, I'm going to the movies,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.700]   the two o'clock show or whatever.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.140]   That's the type of thing you can do
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.180]   when you feel like I shut down,
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.620]   I feel comfortable shutting down,
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.780]   I'm looking at my schedule, this is good,
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.220]   I'm on track for things.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.620]   And so now I really have to figure out
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.180]   what to do with my time.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.900]   That's what I might also be concerned about
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.060]   if I was you, is making sure it's not this hazy mix
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.020]   of work and non-work guilt in the afternoon.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.060]   Like, I don't know, maybe I should go back on email,
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.660]   what's going on.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.460]   Be clear about it, but then be very comfortable
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.860]   taking advantage of all the advantages you have.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.740]   - Okay, great.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.100]   Another kind of question along the lines
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.580]   of slow productivity is, should I work on weekends?
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.020]   So I'm trying to do some client work and some personal work.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.140]   So I am not sure if I should continue working on weekends.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.340]   Right now I'm taking one day off per week,
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.140]   but I think there could be value in getting more done.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.420]   So how do you think about working on weekends?
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.860]   - Would it be the personal project
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.700]   that you're mainly doing on the weekends?
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.980]   - Yeah.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.180]   - I think it's fine.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.820]   I mean, if you have the time and you find it interesting,
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   I think you're smart to take,
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.300]   whether it be Saturday or Sunday,
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.380]   a full day completely off is fine.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.060]   But if you're working on a personal project,
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.900]   I think that's fine.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.860]   I typically will write on Sundays, for example.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.500]   I don't do any other work on the weekend.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.660]   So I'm not gonna do, I'm not gonna do CS work.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.100]   Producer Jesse knows I'm probably not gonna answer emails
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.100]   about issues with the podcast, whatever, but I do write.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.460]   Because it's a very personal activity for me.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.580]   It's meaningful to me.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.580]   It doesn't change me into a mindset
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.140]   of hyperactive hive mind.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.460]   So I think if your personal project
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.260]   is not throwing you back into a world
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.940]   of scheduling meetings and sending emails,
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.660]   but it's coding or is trying to master a new system,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.740]   I think that's completely fine.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.820]   I mean, if you enjoy it, go for it.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.660]   Keep you one day off.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.460]   I mean, I think you got this pretty well dialed in here,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.980]   Philip, from what I'm hearing.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.140]   - So one of the life buckets is community.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.940]   I've moved around a lot.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.860]   I was a nomad for two years and I'm temporarily
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.780]   in a new city with my significant others
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.660]   in grad school.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.780]   How do you think community should factor in
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.220]   for somebody in my situation?
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.220]   I think there's not a lot of local people
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.180]   that are in the same situation as me,
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.180]   but a lot of online communities tend to be more real time,
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.460]   like Discord or Telegram.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.260]   And I don't wanna have those kind of synchronous demands
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.460]   on my attention.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.500]   What do you think is a good way to kind of continue
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.460]   to have some community?
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.180]   'Cause I don't really have that from coworkers
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.780]   or from kind of other companies in the same situation
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.820]   through an investor or something like that.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.020]   - What city are you in?
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.180]   - I'm in Chicago.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.020]   - Oh, okay.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.460]   I mean, I think you should have community involvements.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.700]   I think they should have scheduled synchronous demands
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.380]   on your time, and I think they should be in person.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.660]   I think that's an important part of the human condition.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.500]   And as I talk about in digital minimalism,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.180]   it's actually the non-trivial sacrifice of time
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.580]   and attention on behalf of other people
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.900]   that makes that connection something
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.700]   that's valued by your brain.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.700]   And so I would put in that work now.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.460]   Now, are you saying your significant other
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.620]   is in grad school somewhere else,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.460]   or you came to Chicago because-
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.420]   - I'm here.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.300]   - Okay, that's good.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.780]   - Yeah, we're here in Chicago, she's in school.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.700]   I think I agree with what you're saying.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.140]   I think what I'm having trouble with is finding peers.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.980]   - Oh, that's hard.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.260]   - There's a lot of people that are more advanced
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.580]   or learning from me.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.340]   But I think where I find I have issues
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.980]   is a lot of my kind of peers that I know
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.460]   are in other cities, not necessarily locally.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.140]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I'm saying get entangled
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.820]   in some community involvement here unrelated to your work.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.500]   - Okay, that makes sense.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.140]   - Yeah, I mean, it could be through fitness,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.100]   it could be through faith, it could be through activity,
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.620]   whatever, trail running or whatever.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.460]   I mean, there's such a wide variety,
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.340]   but I would anchor myself right away
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.500]   with, or if you're into, I mentioned movie,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.420]   you're into movies, like let me find a club
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.020]   that meets and does these things.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   And that becomes the offshoot of making friends
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.580]   and people you end up spending time with one-on-one.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.340]   I think that's really critical.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.140]   I would recognize it's hard, right?
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.060]   Because we don't have like an app solution for that.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.420]   We can't just like swipe a thing
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.860]   and then like a friend comes over.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.900]   But I would put a lot of effort into that,
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.460]   especially if I'm new to a city.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.860]   And you have the time and flexibility to do this.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.700]   And I think that's a great investment of the time you have.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.740]   - Yeah, I've done a good job of meeting friends
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   and communities locally,
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.260]   but I think the thing that I'm finding hardest
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.220]   kind of being solo is like professional peers
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.260]   and people that are working on similar problems
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.540]   and things like that.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.740]   So I've considered kind of like setting up
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.820]   like a mastermind call or something weekly
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.660]   with some people that are working on similar things here.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.140]   I think that's really kind of the main thing
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.340]   that I'm concerned about is meeting other people
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.020]   that also think this isn't as crazy
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.380]   and that are going through kind of similar
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.060]   professional challenges or things like that.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.260]   Yeah. - Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.660]   I mean, I think that could be helpful.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.140]   Writers have the same issue.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.060]   It's a very lonely job.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.340]   You don't go to an office and it's weird.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.820]   Like most people aren't writers, so it's hard to find.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.980]   And I've done something similar.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.580]   I've been involved in various writers groups.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.380]   I mean, in my sense, the value falls out of those
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.220]   is not the fact that we're getting together on Zoom
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.100]   every other week, it's the six months in,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.740]   this particular member of the group you kind of connect with
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.100]   and now there's someone you text with.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.620]   Now there's someone that like you see when they're in town.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.820]   So I see your question better now.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.040]   I would say it's worth it having the,
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.140]   you talked about the synchronous commitment,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.980]   make the commitment.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.220]   I think that's fine. - Yeah.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.580]   - Get together some groups.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.500]   Yeah, they're usually mixed.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.480]   These groups are okay, but it's like who you meet
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.100]   in the group could be pretty valuable.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.180]   So I see what you're saying there.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.740]   But on the other hand, hey, as a writer,
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.860]   I can say it is pretty lonely.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.020]   I mean, I know other writers, but it's a pretty,
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.440]   it could be a pretty lonely job and that's just part of it.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.860]   So you find connection outside.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.780]   I mean, look, I built this studio so I can come hang out
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.180]   with people because otherwise I'm just writing by myself,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.220]   but also having my Georgetown position.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.720]   I noticed a really big difference
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.620]   when the campus opened again, for example, post COVID.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.780]   Like, oh, just being able to come here, be around people.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.020]   So I think that is really valuable.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.020]   It's also just really hard.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.580]   I just know a lot of writers who,
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.980]   some of them meet other writer friends,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.420]   but it's a weird job.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.740]   Your situation might be similar.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.340]   So I think it's worth it to try those groups.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.180]   It might help.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.460]   You might meet some people,
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.260]   but I think you need to be okay with the fact
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.380]   that you may not ever have the same experience
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.780]   as the other person you know,
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.900]   who's in the 30 person venture-backed startup
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.120]   and they're in the office 12 hours a day.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.300]   And it's, you know, here's the ping pong table
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.380]   and we're just getting after it.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.380]   You know, it is a little bit more lonely.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.500]   I think Paul Jarvis is great about that in that book
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.540]   because he moved to the middle of nowhere.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.580]   I mean, he lives, I don't know, in the woods.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.620]   He lives in the woods in British Columbia somewhere,
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.060]   but they love it, but it's like completely different.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.900]   I mean, they're on their own
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.420]   if they're doing their own thing.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.540]   And so you can be happy with that too.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.780]   So I basically am validating your pain here, Philip.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.700]   It is hard and you can probably,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.060]   you might be able to do better,
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.560]   but I don't want to sugar coat it.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.460]   Like when you do a solo-preneur type situation like this,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.820]   I think a lot of your community connection
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.140]   comes outside of work.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.060]   - Yeah.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.300]   How do you think about coaches?
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.820]   I think coaching is kind of having a moment right now
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.100]   and I've had some friends recommend
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.140]   hiring like a professional coach.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.620]   I think that also kind of factors into accountability
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.620]   that on some of the client projects,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.860]   I feel like I can be working harder for someone else
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.340]   than I work for myself.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.680]   Do you think, like, how do you think about coaching?
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.900]   - I think you should try it.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.900]   Yeah, do a six month engagement
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.560]   that like, this is what we're trying.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.980]   So it's more like you re-up,
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.180]   not that you would have to actually cancel it yourself
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.620]   to see if it's a good fit or not.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.500]   I have a coach.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:29.300]   It is someone, she specializes in dealing with creatives
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.340]   who also are struggling with the issues
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.980]   of the business side of being a creative.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.720]   So, I mean, it is a very narrow expertise
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.440]   that I need a lot of help on.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.820]   So she works with writers and filmmakers
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.500]   and screenwriters and directors
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.340]   and where businesses build up
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.780]   around their creative endeavors.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.580]   And I found that to be really useful.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.500]   So I would say I'm on board with coaching.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.540]   Not every coach is gonna be a fit.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.200]   So try it out, but absolutely invest in that
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.540]   because you can get a huge return on that investment
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.940]   if it really changes the way you think about your business,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.860]   the way you think about your life.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.780]   So yeah, you got my stamp of approval on that.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.180]   I think there should be more coaching in general.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.620]   And I think you're right, it's having a moment
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.940]   where people are realizing I do a high-end job.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.900]   There's a lot at stake.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.600]   It's complicated.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.260]   There's huge dividends to get in my life
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.540]   if I could make big changes.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.820]   I don't quite know how to do that.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.580]   If there's someone who can help me through that,
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.980]   it could massively change the trajectory of my life.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.920]   I'll hire a trainer, I'll hire a doctor,
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.880]   I'll hire all these other things.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.460]   Why am I not hiring someone that's gonna work
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.060]   on probably the most important thing I do,
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.460]   which is sort of figuring out exactly
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.780]   how my career unfolds.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.620]   So yeah, you got my approval on that one too.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.220]   - Awesome, thanks a lot.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.980]   - Great, well, Philip, thanks for calling in.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.860]   I think it was a good case study
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.700]   and a good constellation of related questions.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.220]   So definitely keep us posted on how things are going
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.860]   for you there in Chicago.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.540]   - Will do, thanks, Kyle. - All right, thanks.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.700]   (upbeat music)
