[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - How do we love our neighbors
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.160]   when they don't really need us?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.900]   Worse, how do we love our neighbors
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.020]   when those neighbors go out of their way to ignore us?
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.880]   It's today's question.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.800]   Hello, Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.240]   This podcast has been a huge blessing in my life.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.640]   I'm a 25 year old man.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.600]   Last year, I moved into a new house in a new neighborhood.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.920]   As a brother in Christ, I choose to be respectful
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.060]   and greet my neighbors first
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.520]   because I don't want them to view me as arrogant, selfish,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.680]   or think I'm better than them.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.760]   In scripture, Jesus says to love your neighbors yourself.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.240]   Living in this neighborhood for almost a year now,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   I feel unwelcomed.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.820]   I wave at my neighbors just to show I care for them.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.880]   Instead of acknowledging me, they ignore me,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.080]   or a couple of times, they have mocked me back.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.360]   I began to ignore them back
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.140]   because I don't want them to steal my joy.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.360]   Pastor John, how do I obey Jesus's command
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.500]   to love my neighbors when my neighbors basically ignore me?
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.180]   Let me say a big yes and a big no
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.180]   to a quote from this question.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.180]   He says, "I wave at my neighbors just to show I care.
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.980]   Instead of acknowledging me, they ignore me,
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.060]   or a couple of times, they mocked me back,
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.060]   and I began to ignore them back
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.880]   because I don't want them to steal my joy."
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.420]   So here's my yes and no.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.380]   The yes is this.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.860]   I don't want them to steal my joy.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.980]   Amen, amen, yes, yes.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.880]   Absolutely don't let them steal your joy.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.300]   Yes.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.380]   The no is this.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.780]   I began to ignore them back.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.540]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.220]   That is not the strategy to protect
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.420]   and deepen and lengthen your joy.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.420]   So let me say a word about the yes and the no from the Bible.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.140]   First, the yes.
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.380]   I don't want them to steal my joy.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.380]   I'm with you all the way, because in John 16, 22,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.220]   Jesus said to his disciples who were sorrowful
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.840]   that he was about to leave them be crucified,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.500]   and they didn't understand what was going on.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   He said, "You have sorrow now, but I will see you again,
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.540]   and your hearts will rejoice,
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.540]   and no one will take your joy from you."
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.500]   So yes, not gonna happen.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.340]   Don't let it happen.
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.820]   This is a good desire and a good confidence
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.720]   and a good goal.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.180]   A Christian's joy is rooted in Christ,
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.620]   who he is, what he's done, and that joy cannot be taken.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.620]   It has a deeper, stronger anchor than any other joy.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.980]   No one will take your joy from you, Jesus said.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.980]   In fact, this deep, unshakable joy
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.740]   that's not dependent on external circumstances
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.820]   like being waved at or being insulted,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.660]   but is anchored in the all-satisfying Christ,
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.340]   same yesterday, today, and forever,
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.340]   that joy is exactly what we have to offer our neighbors.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.320]   Their joy rises and falls according to circumstances.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.260]   Our joy is not like that.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.380]   Our joy is anchored in unchangeable glory.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.400]   We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, Romans 5, 2.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.100]   Therefore, even when we are sorrowful,
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.820]   which is real for Christians,
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.420]   even when we are sorrowful,
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.200]   for example, at being rejected by our neighbors,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   Paul says, "We are sorrowful, yet always rejoicing,"
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.460]   2 Corinthians 6:10.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.380]   Those unsociable, even hostile neighbors
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.180]   might feel to you like a thorn in your flesh.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.460]   But here's what Paul says about thorns in his flesh.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.900]   When he asked Jesus to take the thorn away,
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.480]   and I'm sure you have asked that,
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.580]   Jesus responded, "My grace is sufficient for you,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.200]   "for my power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.860]   And then Paul says in response,
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.700]   "I will boast all the more gladly."
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.640]   (laughs)
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.340]   Oh, Paul, "I will boast all the more gladly
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.800]   "of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.120]   "may rest upon me."
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.920]   And then he adds, "For the sake of Christ, then,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   "I am content."
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.360]   So he's got gladness, he's got contentment
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.160]   with weaknesses and insults, insults.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.200]   "For when I am weak, then am I strong."
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.560]   That's 2 Corinthians 12, nine to 10.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.200]   So you can see that Paul absolutely
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.220]   would not let thorns rob him of his joy.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.760]   "All the more gladly will I boast in my weaknesses.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.680]   "I am content with insults,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.840]   "with neighbors who ignore me or ridicule me."
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   That's a miracle.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.760]   We gotta pray for that miracle in our lives.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.000]   So yes, yes, yes, don't let anyone rob you
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.560]   of your Christ-exalting joy.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   Now, a word about the no.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.880]   The strategy of returning ignoring for ignoring,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.480]   or insult for insult, is not gonna work, period.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.520]   No, that's not the way Jesus designed for you
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.920]   to protect your joy.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.700]   We do it.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.100]   I know the feeling.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.400]   I just run away from those things that take my joy.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.720]   No, that's not the solution if love is at stake.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.600]   Just the opposite.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.920]   If you join them in their strategies,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.060]   the reward you will get is the pleasures they get.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.000]   And you'll hear Jesus say, "You have your reward."
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.840]   And that's that.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.040]   Of course, there is a kind of pleasure.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.020]   There is.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.160]   In returning insult for insult and ignoring for ignoring,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.660]   there is a sinful pleasure.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.240]   And it's a real pleasure in feeling
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.800]   like you've had the last word,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.600]   or feeling like you're so above the other people's criticism
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.420]   that you don't even feel it.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.560]   There you go.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.480]   You may insult me, I don't feel it.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.600]   So there.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.320]   That's not a Christian strategy.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.920]   That's a Stoic strategy for maintaining joy.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   Here's Paul's strategy.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.000]   1 Corinthians 4.12.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.120]   When reviled, we bless.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.480]   When persecuted, we endure.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.120]   When slandered, we entreat.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.440]   Or he might say, when ignored, we smile and wave.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.360]   Now, how can that be a strategy for joy?
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.800]   Because Jesus said in Acts 20.35,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.680]   "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.360]   There is a pleasure in receiving greetings.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.960]   It's good, it's beautiful.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.420]   We want it.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.740]   But Jesus says there's a deeper pleasure
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.160]   in giving greetings.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.760]   I remember 48 years ago,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.880]   when I was working on my dissertation,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.720]   my doctoral dissertation on Jesus' command
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.360]   to love your enemies.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.520]   And I read articles and books on loving your enemies.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.280]   And there was this constant effort
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   to resist individualizing enemy love
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.760]   and the desire to turn it into
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.640]   not nitty gritty practical little daily things,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   but big social issues of the day.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.080]   That's where enemy love really counts.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.040]   And I remember responding in one of those interchanges
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   that I had by simply pointing to Matthew 5.47.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.080]   I mean, texts are wonderful.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.000]   (both laughing)
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.640]   In debate with other.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.200]   So I just went to Matthew 5.47,
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   where Jesus illustrates what he means
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.820]   by love your enemies with this sentence.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.360]   "If you greet only your brothers,
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.000]   what are you doing more than others?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.960]   Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.440]   That conversation was over.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.600]   (both laughing)
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   Like greeting your enemy as you pass him on the street
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.440]   with a smile and a hello
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.700]   is not exactly your great social issue of the day.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.280]   (laughs)
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.060]   It just happens to be tremendously important
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.360]   in the mind of Jesus.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.180]   Why?
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.080]   Because it reveals our hearts.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   So I would say to our 25 year old friend
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.120]   in his new neighborhood,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.040]   don't grow weary in well-doing.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.600]   And the more your neighbors feel like enemies,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   the more you should love them the way Jesus said.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.000]   And one of those ways is greeting.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.480]   If you only greet those who greet you,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.640]   how are you acting like a son of God
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.280]   and not just like everybody else?
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   And let me just add one more practical suggestion.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.840]   These greetings and other little kindnesses
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.040]   that you may do thanklessly
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.720]   may feel to you like throwing money down a rat hole,
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.520]   but if you manifest the compassion of Christ
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.600]   and the steadfast goodwill of Christ over time,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   what might happen is that when crisis or tragedy
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.800]   strikes one of your neighbors,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.360]   you may be the one they turn to.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.960]   So be alert to the moment when they're not so cocky
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.280]   because all is going well.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.440]   Instead, they're hurting because something terrible
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.120]   just happened in their lives.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.560]   And then they may turn to you
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.720]   because you may seem to them
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.000]   to be somebody who might care.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.840]   Who knows how many small evidences of grace like greetings
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.120]   become the very thing,
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.880]   the door through which they might welcome you
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.760]   into their lives.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.600]   Amen.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.920]   I've actually seen that very thing happen
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.040]   in my own neighborhood twice recently.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.080]   Thank you for joining us today.

[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.640]   While the great C.S. Lewis once called purgatory
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.160]   a self-confirming reality,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   purgatory is just logical.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.320]   We all must get cleaned up before we enter into eternity.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.840]   Well, no, it's not such a logical conclusion after all.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.160]   We're gonna look at purgatory
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.200]   and how C.S. Lewis got it wrong next time
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.120]   when we return on Monday.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.480]   It's an important topic.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   We'll see you back here on the other side of the weekend.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.360]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:56.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
