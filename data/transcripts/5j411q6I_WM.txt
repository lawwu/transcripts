[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.160]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 195.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.000]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800]   I was late today.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.600]   We're late getting started.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.160]   Jesse, my apologies.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.640]   I had the AC repair people coming out to do maintenance and we discovered all sorts of
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   issues.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.400]   Long story short, 45-minute appointment became two and a half hours.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.240]   So I have been up to my ears literally, I suppose, and free on.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.000]   I'll tell you though, and I've mentioned this to you before, Jesse, I am obsessed with my
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.600]   AC in my current house and my old house.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   I've never had it work the way I want it to work.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.720]   I've never just had it cycles on and off, like reasonable length cycles, keeps up on
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.720]   hot days.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.040]   There's always weirdness going on.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.240]   I am this close to taking, I think, a year-long sabbatical from Georgetown, putting all my
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.760]   writing projects on hold to just full-time work on my AC.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.520]   Doesn't Tesla have a heating system coming out?
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.640]   You could buy one of those now that you're boys with Elon.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640]   That's what I should do.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.440]   I'm going to do it, whatever the most complicated expensive, but it's true about HVAC.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.120]   You could spend your entire life obsessing about HVAC to try to get it right.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.720]   So we're now rebuilding a very old unit.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.160]   We're starting from scratch and rebuilding our upstairs AC from scratch, re-insulating
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.240]   everything, trying to perfectly size the unit to it.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.960]   I mean, I literally could give this, I would say 50% of my time and would be happy.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.800]   And I could solve this problem so that it's a hot DC summer day and the upstairs AC is
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.720]   coming off and on, but not even thinking about it, not worried about it, not going from vent
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.960]   to vent, checking the temperature, trying to see what's going on.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   Is it leaking?
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   Is it old?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   I mean, I would be a happy man.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.120]   So I'm just going to dedicate a huge amount of time.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.600]   And then one day the AC will just work and I'll be lost.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.000]   Because you like a cold, right?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.720]   I like a cold and also just a work.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.280]   This house, but also in my last house, we just had this maddening thing where maybe
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.760]   this is the way ACs are supposed to work, but it would just be on and on and on.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120]   And I'd be like, well, shouldn't it be cycling off and on?
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.160]   Like, can't we just make it powerful enough that on like a reasonably hot day it's cycling
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   off and on.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.240]   But it's always been that even on a somewhat hot day, our AC just runs and runs.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.760]   It's like, this is not other people's ACs don't do this.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   Like something's not right.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   It's not powerful enough.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.680]   It's not big enough.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.200]   And I want to dedicate my time.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.760]   That's where I want to dedicate my time.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.480]   Just have a beautifully balanced, perfectly proportioned variable speed system.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   That's just well suited.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.600]   The reality is I live in a very tall house and it, I mean, you've seen it, we're on a
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.840]   hill.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.720]   So the front of the house at the top of the hill is a normal height.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.100]   And then the hill drops away, fully exposing the basement.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.800]   And so it's just like a 30 foot tall, like just tower that just the sun beats on just
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   a box.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.880]   And it's a big old, like early, very early 20th century house where it's very narrow
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   roof.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.520]   So it's just like a straight up and that thing just bakes.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.340]   But anyways, I think what we need to do, and you would agree with this is our new podcast
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.900]   that was supposed to be mainly about sports and fantasy novels will now have a Ask Cal
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.420]   about AC segment.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.420]   I like it.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   Nothing crazy.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.700]   I'm talking just like a tight 45 minutes every episode.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.620]   Just me talking about Freon levels and balance and return rates.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.100]   So oh man, I'm going to fix this problem though.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.660]   AC in here works fine.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.660]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.660]   You like it.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.660]   I mean, it gets cold in here.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.300]   So a little bit inside the curtain and not to dwell on this, but the studio is probably
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.260]   the warmest room in the office because we only have this one little vent and we have
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.420]   people in here and we have all these curtains up.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.980]   So to make the studio broadcasting cool, and if you've been on, you know, I've done a bunch
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.280]   of TV and et cetera, it's cool because you don't want to sweat on TV.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.900]   You have to make the rest as Jesse will attest.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.580]   The rest of the HQ has to be an icebox, but we have our own unit here, which is what's
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.460]   nice is we there's just our own AC unit.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.800]   It's in the closet.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.520]   It just runs us.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.020]   This is how I justified safety concerns when I moved over to this HQ, like way early in
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.100]   the pandemic, I was like, it's fine.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.020]   We have our own air handling system.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.300]   That was the way I thought about it.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.220]   It's not like we're sharing because that's the type of stuff we worried about in spring
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   of 2020.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.660]   It's like, well, what if the air from the other offices are going to like bring virus
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.660]   in or this or that?
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660]   And we were worried about it back then.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.820]   And so I was like, you know, we have our own HVAC in here.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.820]   It's we're in our own closed loop.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.300]   So yeah, the AC here works fine.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.340]   All right, Jesse, enough about that.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.820]   Um, actually we did get a email from Carl.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.860]   He's a big fan.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.620]   Was it about air conditioner?
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.620]   It wasn't, but it should be.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.740]   Well, then I'm not interested.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.500]   But he actually, he's been emailing me and he was interested in when you're talk about
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.740]   the algorithm, when you were talking about the Obama call for more regulation for during
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.260]   one of our Cal reacts to the news.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.860]   So he thought it was enlightening and he's like talking about the algorithm and how it's
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.820]   like one of the worst things about social media.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.420]   And he'd like to kind of hear you talk about that more.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.620]   And he's even wondering why an algorithm is even needed.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.620]   Yes.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.980]   Um, so if you could just dive into that a little bit, that's interesting.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.460]   I mean, there's two things about the algorithm.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.220]   One is it's not an algorithm, right?
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.860]   So we're going to get a little bit more precise with our terminology.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.980]   Uh, I'm teaching algorithms for example, this semester and an algorithm technically is you,
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.220]   you have a finite sequence of unambiguous steps that are executed in a clear control
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.420]   order.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.020]   It's way more ambiguous what goes on with social media.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.500]   So instead of really an algorithm, think about it as a, a large bank of black boxes that
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.060]   takes in lots of information and then using that information helps make decisions about
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.980]   what should we show this particular user.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.220]   It's actually assigning weights to different possible things to figure out which tweet
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.780]   to show this user, which Facebook newsfeed posts to prioritize.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.740]   And what is actually happening to these black boxes is not just a single algorithm that
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.780]   you can study.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.600]   It's really for the most part, a collection of mainly neural nets.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.820]   So you have, you have neural networks that are trained through back propagation to try
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.660]   to essentially learn what it is that appeals to you and what doesn't, but it's not just
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.740]   one neural net.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.100]   There's multiple different neural nets that do different things.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.160]   And then their feedback is fed into each other in somewhat complicated ways.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.900]   And so it's a real, almost intractable mess of black boxes connected together in complex
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.900]   manner.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.460]   So it's this real complicated mess of different networks hooked up to each other that in the
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.980]   end spits out its recommendations in the terms of weights of show this tweet, not that.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.380]   So it's completely obfuscated.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.660]   It's very difficult to try to find out what is going on inside those networks.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.420]   I mean, if you want to really get into neural networks, I mean, what they're really doing
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.700]   is they're, they're really, as we've talked about before, but they're, they're, they're
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:42.180]   essentially building spaces like regions and multi-dimensional space that they can associate.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.140]   So this is what a standard, I don't want to get too far down this, but a standard, not
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.620]   many layer neural net was, is basically just building up the space in which the inputs
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.140]   exist into these different regions.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.140]   So it can categorize things.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.980]   And then when you get something like a deep learning neural net, you have multiple layers
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.780]   that are each doing something like that.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.380]   And then they're communicating to each other.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.540]   So one layer might look at a picture and just be really good at figuring out where the straight
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.300]   edges are and how many there are.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.140]   And then another layer takes that input is really good at figuring out, well, if there's
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.660]   this many straight edges, then it's probably a crosswalk.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.940]   And so it all gets kind of complicated, but that's what I want to emphasize is complicated.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.660]   So it's not an algorithm we can tweak easily.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.800]   It's not an algorithm we can understand easily.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.580]   Can we get rid of that in social media?
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.620]   I mean, we, we can imagine that being true.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.120]   We can imagine that being true because we used to have social media without these quote
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.360]   unquote algorithms.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   This was basically all social media before 2009.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.720]   So if you use Twitter in 2007, there's no complicated algorithm involved in showing
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.940]   what you see.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:54.060]   All it did was sort of all the people you follow here, their tweets, sort them in chronological
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.660]   order, but the newest one at the top, Facebook was doing the same thing.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.900]   You have different people that you, I don't know what their terminology was.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.900]   You'd like, you friend.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.100]   See, people don't even talk about this on Facebook anymore.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.700]   It's just become this newsfeed distraction machine, but you know, you would friend people
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.940]   and would look at what they were posting and put it in chronological order is what people
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.700]   were posting.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.860]   And then at some point after that, as we've talked about before, you get these complex
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.620]   neural network based algorithms that say, well, I'm not just going to show you things
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.700]   in chronological chronological order.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.980]   I'm going to prioritize things that are going to increase engagement, which means time on
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.220]   service.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.860]   And that's where we get this complicated play where we no longer understand how it shows
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.500]   us what it shows us.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.180]   Many of the impacts that the switch to this quote unquote algorithmic sorting of social
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.420]   media content had like many of the issues of this were unexpected.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   There's side effects.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.180]   Like all you're trying to do with these networks, these neural nets all connected together is
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.820]   just to make the user happier in the sense of I want to spend more time looking at this.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.060]   But I had all sorts of side effects.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.860]   And I think one of the big ones is what we talked about when we covered John Heights
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.380]   Atlantic article from a few weeks ago.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.260]   And it was it introduced intense virality.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.780]   Because now I could post something, other people could start spreading it.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.360]   The algorithm will see that it's popular.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.700]   So it's going to start showing it to more people, which gives it a chance to be even
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.700]   more popular.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.180]   And you can have explosive virality.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:30.300]   And Heights point was explosive explosive virality led to a environment that was high
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.940]   stakes and terrifying.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:38.540]   You could be a hero or canceled in 12 hours, you know, just like, boom, it could just happen.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.820]   And that completely changed who you social media, how they used it.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.940]   Another issue with these type of algorithms had to do with I talked about this in digital
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.940]   minimalism, but it made it way less predictable about what reaction you were going to get
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.940]   to your pieces.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.540]   And that also touched on just social psychology, the intermittent reinforcement of sometimes
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.300]   people like what I do, and sometimes people don't.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.580]   That became a real addictive factor in getting people back, especially for Instagram and
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.260]   Facebook in the earlier days of these algorithms is now that when people could like and things
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:15.700]   could be shared, you had this much more unpredictable and unstable environment of feedback.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   And that was very addictive.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.940]   Like, are people going to like this?
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.260]   Are people not going to like this?
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.500]   So it's possible.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.900]   But there's no reason why companies would because Carl, it makes them way more, way
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.980]   more profitable.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.500]   It's fantastically more profitable.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.940]   People use these services all the time because they are perfectly optimized to get you to
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.980]   do that.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:46.060]   If you went back to 2007 Facebook, it is way more boring than 2022 Facebook.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.260]   If you go back to Twitter, early Twitter, before they began building these algorithmically
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.420]   juiced timelines, it was a way more boring place.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.100]   Like most of what you saw was not interesting because most of what most people you follow
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.340]   post is not post is not interesting.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.740]   So it's good for us as a culture because it was a diversion.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.080]   We don't want to spend too much time on, but it's a completely different beast.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.860]   And I believe the timeline was Facebook made that move.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:19.980]   I mean, Twitter made that move first and then Facebook and Instagram followed.
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:27.220]   So when they saw when Facebook saw Twitter move away from a strict chronological timeline,
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.340]   Facebook realized they had to do something similar.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.780]   So now I don't know if that genie is going to go back in the bottle for those companies
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:37.340]   because I mean, it would be like going to an oil company, like going to Exxon and saying,
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.860]   I know you've, you've invented these technologies, which allows you to get 10 X more oil out
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.580]   of the ground per day.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.940]   But could you stop using them?
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.780]   And they're probably going to say, no, they're probably gonna say, no, like, you know, this
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.380]   is our main technology, we can oil the ground.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.480]   We got, we've gotten really good at it.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.260]   We don't want to artificially go back to a time when we were worse at it.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.260]   So it's interesting.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.620]   You know, I got another email about that segment.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:06.660]   So that that particular article, the reacting to Obama's call to regulate social media.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.380]   And I mentioned section 230.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:16.540]   So there's this rule on the books called section 230 of this larger legislation that has a
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.260]   big impact in that it protects.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:25.260]   So we talked about it protects platforms from liability for what other users are posting
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.020]   on the platforms.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.020]   And it was invented.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.940]   We talked about this before it was the intent was thinking about comments.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   You know, I have a blog, it's 2008 of a comment section, and maybe someone's going to come
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.820]   along and leave a comment on that section that is, you know, violate some laws like
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:51.060]   revealing insider trading or conducting libel against someone or something like this.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   Right.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.660]   And section 230, very crudely speaking, would say, I'm not responsible for that.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.820]   I just had a comment board, but I'm not the editor selecting information.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.820]   And the idea was these large social media platforms were using that coverage to say,
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.100]   look, we're not we're not an editor.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.100]   Right.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.340]   So we can't be held liable for what people actually say on it.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.140]   And so there's one of the pushes for regulation is to get rid of that protection and say,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.620]   no, you are liable for what's posted on your platform, just like a newspaper is liable
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:22.620]   for what they print and that this might lead to more aggressive or more effective content
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.620]   moderation.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:30.100]   I said I might be interested in it just because anything that would lead social media to fragment
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.740]   and have to have to become more niche, I thought would be good.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.180]   Anyways, I got an email from a lawyer who used to specialize in section 230.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.500]   Long story short, Jesse, he was basically saying.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.300]   It's a tricky path to go down.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:50.500]   He's like, if you pull up to 30 and you do so because you want to, there's an impact
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.780]   you want on these very large social media companies, he said, actually, they would probably
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.940]   be OK.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:01.680]   They can afford the legal expertise to try to walk around and sidestep these liabilities
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.320]   and that like small people are going to get hurt.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.740]   It's going to be, you know, Cal Newport dot com.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.860]   Like it really could be a problem for smaller companies.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.100]   So look, I'm not a lawyer, but it's an interesting note.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.140]   And he's like, it's just complicated.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.540]   So there you go.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.980]   Good question, though, Carl.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.100]   Yeah, I like people emailing.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   Jesse is Jesse at Cal Newport dot com.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.940]   He loves to hear about the show.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.820]   What you like, what you don't like.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.820]   J.E.S.S.E.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.820]   J.E.S.S.E.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.820]   At Cal Newport dot com.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.820]   Somebody asked about that.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   That's the only reason why I threw that in there.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.300]   Yeah, it's not it's not G.E.S.S.E.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.420]   Why is it so I saw Jesse's spell with I.E.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.420]   Fair enough.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   Fair enough.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.860]   So that was from that was someone asking about an older reacts to the new section segment.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.300]   I thought we would do a brief Cal reacts to a new segment about a new article today.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.700]   What I.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:05.020]   I think I without exaggeration can say probably like one of the most important articles published.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.940]   Let's be modest here, but look at the last.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.700]   Decade.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.540]   And that is an article that appeared in The New Yorker last week.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.620]   So you're hearing this on a Monday.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.500]   It appeared the Monday before it was an article written by this young buck named Cal Newport.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.020]   I'm joking.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.620]   This is not one of the most important articles of the decade, but I did after a bit of a
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.180]   hiatus have returned to the page of The New Yorker, published an article about Elon Musk
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.180]   and Twitter.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.180]   We should talk about it briefly.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.740]   I'm not going to talk about in depth because honestly, you've heard through various segments
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.820]   we've done on this podcast.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.940]   You are ahead of the curve listening to this podcast.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.060]   You have heard a lot of my ideas about Twitter and Musk's acquisition.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:52.100]   Well, I refined and polished my thoughts on this for a reaction piece that I wrote for
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.400]   The New Yorker.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.840]   It was titled our misguided obsession about Twitter.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.420]   And here's the here's the basic point.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.980]   Let me just give you the basic point.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:09.060]   When I looked around at the landscape of coverage of Elon Musk making his bid to acquire Twitter,
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:16.020]   what I noticed is that almost every reaction was unified by a belief that Twitter was very
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.580]   important.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.620]   Twitter is the digital town square.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.140]   That's the terminology Musk used himself in the official statement announcing the acquisition
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.220]   and everyone seemed to more or less agree.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:33.340]   Now once you agree that Twitter is the digital town square, then of course you are going
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.380]   to care a lot about exactly how Twitter operates.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:44.060]   If this is as most people who are writing about this believe, if this platform is where
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:51.980]   policy is set, if it's where the ultimate adjudication of goodness and badness of individuals,
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:57.180]   of ideas of organizations is made, if it's where activism gets its priorities, then even
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.300]   small changes to how it operates, the rules for content moderation, if you can go back
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.660]   and edit a tweet or not, who is kicked off, who's not kicked off and under what circumstances,
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:16.740]   the implicit norms that are being implemented by all these rules makes a huge difference.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:22.860]   So of course there'd be a big uproar about the ownership changing hands for this coming
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.020]   from a public company to a private company where one individual would suddenly have way
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.300]   control over this platform.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.900]   So almost everything I read came from that starting place.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.140]   And once you're in that starting place, you're either really worried, I'm really worried
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.540]   about Musk, I don't think he's on my team, I'm worried he's going to do things that's
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.340]   going to make this conversation worse, or you're gloating like this is great, I think
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.940]   Musk is going to do things we like and that's all you focused on.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.980]   I basically stepped away from that whole argument and said, forget the details of what Musk
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.460]   is or is not going to do to Twitter.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:59.500]   Let's actually poke for a second, this fundamental assumption that it is the digital town square.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:05.940]   And as you've heard me allude to in previous segments on this podcast, I do not believe
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.660]   that to be true.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:14.260]   I drew heavily from John Heights, recent Atlantic article, which helped to make the point using
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.540]   numbers that a lot of us just understand intuitively, those of us who monitor Twitter from a media
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.540]   perspective.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.980]   What we all understand intuitively is that the primary users on Twitter, the people who
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:30.420]   are doing all these tweets, who are doing takes and combating other people's takes,
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:36.260]   the grist of the mill that is the content mill that is Twitter, are not at all a broad
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.060]   representative sample of this country.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.020]   They tend to consolidate on the political extremes.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.460]   They also tend to be wider and richer than the average American.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.620]   Now, I didn't talk about this in the New Yorker article, but I did come across, I think,
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:59.460]   a related compelling quote from a George Washington University media studies professor who made
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.740]   this point that like, keep in mind, Twitter is a very demanding platform.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.100]   It is very difficult to be an active, successful user on Twitter, much more difficult than
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.760]   Instagram, much more difficult than TikTok.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.220]   It's basically a full time job.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.620]   You have to tweet a lot.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.420]   It's complicated to get the tweets right.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   It's this tightrope walk.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.540]   And so we really get this incredibly rarified group of gladiators from the different political
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.180]   extremes.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.620]   And because of the dynamics of the platform, this is what Haidt talks about.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.580]   They're in this context of virality, which means that they push themselves even farther
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.200]   to the extremes.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.340]   They're doing this high stylized combat back and forth.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.580]   And that spectacle is fascinating.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.780]   It's very engaging.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.500]   There's a whole periphery of people who like to watch it, but it's not the town square.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   It's not the town square.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.760]   It's the it's a coliseum.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.060]   And so my point is, once we recognize that, and this is the point I made in the article,
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.680]   the right response to all this uproar about Musk taking over Twitter is not, oh, my God,
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   what Musk is going to do?
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.140]   It's, oh, my God, why is everyone still paying attention to Twitter?
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.660]   This is where we actually need to put our attention is to look at people in positions
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:12.340]   of power who continue to look towards this gladiatorial, unrepresentative spectacle and
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.000]   use it to help guide their decision making and say, stop it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.780]   That's not real life.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.620]   This is not a representation about how the culture at large feels about this issue or
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.340]   this person or this idea.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:30.940]   So if you are a head of a academic institution, head of a company, if you're a politician,
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.760]   if you're a journalist, don't look over there.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.960]   It's exciting, but it has nothing to do with real life.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.660]   But when you look over there and use that to help influence what you do, the rest of
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.440]   us, the 95 percent of people who could care less what's happening on Twitter, we're impacted
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.580]   by the service.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.700]   We're impacted by that gladiatorial battle.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:54.740]   It's as if the Roman Senate was over at the coliseum and passing law that affected the
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:00.020]   entire empire based on what was happening on that bloody, sandy ground of the arena.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.140]   We would say that's a terrible way for you to figure out what you should do or shouldn't
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:08.380]   do, get out of there, go talk to the actual people, be among real, be among the rest of
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:14.100]   us, get away from the spectacle, ground yourself again so that we can all be working from a
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.420]   shared sense of common sense.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.780]   So that was basically my argument is who cares what Musk is going to do?
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:24.380]   What I care about is that all of you are paying attention to Twitter still and thinking that
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.260]   this is somehow a town square.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.060]   And I really don't think, I really don't think it is.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.060]   All right.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.900]   So that was my article.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.340]   This Jesse, I will say this might hurt our plan to get Musk on the show.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.340]   Not necessarily.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.340]   I think he's going to be on.
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.580]   You'll be chilling with him and Rogan.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:48.020]   He basically I'm saying 44, this is like a bad, if I'm right, it's a very bad investment
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.060]   because it would say, uh, you know, he's within the bubble that thinks that this is so critical.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.720]   And I'm basically trying to stand outside the bubble and say, it only seems critical
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.480]   to a small group of people, but it's not really.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.480]   And they need to change that.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.660]   They need to pay attention somewhere else.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.660]   And we're starting to see this.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.180]   I talked about in the article, something I talked about on the show, which was the New
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.860]   York times changing their policy, resetting their social media policy and saying, you
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.740]   know how before we told you reporters that you should be on social media, you should
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.100]   be on Twitter.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.100]   Nevermind.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.140]   Uh, don't use Twitter.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.600]   And if you really feel like you have to use Twitter, use it a lot less.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.020]   That's the, that's the right response this time.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.660]   Do you think Elon and Jack Dorsey talk a lot or at all?
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.060]   I don't know how well they know each other.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.620]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.980]   Do you think he called him before?
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980]   It's a good question.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.100]   I don't know.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:45.340]   I know Elon has tweeted back when Jack was in charge of Twitter on multiple occasions,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:52.580]   Elon got a ban or a temporary ban overturned by tweeting him, but that almost makes me
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:58.300]   feel like maybe they're not closer because he didn't call him privately and say, bring
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   this person back on.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.020]   Elon would just at Jack and be like, why is this person banned?
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.540]   And then the person, the person would get on band.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.500]   So yeah, that's, that's a, it's a good question.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.300]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.540]   So we'll see.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.100]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:20.120]   There's a Simpson episode, a tree house, a horror Halloween episode that this really
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.420]   reminds me of.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.700]   And the premise of this episode, so you remember tree house, a horror, it would be like ghost.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.540]   There'd be fantastical kind of Halloween scenarios.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.500]   It didn't take place in the actual universe of the Simpsons.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.900]   It was just these Halloween episodes.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:42.060]   And then one of them advertising figures like the, the brands, the brand figures, you know,
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.300]   Mr. Clean, right.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.460]   These types of brand figures came, came alive and they were giants or like the state put
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.340]   marshmallow man and they were sort of destroying Springfield.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.300]   And the solution to the problem that Lisa figured out was just to get people to stop
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.380]   paying attention to them.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.340]   And she sung this jingle with the help of Burt Bacharach and it was just called just
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.740]   don't look.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.300]   And that's how they, they stopped the attack on the, the very structure of the town itself
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.260]   was convincing the townspeople just don't pay attention to the advertising.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.980]   And obviously this is like a, it was like a clear metaphor, but don't pay attention
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.620]   to the giant advertising monsters and they, they all fall apart.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.960]   I mean, this is what I think this is where we've gotten with Twitter is we all just need
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.740]   to stop paying attention.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.860]   The power users are still going to be on there doing their weird stylized violence and warfare.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.780]   But if you just don't look, it doesn't have an impact on the town.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.840]   It doesn't destroy the buildings.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.340]   It sort of just becomes its own thing.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.460]   And again, I, and I make this point in the article, Twitter used to have a lot of good
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.020]   stuff that happened on there.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:52.260]   I mean, there was obviously the, the, the activism, the early toppling of dictators
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.220]   in the, in the Arab spring, we had the accountability played a big role in me too, but even beyond
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:03.100]   those sort of high value uses, the, the, the original core of what made Twitter interesting
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.980]   was there were smart people making interesting or funny takes.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.620]   It's like, here's a topic I kind of like, and I want to follow people who are smart
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.980]   and they're going to have these smart takes.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.020]   And then you, you have better takes and it's interesting and you can use those takes to
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.020]   make yourself feel smarter.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.680]   And then there's funny people doing funny takes like that was actually like a pretty
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   compelling mix.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.580]   But I really do believe it can't just be that anymore.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.780]   Viral dynamics pushed out all of the interesting people in the middle.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.340]   It left us with people on the political extremes.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.180]   It brought in this type of huge tribal warfare where it's about not giving ground to the
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.900]   other team and doing combat about them.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.860]   They're trying to come back to you and you're a hero and then you're canceled.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.380]   And I think those, this height was absolutely right about this.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.420]   Once those intense dynamics came into play, the idea that Twitter was just a place you
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.260]   could just go and here's some funny observations and here's some smart observations about this
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.620]   political issue.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.740]   And it's, it's quicker and pithier than waiting for the newspaper.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.740]   It can't be that anymore.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.700]   And I don't know how you get, I don't know how you would get it back.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.180]   I mean, we talked before about Galloway, Scott Galloway's idea about going to a subscription
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.180]   model.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.660]   Maybe that could get that back.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.980]   Maybe there's a way to tamp down virality so that you don't have these huge stakes.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.620]   Maybe there's a way to niche out Twitter so that like the community that's interested
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.660]   in sports talk or the community interested in comedy or the community interested in this
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.380]   particular political topic can be there and see interesting takes without it spiraling
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   out of control.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:29.220]   If you lower the stakes and I called it this sort of terrifying but thrilling combination
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.900]   of you could fall, you could make it across the tight rope and be fettered or you could
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.980]   fall and be splattered on the pavement.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.980]   It was like really compelling.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.100]   If you can lower the stakes and maybe it could be back to what it was before.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.100]   I mean, I see what the value was.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.700]   I just think it can't right now.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.500]   It just can't support that.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.500]   It's a bloodbath.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.820]   It's like, I use these analogies.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.780]   You had the theater, the Greek theater in which you're having the Aeschylus plays and
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.940]   then over time without people really noticing it transformed to the Coliseum and mixing
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.940]   Greek and Roman.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.080]   But I think the point gets across.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.020]   In terms of investment, he's bringing a private, right?
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.020]   He's bringing a private.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.020]   So, and I had to work out those numbers.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:16.020]   I mean, it's not in the context of mergers and acquisitions, just companies buying other
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.020]   companies.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.020]   This is not a notably large amount of money, 44 billion.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.020]   I mean, I think when Disney bought Fox, it was 185 billion.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:31.940]   Jack Dorsey just bought a FinTech company called Afterpay for like 30 billion, you know,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.300]   less than half a year ago, right?
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   It's similar, right?
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.020]   So, it's not that exceptional, but it is exceptional for a public company being bought completely
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.580]   to be made private.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.220]   And there, that's actually really, that's like way more rare.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.140]   And I think this might be, if I have my numbers, right, the second largest buyout of a public
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.140]   company.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.820]   So, that's like more unusual.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.420]   And there is some concern about the ability, which this makes sense to me, the ability
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.620]   for someone to have in theory so much money that they can just buy what we'd call like
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.940]   a moderate size public company and just take it private.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.980]   That's maybe that's something to be concerned about.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:12.540]   So, it's a very big buyout amount, not a very big just merger and acquisition amount.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:18.140]   So, it's not a huge company, but usually you don't have public companies even at that modest
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:25.180]   size completely bought out by, I mean, Bezos paid in the low hundreds of millions for the
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.180]   Washington Post.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.140]   That's like way more common when you see these type of buyouts.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:35.020]   It's like I bought a newspaper for $150 million.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.420]   But 44 billion is a lot.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.940]   It is a lot for one person to spend.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.940]   So, I am sympathetic to the general heebie-jeebies that give some people like, I mean, I can't
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.900]   quite put my finger on it, but like that's a lot of money for one person to be able to
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.180]   spend to like take control of something.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.620]   It's like a sports franchise times 10.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.660]   That's to me, that seems like the nearest analogy is like rich people buy sports franchises
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.420]   and that's single digit billions.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.420]   So, we'll see.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   We'll see.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.340]   It's one of those articles where if the article works, it should hopefully get very
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.860]   low Twitter engagement.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.020]   It's like ironic.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.500]   If it goes viral on Twitter, it means you failed.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.740]   I still wouldn't be shocked if you guys talk at some point at all.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   I would love it.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   You'll probably get along.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   Oh yeah.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.660]   He's an interesting guy.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.500]   This was something, I mean, look, I don't know a lot about him.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.460]   I just know it's hard to make yourself the richest man in the world.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.980]   It's hard to make rockets 10X cheaper than they'd been throughout the history of rocketry.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.100]   It's hard to create the electric car industry from scratch when no one else can do it.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.420]   So obviously this is a guy who has a certain set of skills that are really unprecedented
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.060]   and really have a big impact.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.700]   He's also just from a personality perspective, an unusual person.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:03.180]   I mean, I do not think he's neurotypical and even putting aside the actual wiring of his
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.300]   brain, he just has lived his entire adult life in weird, rarefied circles of just being
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:13.060]   up to his ears and businesses and God knows what influences he's had his life.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.020]   So he's an unusual person.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.300]   And I do think that distresses a lot of people because no one knows how to claim them.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   He doesn't really exist on the right political spectrum.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   I saw a lot of articles.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.580]   I mean, I get that there's a lot of concerns I get.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.500]   I get the concern of, do we really want to enter an era where individuals can buy out
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   big companies if something is really important?
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.100]   And again, I don't think Twitter is, but just abstractly speaking, if something is
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.220]   really important to the public discourse, we want one person to be able to own it.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   Like I get that there were a lot of pieces though, that were just trying to generally
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.220]   slander Musk.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.540]   Like, well, Musk once said this and Musk once made this reaction.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.940]   And to that, I'm less sympathetic because I'm like, look, this is a guy who is an unusual
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.700]   guy who's not very careful about the way he speaks.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.180]   I think if you try to mine things, he's tweeted.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.180]   He also trolls.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.820]   So I was like, I don't think you're going to get a good indication of how he feels about
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:09.380]   things by looking for the way he's mentioned, mentioned issues, because he's a weird guy
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:16.260]   who, who just spits things off left and right and smokes up on Rogan's podcast.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.260]   So I don't know.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   I like, like, like there'd be dragons.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.820]   Is that Musk hacking into our feed here?
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.820]   Anyways.
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.540]   Yeah, I would, I would talk to him, but I think he has other things to do.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.740]   I said this, like, I don't want to go on to this too long, but there was a, the most interesting
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:38.060]   in my research, the most interesting take I saw came from Walter Isaacson, who's writing
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.760]   right now, the biography of Musk.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   And so based on this tweet, I think he must be following him around right now on the day
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.540]   that the deal was announced.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.940]   Isaacson, Isaacson tweeted.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.580]   I was like, here's what Musk did today.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:57.300]   Like after that deal was announced, he went on to his, his weekly meeting at so-and-so
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.380]   proving grounds on the such and such rocket engine where they spent three hours trying
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.260]   to troubleshoot a problem with one of the valves.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.020]   Twitter wasn't mentioned once.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.540]   This is someone who can multitask.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.180]   And I thought that was kind of interesting, this idea that he came in and it was like,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.920]   maybe not even the most interesting part of his day was, oh, I'm buying Twitter.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.980]   And then he kind of moved on and was working on other things as well that he is probably
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:27.300]   paying less attention to this thing he did than all these other people surrounding it
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   in the media universe who are just talking, talking, talking about it, like is the biggest
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   story.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.060]   It's probably like the third most interesting thing going on in his life right now.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   So it's an interesting character, but I thought that was the most interesting reality.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.220]   I wonder if he's going to work on it a lot because his days are already pretty filled.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.220]   Yeah, that's the other thing.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   That's the other thing.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.280]   He probably, he's busy.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.340]   So I don't know.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.340]   And he works constantly.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.740]   He works constantly.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   It's unclear.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.860]   Because now, of course, he executes like he comes in like look at Space Link.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.320]   You know, he comes in with these ideas and somehow actually gets these companies up and
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   running.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   So who knows?
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.820]   Maybe he will come in, but he could very easily just lose interest.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.140]   I don't think he's replaced, I don't know that he's replacing the CEO or anything.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.140]   So it's unclear.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.540]   According to my research, it's very unclear what's going to happen.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.360]   I'd like to hear you guys talk about reading.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   He reads a lot.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   Yes.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   I like talking.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   We could talk.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   We could nerd out.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   We could talk algorithms for sure.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   I think he would appreciate that.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   It's just a matter of time.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   All right.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.600]   Well, now we have we're feeding the beast because now we've talked about Elon Musk for
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.660]   20 minutes.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:33.360]   So we're feeding the same beast that I'm complaining about, which is like the real issue here is
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.880]   stop obsessing about Musk and Twitter and just stop paying attention to Twitter.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.120]   And then you won't care who owns it.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.640]   You won't care what's going on there.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   All right.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.440]   So obviously, we can't control ourselves either.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   Let's do some questions.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.600]   Let's see what people out there actually care about.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.080]   So we got some good questions to get to some written questions and some calls.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.320]   I also have a habit tune up lurking.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.480]   But first, let me briefly talk about a sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.440]   And that is ExpressVPN.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.800]   If you connect to the Internet from various different places, you need a VPN.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.360]   I've explained it before on the show.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.120]   It is an intermediary between you and the Internet.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.940]   You connect with a secure encrypted connection to a VPN server.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.640]   That server then connects to the Internet on your behalf, keeping your traffic private,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.080]   keeping your identity private.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.780]   So it is the way to connect to the Internet, especially when on the road and when traveling.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.480]   And ExpressVPN is the VPN service I prefer.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.200]   I like it because it's fast, good bandwidth.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.920]   I like it because they have servers in 94 different countries.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.400]   And it works really well with all the different devices you use.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.000]   It's seamless, you turn it on.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.040]   You don't even know you're going to a VPN, but you get all of that protection.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:58.440]   Let me just point out a side benefit of using ExpressVPN is you can choose what VPN server
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.080]   you want to connect to the surf the Internet.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:06.400]   And because they're in 94 countries, you can select a server that is in a different country.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:13.160]   A nice little benefit is that that can get you around regional content controls.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.640]   For example, there was some BBC stories I was interested in, especially when I was tracking
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.440]   the pandemic more closely.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.480]   I would often go to BBC, which is a little bit less politicized in some of the coverage
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.520]   here in the US on some of these issues.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.240]   The BBC iPlayer, however, checks to see if you're coming from the UK.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.520]   So if you're just going to it from your phone here in the US, you're gonna be limited on
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.160]   what you can watch with ExpressVPN.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.760]   Just connect over to a server in the UK.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.040]   BBC thinks you're someone in the UK access.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.340]   So that's a nice little side effect to using a VPN.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.240]   So be smart.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.840]   Stop paying full price for streaming services and only getting access to a fraction of their
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   content.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.800]   Protect your traffic, protect your identity.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.980]   By using a VPN, you can get your money's worth at ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:09.040]   Don't forget to use my link at ExpressVPN.com/deep and you will get an extra three months of
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.680]   ExpressVPN for free.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.800]   Let's also talk about My Body Tutor.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:22.400]   All right, last summer, maybe you weren't at the beach or pool as much, but now the
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.720]   upcoming beach and pool season, you might care about how that body works.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.000]   You might be thinking, what does it look like?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.720]   Do I need to get back in shape?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.200]   Let me tell you how to do that.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:37.220]   My Body Tutor, this is a service founded by my longtime friend, Adam Gilbert.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:42.600]   It is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.060]   which is the lack of consistency.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.660]   They do this by simplifying the process and the practical sustainable behaviors and giving
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.560]   you daily accountability and support it takes to stick to your plan.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.740]   You hear from your online coach every day.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.620]   You report to him or her.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.180]   Here's what I did on our plan.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.180]   Here's what I ate.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.180]   I've used the app.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.180]   It's very easy.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.380]   You can just take pictures of your food and then later go back and annotate it as needed.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.780]   You submit your report.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.780]   You also type in there, here's what I did with my fitness or exercise, and you get feedback
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.780]   every single day.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   Good work.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.780]   What about this?
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.780]   You can ask questions.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   They'll give you feedback.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   It's that accountability.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.500]   You are working one-on-one with a real coach who knows you and has built a plan for you.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.100]   That's what makes this work.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.500]   And because it's virtual, it makes it quite a bit cheaper than let's say having to have
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.060]   a in-person physical trainer or nutritional coach.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.700]   So if you're serious about getting fit, Adam is giving Deep Questions listeners $50 off
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.860]   their first month.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.000]   All you have to do is mention this podcast when you join.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.460]   If you have questions, Adam wants you to call or text.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:49.460]   You can find his personal cell phone number at the top of every page on mybodytutor.com.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.020]   That shows you how much he cares about customer service.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:57.500]   So remember, mention Deep Questions when you sign up, and you will get $50 off.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.060]   Jesse, I think we need to start putting your personal cell phone number at the top of every
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.060]   episode and at the top of every video.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   Sounds good.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   Flashing.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.060]   Nobody's going to call.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.380]   Flashing like on a telethon.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.380]   Call now.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.500]   If you have any complaints on Cal's Takes, call now.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.980]   We've got to show them we care about customer service.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.940]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.700]   Our first question comes from Walker.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.180]   I don't think this is his real name as you'll see when I read the question.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.140]   I suspect it's fake, and you'll see why.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.980]   Here's what Walker, air quotes, has to say.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.860]   "In the context of a deep life, have you any thoughts on how to balance what I think of
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.380]   as my three walking modes?
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:51.580]   There is mode number one, which is walking while listening to a podcast or audio book,
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.740]   mode number two, which is walking while listening to music, and mode number three, which is
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.740]   just walking.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.380]   Alone with your own thoughts.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.820]   I have made daily walking a big and very enjoyable habit in my life, but I am looking to fine
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.820]   tune the process.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.220]   Should I be time blocking each mode separately, perhaps?"
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:13.420]   Now, Walker, what you need to do is what I call block blocking.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.180]   I want you to get a detailed map of your neighborhood.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.260]   We're going to divide all of the road segments block by block.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.780]   And then you're going to label each of these blocks with exactly what you are going to
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.940]   be thinking about or listening to during that block.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.980]   Worry not, I sell a planner for this.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.060]   It's called the Block Block Planner.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.060]   It's a little bit large.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.460]   We're talking about like three feet by two feet.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.700]   So it's a little bit of a pain to bring with you, but it's not a big deal.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:44.020]   What I recommend, and I think this is easy, is that you get one of those rolling media
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.080]   stands that they used to put TVs on to bring in between classrooms.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.080]   Remember that when you were a kid?
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.500]   And then you could just put the Block Block Planner on the rolling media stand.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.240]   You just push the media stand with you as you're going for your walk, and then block
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.140]   by block, you can optimize exactly what you were thinking about.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.700]   So that's the Block Block Planner.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.300]   No, okay, Walker.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.980]   No, you're not time blocking walking.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:14.980]   But I do have a couple notes about what you might do.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:20.860]   So walking can show up in your time block plan if it is something you were scheduling
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   into your workday.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:26.480]   So if you're in your workday, which you are time blocking, then yes, the time in which
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.220]   you were blocking walking will show up because everything during your day, during the work
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.740]   hours will show up on your time block plan.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.820]   So in that sense, yes, it'll show up in your time block plan if it happens during your
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.360]   workday.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.100]   Do you need to plan in advance, like when you're building your plan, what to do during
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.100]   the walking?
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.220]   I would say for the most part, no.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.940]   It is good to have intention as you set out for a walk, but I think it's completely fine
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.180]   to make that decision as you're walking out the door.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.460]   You know, I put aside a half hour to walk midday just to recharge.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.860]   By the way, I think that's a great thing to do.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.460]   Just kind of figure out how you feel.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.260]   Am I going to listen to an audio book?
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.580]   Or am I just going to be with my thoughts for a while?
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.020]   Just make the make the call on the call.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:14.340]   I think it would be it would feel a little bit over planning to figure out well in advance
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.500]   what you will be doing during walks.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.940]   Two exceptions.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:23.220]   If the point of the walk is to make progress on a professional problem.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.620]   So I'm writing this morning and I'm stuck and my plan is to go for a walk to try to
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.620]   get unstuck.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.420]   OK, there you are planning in advance what you were doing with that walk.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.340]   So if it's for solving a problem, sure.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.820]   The other exception is some people have regularly occurring walks that serve a particular purpose.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:48.300]   So for example, a morning walk to get ready for the workday or an end of day walk to help
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:54.140]   just reset and recharge those might you might know what you're doing in those walks because
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.380]   you do the same thing every time.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.140]   My afternoon shutdown walk is just me alone with my own thoughts.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.660]   So I get a little bit of solitude and can transition from work to non work.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.100]   So those are the two occasions where you might have some advance notice of what you're doing
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.620]   in a block.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.300]   I'm planning a walk to solve a problem or this is a regular occurring walk that I use
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.420]   for the set purpose every time.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.220]   Otherwise just figure it out when you get there.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.260]   I am glad, however, that you're walking.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.820]   You know, we missed Jesse the opportunity in April Fool's thing.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:30.740]   I was so busy in April, but like a block block planner video like that was like really serious.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:36.220]   Yeah, like we could hire Rob and film it really good and just have someone walking.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.820]   That's the type of thing we should be spending time on.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.820]   But we missed it.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   That and ACs.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.820]   That and ACs.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.820]   Yeah, this is one.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:47.100]   Yeah, I should be spending about three days a week working on my air conditioner and then
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.660]   two days making parody videos.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.660]   I like it.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.220]   And then I'll leave a half day on Sunday for like computer science and book writing and
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.700]   New York article writing.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.420]   All right, let's move on here.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.100]   Valerie, Valerie has a question.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.660]   Why do you not recommend time blocking for leisure?
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:13.100]   I'm retired and we consider myself to be well on the way to having a good mix of elements
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.700]   in of a deep life.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:22.660]   My quarterly and weekly plan have four quadrants, service, social stuff and self.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:29.580]   I'm convinced that specific planning for the self ensures that it gets included regularly.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:35.180]   Quarterly plans like visit X exhibition get reviewed and entered into my weekly plan.
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.860]   Well, Valerie, I think that's all great.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.940]   But that's different than time blocking your leisure.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.860]   So the thing I don't recommend people do is after their workday is done, have a similarly
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.580]   fine grained detailed time block plan for the time outside of work.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.200]   Is this too exhausting?
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.860]   Your brain needs some freedom to recharge from the rigidity of here's what comes next.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.440]   Here's what comes next.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.740]   One of the reasons why time block plans really significantly increases the amount of work
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.940]   you get done per day is because there's this intensity of this is what I'm working on now
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.780]   and I need to get it done by the end of this block.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.900]   It focuses you.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.900]   And more work gets done.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:12.900]   But that's exhausting.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.620]   So you can't do that all the time.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.300]   So that's why I say don't literally time block your time outside of work.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:23.740]   I think what you're talking about is more like heuristics and rules and metrics, things
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.940]   you do every day.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.460]   You know, maybe I always go for a walk first thing in the morning.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.640]   This is when I exercise every day.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.180]   I have I like to do a reading session on Sunday morning.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.120]   I want to try to hit one exhibition at an art museum per month.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.620]   Those I would call rules or heuristics.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.620]   And those are great.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:47.540]   I mean, as you know, when I talk about the deep life, this is one of my most pragmatic
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:52.180]   suggestions that you identify the buckets of your deep life and you start for each by
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.940]   identifying actually a keystone habit, something you come back to on a regular basis and that
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:01.600]   you track right there in your time block planner or if you're walking your block block planner.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.100]   And so I'm really big on this idea of having rules and heuristics and metrics you track
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.060]   in all elements of your life to the extent that that's helpful.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.700]   It's just that is different than time blocking.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   So I think the issue here is we're expanding the scope of the term time blocking, perhaps
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.600]   to mean systematic organization of any type.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.020]   And I want to keep it very narrow.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.820]   Time blocking is a very specific approach to allocating activity to time.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.620]   It's very intense.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.100]   Only do that during work hours.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:34.180]   But that doesn't mean you don't have structure to other types of things in your life.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.680]   So I think the things you're doing are great.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.500]   Other people should do those type of things as well.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   All right.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.980]   Well, I'm thinking we should take a call.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.020]   We've read a couple of questions.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.020]   Let's take a call.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.420]   Jesse, do we have a listener call queued up here?
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.620]   Yes, we do.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:53.020]   We have a tired father and he's got some phone problems.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.020]   Hey, Cal.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.900]   My name is Diego.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   I'm a graduate student, work at a nonprofit.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:05.380]   I also do some freelancing and I'm recently a new dad.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.660]   My son was born not too long ago.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:16.380]   And I was curious about how you find intentionality in a moment like this when you're so exhausted.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:23.080]   And honestly, I've been going on my phone way more than I was before because the stimulation
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:30.060]   is so helpful sometimes when you're tired and you just need to do something fun or whatnot.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:36.340]   I was just curious what your thoughts are on finding intentionality in a moment where
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.660]   you need to give yourself a lot of grace, but also in a moment where maybe intentionality
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.700]   is more needed than ever.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.700]   Right.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:49.420]   Well, I mean, congratulations on the new kid.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.580]   I think we should not underestimate the difficulty of this.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:58.140]   We often do this in our culture is we don't want to confront the difficulty.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.900]   For example, having a young kid or a new kid at home, we're like, yeah, just kind of figure
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.900]   it out.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.980]   During the pandemic where in the East and West Coast, schools were shut down for these
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.220]   extended amount of times and no one really wanted to confront just how much of a dumpster
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.420]   fire that was that suddenly all these kids were at home and employers were like, let's
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.780]   just let's just not talk about it.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.780]   Right.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.780]   So I do think that is an issue.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.740]   So you're going through a great time, but a hard time.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:28.020]   So what I what I'm going to recommend is that you couple intentionality.
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:34.460]   So a return to intentionality with an increase in simplicity.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.380]   You got to you got to simplify things as much as possible right now.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.380]   You have this new kid.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.980]   So you want to simplify down to the basics.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:45.940]   You want to get work constrained and surrounded with a bigger buffer of time that you can
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.660]   recharge and rest and nap, etc.
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.220]   You want to bring intentionality then into not just how you cut things down, but what
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.180]   you do outside of that time.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:49:00.580]   Don't in this don't in this instance confuse intentionality with increasing quantity of
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.220]   activity, increasing ambition of activity.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.940]   I want you to scale all that back.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.980]   But I don't want you to wander once you be pretty intentional.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:16.100]   So I've cut back on work and I come home and I nap and then just a two hour period where
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.100]   it's just like me and the baby, like very intentionally, it's very important.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.140]   We're tired together, but it's just this time we have together.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:27.100]   I am doing reflection walks every morning because this is a big new part of my life
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.820]   and I need to start to make sense of through solitude and self-reflection what's important
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.820]   to me and what's not and how I need to shift my self-conception given that we have this
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.000]   new child and it changes everything I understand about the world.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.860]   So these type of things you want to inject into your life, this type of intentional activity,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.460]   but coupled with an intentional simplification.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.340]   Where you go easy on yourself and say, I can't do as much work.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.780]   Now is not the time to take on the new project.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.540]   Now is the time I'm going to have to step back from this project.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.980]   Keep things simple.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.740]   Keep work in a more narrow time frame with time off in the middle to nap.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:06.860]   Maybe get a little bit more organized about it so I can keep up with things with it.
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.660]   I can't do frenetic stuff right now.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.140]   I can't stay up late to get something done.
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.340]   So I have to be really organized.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.180]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.180]   Be more intentional and simplify your life at the same time.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:21.540]   That can actually be, by the way, a wonderful combination.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:26.860]   There are periods in your life when there's a challenge, like the challenge of the carrying
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.060]   up a new child, but you've also simplified your life during this time as well.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:36.020]   You're not so work focused and you have these important intentional rituals.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.740]   You and your kid, you go on this walk every day.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.200]   You're doing more thinking and reflecting.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.980]   You have this new bedtime routine.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:47.740]   There's a lot of value that can come out of that, but only if you get intentional.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:52.700]   So do not confuse intentionality again with ambition or quantity.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.020]   It's just about are you in control of what you're doing or not.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.740]   And when you go through this exercise, you're going to find you don't really want to spend
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.940]   a lot of time on your phone.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.940]   You're tired.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:05.620]   You'd much rather be tired sort of laying there on the blanket that you put out in the
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.140]   park with the kid because this is what you do in the afternoons when the weather is nice
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:15.260]   and you kind of play and you kind of rest and that's what you do when the sun is shining
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.980]   and it all feels good.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.060]   And you say, why do I need to look at TikTok?
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.060]   All right.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:28.900]   So I want to go return to a segment we introduced a couple of weeks ago, the habit tune up segment.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:36.100]   The idea here is that I just take a piece of advice from the large toolbox of tips and
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:40.420]   tricks and rules I've written about or talked about over the years and just focus on it
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   a little bit.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:48.220]   And so in particular, today, I want to talk about what I think is the most important piece
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.860]   of productivity software that's out there.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:55.180]   And I'll give you a hint, you all already have it on all of your devices.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.800]   That's the good news.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:04.940]   And that is my strategy of using a working memory dot txt, plain text file.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.180]   So I have a couple of different names for this.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.300]   A working memory dot txt is one name for this.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.220]   The other is what I call text file or plain text file productivity.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.780]   Over the years, I've used both of those terms.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.160]   But the basic idea is quite simple.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:23.460]   You have on the computers you use a blank text file and you keep it open and it's always
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.380]   open on your desktop.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.260]   I call mine working memory dot txt.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.260]   I'm just using the text editor on my Mac.
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.420]   I don't even have rich formatting turned on.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   It's plain text.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.260]   There's no bolding, there's no font sizes, just plain text and you just have it open.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:44.980]   And it is literally a way to offload things out of your brain, where you can still see
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.720]   them, look at them, organize and make sense of them without having to keep all these things
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.920]   in your mind at the same time.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:57.360]   And what this is recognizing, the reality this is recognizing is that we have very limited
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360]   working memory.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.700]   So we can only keep so much in our head at a time.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:06.540]   And as I talk about all the time on this show, there's a real cost of cognitive context switching.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.500]   So if you're trying to keep track of multiple different things at the same time, it's very
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:16.100]   difficult to sort of go back and forth between them, to see how they trade off, to see how
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.340]   you're going to make these things work, because your mind is trying to switch back and forth
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.940]   between all these contexts.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.060]   If you offload things to a text file, you can just see them.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:30.940]   It is a huge cybernetic boost to your organizational capacity.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.260]   So now you can have lots of things written down, you can see them without having to hold
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.180]   them in your head, you can focus on one thing at a time at your head.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.780]   You can also juggle a bunch of things and see their connections, because when you're
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.780]   looking at them all written down and not trying to hold them all in your head, you're not
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.820]   paying nearly as big as a context shifting cost.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:49.300]   It's a huge secret to my success.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.980]   So there's a couple ways you might use this.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.380]   One would be you're trying to solve a complicated problem.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:00.900]   How are we going to get, we have this visitor coming, how are we going to get the travel
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:01.900]   logistics?
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:02.900]   What do we need to do?
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:03.900]   Man, this just seems so complicated.
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:04.900]   Are they going to come?
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.740]   Are they going to need a hotel?
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:07.820]   Where are they going to stay?
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:11.020]   So you have a problem that's complicated, it has a lot of moving parts.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.580]   You're not going to solve this in your head.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:14.820]   You start typing everything out.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.900]   What are all the different things that need to happen?
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.080]   You refine it and you combine it.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.460]   You can start doing visual lexicographic thinking.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.020]   Like, well, let me grab these three lines, copy and paste and put them down here and
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:30.940]   label them with, all right, this I can all offload to, you know, Jesse to do this I don't
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:31.940]   know about this.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:32.940]   I'm going to move to Thursday.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.340]   You can start labeling these things and categorizing them.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.660]   You're doing very complex organization and thinking here that you would not be able to
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.440]   do very well just in your head.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.180]   The text file helps.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.900]   Another scenario where the plain text file is going to really help you is let's say,
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:50.060]   you're trying to get through your email, trying to clear out all this email that's built up.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.220]   I have 50 messages and they're all different.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:58.260]   They're dealing with different issues, all different cognitive context.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.840]   Trying to deal with each of those one by one as so many of us have learned can be devastating
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.500]   because you're switching context again and again, email to email and you burn out like,
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.500]   I can't do this anymore.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:13.100]   And you start hunting for easy to reply to messages because your brain is tired.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.280]   The alternative is using your plain text files.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.260]   You start actually like capturing what's in these emails, what their request is, what
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.380]   you need to do in your text file.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.320]   Just give each of them a different line.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.480]   Now you have 20 or 30 different lines on here.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.340]   You haven't had to solve any of these issues that you've just summarized all the emails
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.300]   with one or two lines on this big text file.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.340]   Now you can start grouping.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.680]   Now you can start organizing.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.260]   Now you can start pulling everything related to one project, copy and pasting and put them
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.260]   next to each other.
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:45.180]   And everything related to this project over here and things you have no idea how to answer
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.180]   over here.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:49.900]   You're making sense of the information without having to dive into it, without having to
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.100]   try to keep track of all the stuff in your head.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.660]   And then you go through and you answer all these emails at once, then switch through
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.820]   and put a calendar notice for answering these somewhere else.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:06.260]   It is really like a organizational superpower once you get really good at using this plain
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.180]   text file to extend and organize what's on your plate.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.020]   It's like taking your brain and making it a much better brain.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.180]   And it's something I swear by.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.620]   I keep the file open all the time.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.620]   Stuff is just on there.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.220]   If I just have a random thought, I'll just write it on there.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.980]   And you know, by the end of the day, I try to look at that.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.220]   Is there anything on here that needs to go back into a system?
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.940]   Was there a thought I dropped that I haven't handled?
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.420]   And I'll look through and kind of process that working memory.txt at the end of the
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.700]   day to see what's left on there.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.820]   But it's always there.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.060]   And it's storing all sorts of information and being used for all sorts of different
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.140]   purposes.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:46.940]   And I cannot overemphasize once you get good at this simple but powerful productivity hack,
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.660]   how much extra capability that it gives you.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.820]   How much extra capability gives you.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.640]   So stop trying to do all this stuff in your head.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.500]   Use a simple text file.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.620]   Can I ask a couple of follow up questions?
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.620]   When did you start this?
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.340]   It's a good question.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:12.180]   So if you search, I wrote about it on my blog back in my MIT days.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:15.340]   Look for if you want to do a Google search, I don't know if you have that up there.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:20.220]   Work like me is plain text productivity, working memory.txt.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:26.260]   I don't know, but it would have been the original post on this would have been 2008, if I had
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:30.540]   to guess 2007.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.100]   Maybe a little bit later.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.140]   Plain text productivity is what I used to call this, I think, or freestyle productivity.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.660]   I also used to call it freestyle productivity.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.300]   So like forget, I don't care how you structure this or format this, just like get stuff on
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.780]   the file and start rocking, rolling with it.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:48.260]   There's a plain text dash productivity.net URL.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.340]   I take full credit.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:56.460]   I say before you go to the website and realize it's actually about like kidnapping children
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.460]   or something.
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.620]   So you were doing this in college or was it after college?
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:02.740]   After college, but definitely or pretty early in grad school.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.580]   And then do you remember how you discovered it?
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.580]   That's a good question.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.580]   2009 freestyle productivity.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:10.580]   2009.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.340]   There we go.
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:17.160]   Probably because there's a whole culture of this in computer science and developers.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.900]   So developers, the people who write computer code.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.260]   So I was exposed to this obviously as a computer science graduate student at MIT.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:29.580]   They are really big on using these text editors like Vim or Emacs because that's where they
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.260]   would write their code and they customize it.
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:36.420]   And they got really big on using these for all parts of their life.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:43.340]   And probably I came across the original, so I'm really just a deep hole.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:47.500]   I'd say Danny, I'm going to get this name wrong.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:54.060]   Danny Lewin maybe, gave this famous talk where he introduced the idea of life hackers.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:59:00.620]   It's like life hacking as a notion was introduced by a gentleman named Danny something.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.540]   And I'm going to look this up because I've got the actual name.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:10.800]   But anyways, it was this famous talk he gave about life hacking and how computer developer
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.760]   types life hack.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:20.380]   And on, I believe Boing Boing, Cory Doctrow, if I'm remembering this right, posted his
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.180]   notes from this talk.
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:29.460]   And it was a pretty, oh, Danny O'Brien, not Danny Lewin, Danny O'Brien at 2005.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:35.820]   So look, I'm looking up, I'm looking up in real time, blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:41.060]   The term life hack was coined in 2004 during the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:46.860]   It's coined by technology journalist, journalist Danny O'Brien to describe the embarrassing
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:52.060]   scripts and shortcuts productive IT professionals use to get their work done.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.380]   And then Merlin Mann ran with that notion.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:59.700]   Okay, so Danny O'Brien was talking about how IT professionals use these macros and
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:06.100]   shortcuts in a text editor, how they would run their whole lives out of these text editors.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.180]   So real early in this notion of digitally enhanced productivity was this idea of life
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:13.140]   hacking, which became to encompass everything.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.620]   But when it was first introduced, it was what IT nerds would do to track their life.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.220]   And they would keep track of everything in their life in these text files.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:26.180]   And so I'm sure that's where I was exposed to it through Merlin Mann and 43 Folders in
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.900]   that 2007, 2008 period.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.060]   So I bet that's how I was exposed to it.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.060]   But that's it.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.820]   It's a whole interesting history, by the way, the whole life hack history.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:41.620]   Do you have a, what about when you're walking around, do you have like a file on your phone?
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.100]   I don't, I don't.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.540]   So it depends on how long the walk is.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.980]   So typically if I have my bag with me, I'll have a notebook in it and I can capture thoughts.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.100]   But yeah, if you're on foot, I mean, this is like a productive meditation, right, is
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.100]   working through ideas just in your head.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:03.380]   You're much worse at it than if you're sitting at a computer with the plain text file.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.820]   But it's a really good exercise because A, it expands your ability to concentrate and
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.340]   focus just that discipline of keeping track of things in your head.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   And B, the walking can unlock things.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.060]   It can unlock creative connections that you don't get sitting down.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.260]   So you almost have two options here.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:21.260]   If you're especially, I'm focusing now on trying to have big ideas or like original
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.700]   ideas, right.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.780]   You can sit at a screen and expand your working memory with a plain text file and try and
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.720]   move ideas around and figure things out.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.700]   Or you can go for a walk.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.780]   You don't have as big of a working memory to work with, but you get the ambulation bonus,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.620]   the ambulation bonus, this idea that walking can unlock other types of connections.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.580]   So it's, it's sort of like two different types of cognition.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:47.820]   But certainly I am kind of committed or I don't know how to plan anymore, especially
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:53.860]   planning, email, trying to figure out, okay, I have to book my travel for something.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.860]   Those type of seemingly mundane tasks actually have with them seven or eight, you know, different
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.620]   things that have to happen that connect and dates that matter.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.780]   I don't know how to do that anymore.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.860]   If I can't have a text file to start moving all this information around.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.860]   Right.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.940]   Part of it too is like, my next question is when you're writing, do you like, and you're
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:15.500]   working on whatever you're working on, do you, and something comes up that's not related,
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.420]   do you write on that a lot?
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   Does that happen a lot?
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.140]   Like, look, I have my computer open, so let me load this up.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.340]   All right.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:29.540]   So on mine now it's called WM2.txt.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.860]   WM2.txt was my working memory text file.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.620]   Turns out when you keep a text file open on your computer for years, like weird stuff
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.620]   happens.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.140]   So at some point, I don't know, I just couldn't access that file anymore.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.980]   So I moved on the WM2.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.500]   And okay, I'm looking at it now.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.500]   The first item is a GU mailbox colon two grade request.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.100]   So there's like two students who are asking for their current grades.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.780]   And I came across that and I know I need to do that.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.460]   And so I'm just noting it there.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.980]   Two, there's another, and this, it loses the hyphen, plain text hyphen.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.460]   The next thing says schedule, schedule new haircut.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.260]   So I was supposed to get my haircut yesterday.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.980]   My stylist got COVID, they're like, I have to reschedule.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.820]   And I was like, I can't do this right now.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.060]   So I just wrote down schedule new haircut.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.060]   And now that's going to sit there and I'll see it.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.060]   I'm not going to forget.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:25.220]   And then I have 330 office hours Zoom, because there was, as I mentioned, I was like, oh,
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.140]   at the last second as I was coming over here, a student asked if they could ask me some
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.580]   questions about an exam on Zoom.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.100]   And I told them we could use the office hours, Zoom room, et cetera.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.740]   Boom, it's just on here.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.400]   And I see this every time I open it.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.100]   So this is just stuff on my mind is no longer on my mind.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:47.500]   And the other thing I'll do is I'll put equal signs, a bunch of equal signs to make divider,
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.620]   horizontal divider lines.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.440]   So if I want to just have a space for just messing around with things, I put a bunch
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.400]   of equal signs and like below it, I'm just messing around with notes.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.020]   And typically at the top of my text file is like things I don't want to forget, tasks
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.620]   to deal with or process.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.700]   And then if I want to think about another thing, I might put another bunch of horizontal
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:09.380]   equal signs and so kind of create these little spaces where I can just mess around with.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.420]   I guess it's one last clarification question.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:15.460]   So like when you're walking around, like doing an errand or something and you don't have
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.900]   like your phone or you don't happen to have a notebook, what do you, I guess you always
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.060]   have like a piece of paper.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.220]   So you just write it on that.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.260]   And if I don't, I just, you know, holding it.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.260]   Got it.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.460]   So then when you do your shutdown at the end of the day, you look at that notebook and
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.460]   then you look at your file.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.180]   So if I'm just thinking about something when I'm walking and I just have it in my head,
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.060]   I'm going to write it down as soon as I get back.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.060]   Got it.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.060]   And that's another great thing.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.780]   It's an incredibly low friction to just drop it into a text file.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.300]   Just whatever, however you want to summarize.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.740]   That's why I used to say freestyle productivity.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   I don't care how you do it.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.100]   Just get it in there.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.800]   You know what you mean.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.940]   Whatever formatting you want to do, just get it in there and it's out of your head.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.900]   So that is the most important piece of productivity software that you already own, but you're not
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.780]   using is your text editor.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.140]   And maybe in the future we'll have like an augmented reality thing where wherever you
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   are, it's like, boom, you pull up this thing.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:12.940]   I can just like drop thoughts into it and then boom, like make it go away.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:17.100]   It's like always kind of there with you with some sort of like AI agent that like help
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.380]   you like a Siri type thing.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.780]   I can see how this goes.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:24.100]   I mean, we could try, this would be difficult, but we could try to have a high price software
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.740]   project product.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.780]   It's actually just a text file.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.780]   In the meantime, I think we had like really good marketing for it.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:34.460]   And it was, there was like a really compelling YouTube video where people are getting on
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.060]   private jets and this and that.
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:40.300]   And it's just like a really slick sound effect when it turns on.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:45.660]   And in the end, people don't realize that it's just the text, the text editor, like
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:55.340]   for only 49.95 a month, you too can unlock your productivity brilliance with WM2, the
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:06:01.420]   most important piece of productivity software, which is true ever invented.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:06.260]   And all it is is like a little script that just opens a notebook.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:14.660]   Oh my, well, that would not be a useful product to try to sell, but let me tell you one that
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.660]   is useful.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.660]   And that is Grammarly.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.900]   So I have a couple more questions I want to get to, but first let's talk about Grammarly
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:25.140]   because they helped make this show possible.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.820]   Grammarly is more than a spelling and grammar checker.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:33.500]   It is an all in one writing tool that allows you to clearly and effectively communicate
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.460]   your ideas.

[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:52.380]   Now Grammarly has some pretty advanced features, especially when you upgrade the Grammarly
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.500]   premium.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.860]   You can now do things like tone adjustments, which will help you have a more confident
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.100]   and polished tone in your writing.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.740]   It can do sentence rewrites.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.420]   It's true I've messed around with this.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.420]   It can be eerie.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.780]   Grammarly premium is like, yes, see this thing you're trying to say here?
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.780]   Say it like this instead.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:17.300]   It makes you seem much more clear and crisp and professional.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.140]   It'll also even give you clarity suggestions.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.420]   I think this is muddled.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.700]   Use this word instead.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.300]   Use this construction instead.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:28.300]   So this is what is really most impressive about Grammarly and its premium product these
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:33.340]   days is that it can go so far towards now helping you actually make your writing better,
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.940]   not just fixing mistakes, but making the writing itself better.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:41.460]   It's like having a copy editor looking over your shoulder and making sure what you write
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.140]   and all the different apps you use and all the different devices you use, making sure
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.000]   what you write sounds good.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.620]   So get through those emails and your work quicker by keeping it concise, confident and
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.460]   effective with Grammarly.

[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.300]   for being my listener.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:13.380]   That's 20% off at G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/deep.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.980]   I also want to talk about our friends at stamps.com.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:24.200]   If you've got a small business, inflation isn't doing you any favors right now.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.120]   It's harder than ever to stay profitable.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.700]   So you have to look for those practical ways to cut cost.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.520]   Stamps.com is a great way to do that.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.560]   If you use stamps.com to mail and ship, you get access to exclusive discounts and great
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.300]   rates on shipping from USPS and UPS, which gives it a makes it an easy way to keep more
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.580]   money in your pocket.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.720]   It also saves you time.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.940]   You print the postage right here at home.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:52.540]   You do not have to wait in line at the post office.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.460]   I like the time saving one.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:59.860]   As Jesse knows, there is a post office right down the street from the HQ.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.900]   Nothing gets crowded.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:07.500]   And every time I walk by and see that crowd, and I think this is excusable, I walk over,
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:14.660]   I pound on the window until everyone turns to look and I go, "stamps.com."
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:19.660]   And then you hear like one person start clapping, and then there's kind of slow and then another
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.760]   person starts slow clapping and then more people join and the clapping gets louder and
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.900]   it gets more enthusiastic and soon people are cheering and I'm doing peace signs.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.900]   And then I walk back to the HQ.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:34.620]   And I'll tell you why they're cheering because they don't want to be waiting in line.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.740]   Stamps.com would not only have saved them that time, but it was going to save them money
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.740]   as well.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.680]   I think this is a no brainer.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:48.420]   So start mailing and shipping with stamps.com and keep more money in your pocket every day.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:53.460]   Sign up with promo code "DEEP" for a special offer that includes a four week trial plus

[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.740]   Again, just go to stamps.com then click on the microphone, the microphone at the top
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.700]   of the page to enter that code "DEEP."
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:13.320]   All right, I'm thinking, I've been talking for a while, Jesse, maybe we should do another
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:19.560]   call and see if we have someone who can ask us a question here.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.080]   We got a call from Dave.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   He's an architect.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.480]   He's also a manager and he's having trouble scheduling deep work because he doesn't have
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.360]   any time block space for it.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360]   Hi, Cale.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.320]   My name is Dave Birlkamp.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.880]   I'm an architect working on an in-house design team for a large hospital system.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.040]   I've had great success adopting many of your principles from "So Good They Can't Ignore
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.280]   You" to "Deep Work" and most recently, "A World Without Email."
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.520]   Your tools have really helped me manage a role with complex responsibilities.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:54.200]   In the past year or so, I found my role evolving away from an individual contributor to more
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.520]   of a design manager.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.680]   While my position does not have me managing a team of direct reports, I ultimately manage
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.980]   projects and oversee consulting teams, requiring much of my time in collaborative meetings
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:12.200]   with larger project teams, providing direction and working through design challenges.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.400]   I've started to wonder whether having days with large blocks of deep work is too lofty
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.140]   of a goal for a manager.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:23.840]   In both reading on the topic as well as talking to other peers in similar manager roles, it
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.000]   seems the common mentality is that a manager is subject to endless meetings and face time
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.240]   with those they're responsible for.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:36.760]   I can only imagine how much more demanding having a team of direct reports would be.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:42.120]   This all seems at odds with the deep work philosophy and my own personal values on work
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120]   and productivity.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.760]   What's your advice for managers trying to incorporate deep work practices with potentially
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.080]   limited deep work time blocks?
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.080]   Thanks, Cal.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.160]   >> David, it's a good question.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.640]   So in A World Without Email, my book, A World Without Email, I go into more detail about
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:08.760]   managers in general and how you deal with issues like focus and distraction when you're
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   dealing with managers.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.480]   So I'm going to summarize four points here, four points about the deep approach to being
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.480]   a manager.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:24.440]   One, I think you're correct to note that a schedule built around long periods of uninterrupted
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:32.200]   concentration is often going to be incompatible with the responsibilities of a manager.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.240]   That's not really what they're asking you to do in a lot of cases.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   It's like we're not asking that you on your own create new value from scratch by adding
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.240]   value to information.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.200]   We're actually asking you to manage other people who are doing this.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:51.100]   So yes, I think that's completely relevant to say long stretches of uninterrupted time
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.400]   might not be reasonable.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.960]   That's fine for a manager.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:02.880]   Two, the key thing you want to do as a manager, as you would any other position, is prevent
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.920]   context switching to the extent possible, which means you want to be one thing at a
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.960]   time, full attention, so you move on to the next.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.720]   Very important as a manager that you're not multitasking.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.800]   I'm trying to work on this person's problem while also answering Slack messages about
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.760]   this and switching over that problem.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.160]   That's a huge cognitive drag.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.640]   You're going to make worst decisions and you're going to get exhausted quicker.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.000]   I actually cite research about this in my book, A World Without Email.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   There's a very relevant study to this discussion where they studied the actual behaviors of
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.480]   managers and they correlated it with the amount of email they were receiving.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.360]   And essentially when managers had more and more email that they were trying to deal with,
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.400]   their activities shifted away from what they called leadership type activities and towards
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.080]   much more small productivity focused activities.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.360]   So if you're bouncing back and forth between a lot of things, your managerial scope goes
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.160]   from clear, big picture thinking and directing and towards just more frenetic, small, let
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.840]   me just get the obligation hot potato and get it out of here.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.440]   Let me solve this question, answer this, move this over here.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   It's a much less effective way of being a manager.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.600]   So you want to do one thing at a time before you move on to the next.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.840]   To make that possible, we get to point three and four.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:27.520]   So point three is you want to avoid a sense of overload.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:32.700]   So if you have more going on, more on your plate, more things that represent an obligation
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:39.280]   to you that you can really easily even imagine making sense of, you are going to find that
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:45.360]   the cognitive stress of having such a crowded plate is going to make it quite difficult
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:52.240]   to really focus on one thing at a time and the resulting overhead of each of these obligations
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.280]   is going to pile up in a way that's going to make it impossible for you to do one thing
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.400]   at a time because there's always the next Zoom meeting, there's always the next email.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.200]   So this is what we've talked about, the overhead spiral.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.520]   We've talked about this before on the show.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   Everything on your plate brings with it some amount of fixed overhead, meetings that have
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.840]   to happen, emails that have to be answered.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.560]   So if you have too many things on your plate as a manager, just that overhead, the checking
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.400]   in, the emails, the meetings will eat up your whole schedule.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.840]   And now it's impossible for you to actually give each thing on your plate, each decision
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.680]   that you need to make, each advising you have to give, each reassignment or helping of an
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680]   employee.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.880]   You can no longer just give these things the attention they deserve one after another because
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.360]   there's so much Zoom, there's so much conference calls, there's so much email, this overhead
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.760]   of what's on your plate becomes too big.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.640]   So you have to keep that smaller.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.520]   I got to keep that list of what's on my plate smaller.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.160]   And it's gonna mean a lot of like, Nope, nope, we're not doing that.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.240]   I'm not doing that.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.440]   We're full right now.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   We're focused.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.760]   Here's what we're working on.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.880]   You have to start protecting how big that list is.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.280]   Don't let people put those things on your plate.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.240]   You say, I can't deal with that right now.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240]   You can bring that to me later.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.440]   Don't put that on my plate.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.360]   It's critical.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.380]   We're actually having the blue space, the blue water, the free space to give things
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.780]   attention one at a time.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:09.000]   The final and fourth point is through automation and process, you can give yourself more breathing
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.440]   room.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.080]   So obligations that may be right now you just deal with as they come up.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.360]   One of your reports just emails you and is like, I need approval of this.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.560]   And you're like, Oh God, okay, that's something I have to do.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.880]   And you have to give approval to this pretty soon.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.160]   And it's sitting there on your plate and is a cognitive weight.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.280]   You can take things like those.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.440]   And if you automate them, this is how this type of work always gets done.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.120]   Here's the here's the process.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.120]   You put things for approval into this drop box.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.920]   Monday after lunch, I go through the drop box and I mark approvals on it.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.240]   Things that are automated, no longer weigh on your mind as an obligation that needs your
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.240]   attention.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.440]   And so you can, in some sense, expand how many things you can have on your plate at
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.980]   a time before you cross that threshold of overload.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.040]   If you take a lot of things from those plates, and you put them into automated systems that
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:04.020]   do not require you to make planning decisions that do not require you at some point to specifically
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:09.600]   put aside time on an ad hoc, individualized basis to get this thing done.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.480]   These automation based processes gives you much more breathing room.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.560]   So the stuff you do that happens automatically, happens every week happens every month.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.800]   Find systems for that, that means you don't have to keep track of it.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.260]   It's not waiting for you to put aside time to proactively put aside time to execute it,
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.840]   you know how that gets done.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.880]   All right, so that can be really important as well.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:36.200]   This is where hacks like office hours play a big role.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.520]   Small questions, don't just let these pile up.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.960]   Here's my office hours every single day, this hour, come by my office, call me, I have a
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.900]   zoom window open, whatever.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.100]   That's where all the small questions go.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.480]   And then that's not piling up on your plate that goes a long way right there as well.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.400]   When building these processes, as I talked about, as you know, Dave in a world without
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.280]   email, minimize the amount of unscheduled messages they require.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.160]   So you want these processes where you can execute commonly occurring work without having
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.200]   there to be ad hoc messages flying back and forth.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.480]   It'll keep you back in your inbox.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   That will help as well.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:14.880]   So if you want to look at the particular story in that book that really gets at these ideas,
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   look at the story.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.800]   I believe this is in chapter one of general George Marshall and how he completely reorganized
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.400]   the war department, the U S war department during world war two, when he took over as
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.040]   the army chief of staff.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.080]   Cause he reorganized the whole thing so he could work on one thing at a time, the stuff
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.240]   that mattered, give it his full attention.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.680]   And you know what?
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.480]   He would end at five o'clock every day.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.700]   He was managing the U S army during world war two and would finish by five every day.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:45.920]   He had a heart troubles, didn't want to have a heart attack.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:46.920]   So that was his hard fix.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:47.920]   Hitler productivity line.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.000]   I don't work past five and he made it happen by using these type of ideas.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.640]   So go back and read that story.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:57.000]   If you a listener out there have not read a world without email, you should, and you'll
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.680]   like that story that's right there in chapter one.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:05.140]   But just to summarize again, Dave, forget long unbroken periods of intense concentration.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:10.880]   That's not your job, but to working on things one at a time with your full attention before
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:14.560]   you move on to the next is how you're going to Excel as a manager to make that possible.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.560]   You have to avoid overload by saying no to things and by automating as many things as
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.560]   you can.
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   They're already on your plate.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.700]   You do all those things.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:29.560]   You can like George Marshall win the proverbial war while getting home by five every day.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.280]   All right, let's see.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.280]   What do we add here?
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.280]   One 20.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.400]   Let's do one more, you know, we're only doing weekly episodes now, so we can, we can fit
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.140]   in one more question.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:45.220]   This final question comes from Domi who asks, where do you put your extended thoughts about
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.220]   your life?
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:50.040]   I know you have a moleskin that you carry with you for capturing the ideas about your
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.320]   life that come to you, but where do you flesh out the thoughts that don't directly apply
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:59.800]   to your semester or annual objectives, such as things in the contemplation bucket?
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.160]   Well there's two places, Domi.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.220]   So one, a lot of things just live in the moleskin.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:10.080]   If it's something I think is important, but it's not being acted on.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.760]   So there's not a plan in place.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.480]   So it doesn't live in my semester plan of like, Hey, we're making progress on this thing
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.480]   now.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.480]   So remember that when you build your weekly plan.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.160]   So you'll remember when you build your daily plan, if it's, if it's important, but I'm
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.680]   not taking action on it yet, I don't quite know what to do with it.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680]   It'll just live in the moleskin.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.440]   And when my moleskin fills, you copy the important ideas from that one to the new one.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.320]   And it's that transference of ideas that are still important that really helps emphasize
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.800]   like what is sticking around, what requires your attention, it helps refresh those things
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   in your mind.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:47.200]   So that's where non acted on big ideas tend to live for me is in the moleskin.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:51.440]   And what about things that are in action that's going to live in those semester plans.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.360]   And we've talked about this before on the show, but I will go way more broad in timescales
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.480]   than just semester on my semester plans.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.100]   Annual objectives will be on there.
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:08.000]   Like the projects I build around the objectives I build around my birthday each year.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.800]   Notes will live on their heuristics, things I want to do like every week or every day,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.680]   new habits that will live on there.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.000]   So I call it the semester plan because for sure, at least once a semester I update it,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.640]   for sure that plan is going to look at the semester ahead and give me my guidelines for
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.640]   what to do with it.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.840]   But it has all this other stuff on it as well.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.880]   I use the semester plan very fluidly.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.140]   So that's where you can have a lot of different ideas and projects.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.420]   The book you're writing over a two year period, that's living in there.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:39.360]   Your reminder, they'll be working on it and what you're trying to accomplish this semester
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.360]   versus next.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.640]   The fact that you're going to wait till next summer to make progress on this, all of that
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.720]   can live in the semester plan.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.000]   I think that's the right place to be.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.640]   So at least for me, again, big ideas that are important, but I don't know what to do
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:55.020]   with live in the Moleskine and I will transfer it from Moleskine to Moleskine as needed.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:59.680]   Big ideas that are being acted on live in that semester plan, even if their timescale
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:06.820]   is broader than just the current semester.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.560]   So again, in the end, for me, what does that mean?
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:15.720]   That means I have a Moleskine, a semester plan, a weekly plan, the daily plan.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:19.680]   That's really the I think that's really everything when it comes to the organizational element
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.760]   of my life.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:26.800]   Then I have extensive notes for books and articles and content based.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.800]   That's a whole other whole other issue.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:35.200]   I use Rome and I use Scrivener and there's a lot of other tools when it comes to just
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.000]   where I keep track of information that's relevant to specific projects.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.320]   But in terms of organization, those four things get me a far away.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:44.600]   Those those four things get me pretty far.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.560]   I think the only one we're leaving out there is the value plan, which is where you have
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.360]   your big picture summary of the things you value and that mutates more slowly.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.520]   The type of things Dami is talking about might eventually migrate to there if you're really
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.640]   changing your list of what you value, what it means.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.000]   So that could change as well.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.320]   So we got Moleskine value plan, semester plan, weekly plan, daily plan.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:09.680]   And those planners have my block block planner on the media stand, have my forty nine ninety
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:16.240]   five a month world breaking productivity software, which is just a link in an email that opens
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.880]   up notebook or working text.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.640]   Those are all the tools you need.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.400]   You simply have those tools.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.960]   I think I think you'll be fine.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.840]   All right, Jesse, it's been almost one thirty.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.840]   It's been a while since we've gone this long, which is good summer.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.680]   Yeah, we've got more energy, but we should probably wrap things up.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.640]   So thank you everyone for listening.
