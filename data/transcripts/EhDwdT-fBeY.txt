[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.080]   the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter, in the thirtieth verse. The thirtieth
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.720]   verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. He must increase, but I must
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.160]   decrease. I take that particular statement out of this paragraph, out of this section,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.240]   because as I am going to try to show you, it sums up what is the essential teaching
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.440]   of this incident. Now those who worship here regularly will remember and realize that what
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.360]   we are doing is to work our way through this great Gospel according to St. John in order
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.920]   that we may concentrate our attention, not so much upon the detailed history, but upon
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.520]   the great theme of the whole of the Gospel, which is that what is offered us in our Lord
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.680]   and Savior Jesus Christ is eternal life. The Gospels each give an account of our Lord,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.320]   but it is generally agreed that they have a kind of leading theme. While the facts are
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.720]   common to them all, in general, it is clear that each was led by the Spirit to emphasize
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.320]   a particular aspect of the life and work and ministry of our blessed Lord. And there can
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.600]   be no doubt whatsoever that this is the great and leading theme in this Gospel according
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.640]   to St. John. Now that is not my opinion. We have John's own statement to that effect.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.760]   He says at the last verse of the twentieth chapter, "These are written, that ye might
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.120]   believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.360]   through his name." And as we have been seeing, he stated it very plainly in the sixteenth
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   verse of the first chapter, where he says, "And of his fullness of all we receive, and
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.960]   grace upon grace." Or grace for grace, it means the same thing. Well now, that is what
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.640]   we are trying to do. Here is this amazing offer. The Son of God came into the world,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.160]   he did all he did, he rose again, he is ascended through the heavens and is seated at the right
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.240]   hand of God in the glory everlasting. And this is what is offered us in him, that we
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.880]   can receive of his fullness. That is what it really means to be a Christian. It isn't
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.360]   just living a good life, that's morality. It isn't merely believing certain things
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   about him, that can be a kind of dead orthodoxy. But this is true Christianity, that we have
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.160]   received life from him. Life which is life indeed, life and life more abundant. This
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.400]   fullness that resides in him. Now this is, as we have been seeing, the real theme of
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.080]   the whole of this Gospel, as it is indeed the theme of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.720]   The picture of the Church as the body of Christ conveys this so perfectly. All comes from
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.200]   the head, the fullness is there, it's the nerve centre, the vital centre, and every
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.520]   part and portion, every individual little item, every little member, all derives its
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   life and being and sustenance from the head. And this, I say, is Christianity. Well, very
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.760]   well, what we are doing is this. We are examining ourselves in the light of this. Is that our
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.400]   idea of being Christian? Is that still more important, the impression that we are giving
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.120]   to others of what Christianity is? We live in a world that is weary and tired, a world
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.640]   that is merely existing. It wouldn't have to multiply its pleasures and be so dependent
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.560]   upon them if it were to have life. People who live on stimulants are confessing that
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.240]   they are lacking in vital energy, and the world today is living on stimulants. It hasn't
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.120]   got life. Here is the greatest need, and here is the only source of life. But I say the
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.400]   great question is, have we who claim to be Christians, have we got this? Have we received
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.320]   something of this fullness, and are we receiving more and more of it? Well, no. What we are
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.640]   doing is this. We are considering some of the hindrances to this. There is obviously
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.400]   something wrong. The Christian church wouldn't be as she is if we were all receiving of this
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.920]   fullness. The church is weak. She is despised. She is dismissed. She is rejected. The world
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.760]   feels that she has got nothing at all, that she is just an anachronism in this modern
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.280]   world. But every time there is a true revival or reformation in the church, things are entirely
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   changed and the world begins to look to the church again. And that is the supreme need
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.400]   at this hour. Well now then, the question is, what is it that is robbing us of this
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.880]   fullness? Why is it that we don't know more about it? Why is it that we are not filled
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.960]   with the spirit of rejoicing and of praise and of thanksgiving, as the early Christians
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.480]   were, and as Christian people always should be? Well, no. There are many, many hindrances
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.200]   and obstacles. The thing itself is plain. But why don't we have it? Well, I say it
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.760]   is because, ultimately, of our adversary the devil, the confusion he causes in various
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.840]   ways. And thank God, we are not ignorant of his devices. The word of God teaches us concerning
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.480]   them. It exposes them to us. It makes them plain. So that, listening to its teachings,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.440]   we should all be able to see the very thing that is hindering us and get rid of it in
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.520]   order that we may receive of this fullness. Well now, we have considered many of these
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.360]   hindrances already, but we come this morning to a new one, to another one, a different
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:22.160]   one. And it is indeed a very common one. And once more, fortunately for us, it is put in
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.960]   the form of what was done by certain people. We have already been looking at the hindrances
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.000]   as they are represented in a man like Nicodemus. There was a man who was full of difficulties,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   problems, hindrances. They had to be overcome. The man wanted the right thing, but he was
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.600]   so wrong in many respects. All these have to be put right. Well, now, here is a different
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:56.320]   picture, but an equally important one. It is represented by the friends and the followers,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.440]   the disciples of John the Baptist, and what they said to John, and what they tried to
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:11.760]   persuade John to do. But, thank God, the teaching that we stand in need of is found in the reaction
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.400]   of John the Baptist to his own followers, and what he said to them so plainly and so
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:23.600]   clearly. What's the problem? Well, if you like, it's the problem of pride. And here
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.280]   is something that is taught universally in the whole of the Bible. The greatest hindrance
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.000]   and obstacle of all, perhaps, is ultimately pride. It takes many forms. Pride of intellect,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.080]   pride of achievement, pride of understanding. However, it doesn't matter so much about
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.600]   the form. It is pride in its essence that constitutes one of the greatest hindrances
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.520]   to our receiving of his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:59.600]   Now, we're all proud, every one of us. There is no person who isn't proud. This is something
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:07.000]   universal, and it's, of course, the result of sin. The original sin was the sin of pride.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.560]   Has God said that you shouldn't eat of that fruit? He said so because he wants to keep
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.720]   you down. He knows that if you eat of it, you yourselves will become as gods, and that
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:26.680]   appealed to the woman and to the man. That's pride. It was the original source of trouble.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:33.160]   You can trace most of the manifestations of sin ultimately back to pride, the desire to
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:39.720]   be great and important, this belief in ourselves. It's in us all as the result of sin. It's
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:46.600]   universal. But as this incident shows us so plainly and so clearly, and we must pay great
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.280]   attention to this, the thing is not only in us all by nature. It is something that is
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.560]   often fed in us and encouraged in us by our friends, by our well-wishers.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:07.080]   Now, here is the most extraordinary thing which is illustrated here so perfectly. And
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.680]   how often has this been seen in the long history of the Church and God's people, in its outstanding
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.320]   leaders as well as in its most ordinary members. There has been nothing that has so frequently
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:28.640]   crippled God's saints and leaders as this very sin of pride. You take your Old Testament
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:36.800]   and you see it there in so many, many instances. David several times was humbled ultimately
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.080]   because of his pride which had lifted him up in a wrong and in a sinful manner. And
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.640]   here it is put before us in this way. Well, no, the picture here is actually this. These
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.520]   disciples of John, you see, they had been helping John and the crowds had been surrounding
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:00.320]   them. John had been a phenomenon. He was a remarkable man. After a period of roughly
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.480]   four hundred years from the days of Malachi, the last of the Old Testament prophets, there
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.520]   had not been the word of God in this particular way. But suddenly it had come to John, the
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.120]   son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. And he had become a great phenomenon and people had
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   crowded out from everywhere, Jerusalem included, in order to see this strange man. And here
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.160]   is his extraordinary message and to submit to his baptism. And John had gathered a number
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.120]   of disciples, helping him and aiding him, and here they were, full of this activity.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:42.720]   But suddenly there comes this other person, Jesus of Nazareth. And after a while it was
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.240]   clear that there were more people attending the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ than
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.520]   were attending the ministry of John. And his followers and disciples become concerned about
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:01.320]   this. They are concerned about his reputation, concerned about his greatness. They want to
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.200]   defend his position and they want him to do something about it. And this, you see, leads
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.960]   them to dislike and to criticize the ministry of our Lord and Saviour. The suggestion that
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.840]   there could be anything beyond what John had is to them intolerable. It is insulting. And
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   they are filled with what they regard as a sense of righteous indignation. Was there anything
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.640]   beyond John's teaching? Who is this other teacher? Shouldn't John stop him? And so on.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.200]   Thus, you see, filled with a sense of pride themselves, they try their utmost to feed
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:46.960]   and to stimulate pride in John the Baptist. And they go to him and they say to him, "Rabbi,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.560]   he that was with thee beyond God and to whom thou bearest witness, behold, the same baptises
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:57.920]   and all men come to him." And they were on the verge of saying the kind of things I have
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.000]   been suggesting to you, when John answered and said, John interrupts them, and John answers
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.920]   them and silences them completely. Now there is the picture. But of course, it's not only
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.960]   true history, but it's a parable. Here, I say, is something that is true of us each
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.320]   and every one. And what a terrible thing it is. You see, this thing that was in these
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:30.280]   men drives them to resent and to resist the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ and all
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:36.520]   that he has to offer. That is the terrible problem by which we are confronted. Now how
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.840]   does this work itself out in us? Well, of course, it's the same thing essentially as
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:50.760]   we have in this record. It works like this. Why haven't we received of this fullness
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.920]   and grace upon grace? Well, the first answer is because we feel we don't need it. We're
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.840]   doing very well as we are. Wasn't John doing well? Preaching, baptizing, attracting the
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:11.320]   crowds. And we have exactly the same feeling. We're all right, we're doing very well.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:19.120]   Now this is, as I have often pointed out, the peculiar danger of religious people. I
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   say religious as this thing from Christian. It is possible to be religious without being
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.080]   Christian. It is possible to be religious within the realm of the Christian church without
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.680]   being Christian. This is the great trouble. We've seen it in the case of Nicodemus in
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   one aspect. We're looking at the same thing from another aspect in these disciples of
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.720]   John the Baptist. Feeling, I say, that all is well. There is no greater hindrance to
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   receiving of his fullness than that. There are those who feel, well, they've understood
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.640]   all the doctrine. They are readers. Most people don't read, but they read, and they know it.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.480]   They've got it all, got it on their fingertips. They can state it all quite simply. They've
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.400]   got it, it's complete. And they rest upon this knowledge, criticize everything else,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.840]   and there they are in a state of incomplete self-satisfaction. There are others who are
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:24.000]   thoroughly satisfied with themselves because of the life they live and the good they do.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.280]   They, like the Pharisees, thank God that they're not as other people are, especially like these
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.840]   publicans. They see people on the streets in London and read about them in the newspapers,
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.720]   and they thank God they're not like that. They're not living in the resorts of vice
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:45.600]   and of evil. They're not stooping to these foul and flagrant sins. They're good people,
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.080]   and they've never done things like that, and they're horrified at them. They wouldn't dream
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.440]   of doing such things. But in addition to that, they're doing good. They rarely are concerned,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.880]   and they're out to help people. Haven't they done this, that, and the other? Well, I needn't
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.840]   waste your time. Our Lord has pictured it once and forever in the person of that Pharisee.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.960]   Goes up to the temple, and he thanks God right to the front, and thanks God that he's not
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.560]   as other people are, extortioners and so on. He fasts twice in the week, he gives a tenth
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.920]   of his goods to feed the poor. What does he need? He needs nothing, and he doesn't ask
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:29.120]   for anything. He's got everything, he's doing everything. Now that's the religious men.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.680]   The religious men, in contradistinction to the Christian, is the Pharisee, in contradistinction
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.800]   to the publican. The religious man doesn't see any need of anything further. Why? He's
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.920]   doing it all. He doesn't even see need of forgiveness. What has he done to need forgiveness?
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.720]   He certainly doesn't need any further addition or any greater fullness. Why, the pity is
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.880]   that everybody isn't as he is. That's the thing that troubles him. Now there, you see,
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.400]   is the position of these disciples of John the Baptist, and this is something that many
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.760]   of us have known so well, especially, I see, those who've been brought up to be religious,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.920]   and have lived a kind of sheltered, shielded life, always in the realm of the Church, and
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.520]   never been out in the world and in the gutters of life. Here it is. What do we need? Surely
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:24.160]   we cannot need anything further. Our lives are all right, look what we're doing. And
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:30.520]   this works itself out also in the realm of experience. There are people who say, "Well,
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.040]   I've had my experience, I took my decision, surely there's nothing more? I am a Christian
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.080]   now, I have been ever since then." And they're always talking about this, it may have happened
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.880]   years ago, but they rest on it, and there they remain. We dealt with it last Sunday,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.280]   so I don't elaborate it again this morning. But it is astonishing, again, to remind ourselves
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:58.440]   how easily one can be relying upon something that has once happened. We've got it all,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.800]   we've had it, we've passed through that. And therefore, we need no more. All we do now
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:09.880]   is to remain there. Sometimes it actually uses the word "abide." There's no possible
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.360]   growth. You've had it all at your regeneration, at your conversion. You've had it all then.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.800]   All you do now is to abide. There's no possibility of growth, in a sense, because you've had
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   it all, you've got it all. Now here, you see, is one of the ways in which this manifests
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.560]   and demonstrates itself. And of course, because of this feeling that we are doing well, and
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:43.880]   of self-satisfaction, we automatically dislike any new emphasis. Anything that comes to us
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   which we've not heard before. What is the trouble with these men? John teaching, this
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.000]   was it. But here's this other teaching, what is this? It's slightly different. There are
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.520]   differences here. They dislike this, this new emphasis. "If this we've got is everything."
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:11.360]   What is this suggestion that there is something else? How easy it would be to elaborate that.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.480]   You will find, as you read the history of the Church, and every great movement of reformation
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:26.680]   and of revival, it has always, all new emphases of the ancient Gospel, have always had to
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:33.920]   face grievous opposition. There's always been an opposition to what they've regarded as
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:42.880]   a novelty, something new. Now this happened, of course, at the time of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:50.320]   You see, the Roman Catholic Church, with its mixture of Aristotelian philosophy and bits
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.120]   of the New Testament, much of the Old Testament, it had elaborated a teaching and a system.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.320]   Thomas Aquinas had elaborated it in his Great Summa, and here was the teaching. And they
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.080]   were teaching and preaching that. They'd lost contact with the New Testament almost
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.760]   entirely. They still used it mechanically, but really they were teaching this dogma,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:16.000]   this body of teaching. Suddenly Martin Luther is illuminated and begins to preach justification
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.360]   by faith, which he has discovered in the Scriptures. And they resented this. They said, "This
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.880]   is some new teaching." And they objected to this new teaching. You see, in other words,
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.200]   the Church can reach a state in which the old teaching becomes a new teaching. And of
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.880]   course, in the 18th century, when Whitefield, under the power of the Spirit, began preaching
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.560]   regeneration and the absolute necessity of the rebirth, here in this very city of London
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.680]   and in other places in the country, he was regarded as an innovator. This was a new doctrine.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:59.800]   Why religion consisted in a bit of morality. That was their idea of religion. The deists
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.960]   and others had excluded the supernatural. It was no longer even personal. It was just
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:11.800]   a matter of duties. A dull and an arid kind of morality. They preached it with a lot of
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.640]   literary flourish and quotations, but that was it. And when George Whitefield begins
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:23.240]   to preach a doctrine of regeneration and rebirth, they said, "What's this new teaching?"
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:30.440]   You see, the old teaching had become something new and strange. And I need not take any of
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.400]   your time in reminding you that we've arrived at that position today. If you want to be
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.000]   odd in the Christian Church today, preach the New Testament Gospel. It's regarded almost
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   as something new and something strange. This is the extraordinary thing that can happen
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.200]   to good religious people in the realm of the Church. They can get so far away that when
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.720]   the true message is presented, it's resented because it seems to be a novelty, something
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.240]   different and something strange. And that, of course, is coupled with something else.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:14.560]   And that is our dislike of being disturbed. We don't like to be disturbed. We all like
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:21.120]   to manage our own lives, don't we? Even our religion. We like to have it under our
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.520]   control. We have an innate, and it's all because of the Fall and because of sin—this
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.200]   is the manifestation of sin in us—that we dislike anything that examines us and disturbs
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:39.840]   us, anything that causes us to face the truth, anything that suggests that we are not as
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:48.200]   we ought to be. Again, I could illustrate that so easily to you in the long history
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.600]   of the Church. And we all surely know something about this by experience. I've often quoted
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.520]   that statement, which puts it so perfectly, that's why I repeat it, of Lord Melvon, Queen
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.360]   Victoria's first Prime Minister, a worldly wise man. He said, "Things are coming to
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.880]   a pretty pass if religion's going to start being personal." You see, religion is something
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.840]   that you bring in on a state occasion, something general and vague, with marvelous pomp and
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.560]   ceremony. But it's not meant to make you feel uncomfortable or to disturb you, or to
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.320]   feel that there's some inadequacy. No, no, this is resentive. And that's why the Pharisees
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:33.000]   hated our Lord. That's the thing that caused these disciples of John to be annoyed and
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.800]   to speak in the way and manner in which they did. My dear friends, let's be honest in
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.200]   the sight of God this morning. Do we resent teaching and preaching that examines us and
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.000]   disturbs us? If we do, we are in the very possession of these people. And that is one
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.200]   of the greatest entrances to receiving of His fullness and grace upon grace. Always
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:03.240]   in the spiritual life there is a sifting, there is an excluding before the great blessing
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.840]   comes in. There is always a going down before you go up. There is always repentance before
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.480]   there is release. But these are the ways in which it shows itself as it did with these
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:21.120]   people. And ultimately, I say, it comes to this. The very idea that there is something
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:29.720]   more that we can have, the very idea that what we are doing is not enough. You know,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.960]   you have your religion in a packet. This is, I think, the greatest curse of the present
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:41.240]   time. Have experience number one, go on to experience number two, now you've got it
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.040]   all. Just maintain that. And as I say, you're no longer open. There's nothing. And if there's
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:53.680]   a suggestion that there's any defect in what you've got, why, this is resentful. No, no,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.800]   evangelical people are not to be disturbed. They've got everything. They look down on
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.120]   others. Is there anything that they need? Is there a lack amongst evangelicals? Is that
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:10.000]   so? Is it possible? You will find that if you present this other aspect of the truth,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.680]   the greatest opposition may well come from evangelical people. Because, you see, they've
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.960]   got this circumscribed idea of religion, this kind of packet religion. It's all so simple
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.440]   and it's all so neat and tidy. There's never any outside possibility. There's never any
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.560]   disturbance. There must never be anything explosive and dynamic. They don't like this.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:37.720]   This seems to be wrong. Well, now let every man examine himself. Because, you see, the
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.440]   outcome of all this kind of feeling is that instead of seeking the fullness, we spend
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:51.960]   our time in defending ourselves and in showing that we don't need anything. We're all right.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   You know, it's possible for us even to resent the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ. It
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:05.600]   is possible for us to resent his offer of this fullness, because it carries the implication
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:12.360]   that we're not complete as we are, and that we need something further.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.160]   Very well then, there is nothing more vital for us to consider than the way in which we
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:28.840]   react to these glorious offers of the blessed gospel. Of his fullness have we received,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:37.160]   that he may be filled with all the fullness of God. Do we know anything about that? Have
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:46.080]   we received it? No. We know, don't we, that the natural man reacts in a wrong way to the
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.480]   preaching of the cross, and especially to the teaching of regeneration. The natural
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.640]   man never objects to the teaching of the ethics and the morality of the Bible. Of course not.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.160]   He believes in that, because he believes he can do it. But what he always does resent
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:09.720]   is the preaching of the cross. The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.440]   The preaching of the cross was a stumbling block to the Jews, and it was foolishness
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.040]   to the Greeks. I read a statement by a man delivered this last week, in which he said
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.000]   the cross appeals always to the natural man. You see, fancy a man saying that in the name
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   of Christianity, the cross appeals to the natural man, because here he says, for someone
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.920]   who was ready to die for the truth. Yes, they'll accept it if it's put like that, but Christ
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.960]   didn't die for the truth. He died for us. He died for sinners. He died in our stead.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.080]   You put it like that, and they'll resent it. They always have done. They resent the
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:52.040]   preaching of the cross. They resent the doctrine of regeneration. Why? Because they both suggest
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.280]   that we are hopeless and that we are helpless. If Christ has had to die for me, well then
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.160]   I must be in a desperate condition. If I must be born again, well then the implication is
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.080]   that I'm so rotten that I cannot be improved. I've really got to be made anew from the very
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.880]   foundation, and the natural man hates that. No, it's offered him by the Son of God. I
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:19.480]   am suggesting that that kind of spirit persists even in the Christian life, and that we are
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.840]   always ready to say we've got it and we've arrived, and we need nothing further. Now
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:31.880]   then, what's the answer to this? There is the trouble, as depicted by the disciples
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   and friends of John the Baptist, wanting to bolster up his pride, wanting to feed his
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:45.200]   self-satisfaction. And oh, my dear friends, you know this in yourself, and you'll find
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.680]   others will say this to you. If you begin to be dissatisfied, and you want to get more
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.200]   and more of his fullness, you'll find your friends, perhaps your relatives, saying to
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.320]   you, "Look here now, be careful. You mustn't take this thing too seriously. Be careful.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.920]   You're going to be fanatical if you're not careful. You're going to go to excesses.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.200]   Why, look what you're doing. Haven't you known something like that?" They say religion's
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.760]   all right in moderation, but be careful. And they think they're helping you, and they're
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.160]   trying, as these men were trying to bolster up John the Baptist, and defending his name
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.360]   and reputation, and praising him. But thank God John the Baptist sees through it all,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.160]   and all you and I need to do is to listen to his teaching. First of all, let's observe
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   his reaction.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:33.560]   John reacts in such a glorious manner. "Here they come and say, 'Rabbi, he that was with
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.160]   thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bearest witness, behold the same baptizer.' Then all men come
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:44.320]   to him. John answered and said, 'A man can receive nothing except it be given him from
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:50.960]   him. You yourselves bear me witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but that I am
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   sent before him. He that hath a bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:02.000]   which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This my
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.480]   joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, I must decrease."
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:15.160]   What's the teaching? Well, you notice John, far from resenting our Lord and his teaching
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:23.440]   and his popularity, rejoices in it. He's open to it. His disciples are disturbed. They dislike
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:29.640]   this, not John. And I'll tell you why in a moment. But let me take this point just for
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:36.520]   a moment because this immediate general reaction is so important. Lest anybody may think that
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:41.280]   I'm just drawing on my imagination, I would assure you that I'm not doing that. I'm drawing
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   on my own experience and I want to support it with others. Have you ever read the story
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:52.680]   of D. L. Moody, Moody the great evangelist? Well, if you have, you've discovered this.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:58.280]   Moody was a converted man. Not only that, Moody had felt a call to enter the ministry.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:04.880]   He'd given up his work as a salesman of boots and shoes and had become a whole-time minister
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:13.680]   in charge of a mission hall in the city of Chicago. And he was getting results. He was
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.840]   doing good work. But the story goes that one afternoon at the end of a service, two ladies
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:27.480]   came up to Moody and said, "Mr. Moody, we are praying for you. We are praying that you
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.920]   may have the fullness of the Holy Spirit, that you may have more power in your ministry."
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:40.640]   And Moody was honest enough to report afterwards that he resented this. He resented it. Two
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.240]   ladies come and say, "We are praying for you. We are praying that you may have the
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.720]   fullness of the Spirit and greater power in your ministry." And he didn't like this.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.480]   Why not? Because he had the same spirit in him as the friends of John the Baptist. Wasn't
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.240]   he a successful missionary? Wasn't he doing well? Were there not people being converted?
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.440]   The idea that he needs to be prayed for. What a terrible thing sin is, that you can even
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.000]   be annoyed when people tell you that they are praying for you. But he saw the implication.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.840]   He saw that these two ladies felt that there was something lacking in him. We never like
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.520]   to be told that, do we? We never like to be told that we are lacking in any respect at
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:28.560]   all. And Moody was man enough to admit he didn't like it. He resented it. He felt like
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.040]   telling them that they had better be praying for other people, that he didn't need it.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.080]   There were other ministers in Chicago who greatly needed their prayers, but not he,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:41.400]   D. L. Moody. However, he came to see how right they were. Now that's the sort of thing
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.720]   I'm talking about. Now let me give you the opposite of that. Let me give you somebody
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:52.840]   who reacted as John the Baptist did. And it's another John, as it happens, John Wesley.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:32:00.080]   Here's the difference. Here again is a good man. Here is a very godly man. Here is a very
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:07.520]   religious man. Here is a man who takes his religion so seriously that he resigns his
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:16.120]   fellowship of his college at Oxford and glittering prospects, gives it all up, and decides to
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:20.320]   cross the Atlantic. And this was over two hundred years ago, and it meant something
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:30.000]   to him. He decided to cross the Atlantic to preach to those poor pagans in Georgia. Well,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   you couldn't wish in many ways for a better man, could you? But you remember the story,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.560]   the storm at sea. And it looked as if they were going to be shipwrecked and all to be
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.240]   drowned. And John Wesley was afraid. He was afraid to die. But he noticed these Moravian
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:50.520]   brethren who were in the same boat, perfectly calm, quite happy. They went on praying, went
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.560]   on singing, exactly as they had been doing when there was calm before the storm. And
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.800]   John Wesley saw at a glance, in a flash, that those Moravians had got something that he
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:07.160]   hadn't got. And far from resenting it, he coveted it, he desired it. That's the right
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:15.280]   reaction. That was the reaction of John the Baptist here. That was John Wesley's reaction,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:20.160]   and it led ultimately to his blessing, which made him the man that he became. And this
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.400]   has been true of all God's saints throughout the centuries.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.520]   So I ask this first question. What is our reaction to a teaching that tells us, "You
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.560]   can be filled with all the fullness of God. You can receive of his fullness, and grace
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:43.720]   added to, piled up upon grace, and it goes on expanding to eternity." Are you in that
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.520]   process? How do you react to that? Does it disturb you? Do you say, "What is this?
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.120]   I thought that as long as I'm a member of a church and attend once on a Sunday, that
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.320]   that's more than sufficient, and I live a good and moral and clean life." What is
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:04.400]   this? How do you react to it? Is there resentment, or is there a longing for it? Well, now then,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:10.560]   let's discover why it was that John the Baptist reacted in this most excellent way,
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:17.920]   and consider why we must also react in the same way if we are to have of this fullness
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:26.800]   increasingly. The first answer, of course, is this. John recognized the Lord. He had
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.000]   borne witness to him. He had taken two of his disciples, you remember. We were told
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.520]   in the first chapter he had pointed to him and said, "Behold the Lamb of God, the taker
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:47.200]   of the way, the sin of the world." John recognized the Lord. I don't want to stay with this
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.120]   this morning. We shall have to go on with this. But he says things like this, "He that
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.560]   cometh from above is above all. He that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.360]   earth. He that cometh from heaven is above all, and what he hath seen and heard that
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.720]   he testifieth, and no man receiveth his testimony. He that hath received his testimony hath said
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:14.120]   to his seal that God is true. For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God. For
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:24.080]   God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him." John recognizes the Lord. He must increase.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   Why? Well, because he is who and what he is. I am only a man. He is the Son of God. I am
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:35.760]   of the earth. Earthly he is from heaven. Son of God. Oh, my dear friends, let me put it
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:43.640]   in just this form this morning. Last Thursday people were in parts of the church celebrating
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:49.120]   the day of the ascension. We must never lose sight of the ascension. Let us remember this
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:55.320]   Sunday morning that we are looking to one who has conquered all enemies. The grave of
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.000]   the last enemy, death. He has conquered the devil and hell, and he has risen. He has passed
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.720]   through the heavens. Look at him. There he is in this glorious power. There is nothing
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.840]   he cannot do for you. Now you have got to start with that. If you think of your Christianity
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.320]   in terms of your little life, you will have nothing. But if you look at him and realize
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:23.400]   who he is and that there is literally no limit, that there are endless possibilities, well,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.440]   then you will begin to receive of the fullness. The Christian church is as she is because
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:33.800]   she has become uncertain about her Lord. Men in Christian pulpits, prominent positions,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:40.440]   denying his deity, denying his miracles, denying his sacrificial atoning death, denying the
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.680]   literal physical resurrection, denying the fact of the ascension which happened visibly
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   and he went up into the heavens and out of sight. There is no hope for such people. If
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.400]   you are not clear about the doctrine concerning the Lord, you will never receive of his fullness.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.760]   It is an utter impossibility. That is basic. That is fundamental. Let us go on to other
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:11.280]   details. The next thing is, of course, that John the Baptist had a true estimate of himself.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:17.200]   John was not ambitious. John did not desire great things for himself. He was a humble
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:25.320]   man. Ambition is always a curse. Ambition is always ugly. Ambition is ugly in the natural
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:31.920]   man. I have always felt that ambition is the ugliest of all the sins. There is nothing
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:39.200]   worse than a proud, ambitious person. But in this realm, it is completely fatal. The
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:46.440]   glory of John the Baptist is humility. He does not want to set himself up in competition.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:54.920]   He knows himself. He knows his own size. He knows what he is. And this is one of the things
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:00.720]   our Lord himself has laid down in the Sermon on the Mount as being the key of entry into
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:10.280]   this fullness. Blessed are the poor in spirit. A man who is not poor in spirit will never
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.640]   receive of this fullness. His jug is already full. You cannot put anything into a jug that
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:21.600]   is already full. It is into an empty jug you can pour the fullness. Blessed are the poor
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:30.360]   in spirit. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:36.000]   Why? Because they know they have not got it. They are aware of their need. Oh, look at
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.120]   this man, John the Baptist. Let us learn a lesson from him. If you are ignorant of this
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:46.520]   fullness, it is probably because of your pride, because of your false estimate of yourself.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:53.320]   What do you know of God? What do you know of the Lord Jesus Christ? What do you know
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:00.160]   of the love of God shed abroad in your heart? What do you know of a power greater than yourself?
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:05.760]   These are the questions. John was aware of his own position and of his own size. And
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.680]   then he says this next thing, which to me is such a great one and such a glorious one.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.440]   It was his first reply to them. John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing except
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:22.400]   it be given him from him." What does that mean? It means this, that we have never anything
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:29.160]   to be proud of because we have always received whatever we have. John says, "You are proud
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.600]   of me and my position, but whoever put me into the position, I did not put myself there,
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:40.160]   I have been put there. It is God who put me there. All I have, I have received. My very
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.400]   position, my baptising and teaching, it has all been given to me. Do not make me proud.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.720]   I have nothing to be proud of. I am but the instrument, the vehicle and the channel."
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.240]   Now this is the most important thing. You see, the Apostle Paul has to say exactly the
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.640]   same thing to the members of the church at Corinth. They were not only proud themselves,
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.400]   but they were taking pride in the various teachers. One said, "I am of Paul." Others
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.960]   said, "I am of Apollos." "I am of Cephas," said the third. "I am of Christ," said
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.120]   the fourth. They were proud of themselves and of their favourite teachers and they were
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.200]   quarrelling over this. And Paul's answer is, "Who maketh thee to differ from another?
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.840]   And what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.520]   glory as if thou hadst not received it?" He says, "These things, brethren, I have in a
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:33.120]   figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for yours sakes, that he might learn in us
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.400]   not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.720]   another. For who maketh he to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:48.920]   not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:55.480]   it?" Now here it is. We have nothing to be proud of at any time. We haven't created
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:02.960]   what we have, we haven't produced it. And the moment you realise that, you cease to
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.600]   be proud and you become humble and you are ready to listen and you are ready to receive.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.440]   The other thing I notice about John is this, that John is interested in the truth, in the
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:20.240]   propagation of the truth, in the coming of the truth. He is not interested in himself.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.720]   John is not worried about how the truth affects him. That is what his disciples were trying
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.560]   to urge him to do. They said, "But look here, you must stop this because it is going
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.200]   to replace you." And that is what we do, I say, when the truth comes to us. "How
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.160]   does it affect me? What is it going to do to me? What is it saying about me?" Forget
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:40.560]   yourself. Look at it objectively as John does. John is only interested in the truth itself
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.320]   and its success and not in its effect upon him or its consequences through him. John
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:54.120]   knows that the Lord has the truth. He is the bridegroom that can handle and deal with and
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.360]   bless the bride. He is only the friend of the bridegroom. He is not the bridegroom.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.880]   And John is concerned about the well-being of the bride, the truth and the fullness of
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:12.480]   the truth, and all that the Lord can do for his people. And that, you see, in the next
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:20.560]   step, leads him, as we are told in the twenty-ninth verse, to be perfectly content with his position.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.320]   He that hath the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.560]   by and hearth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's vice. This my joy therefore
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.200]   is fulfilled. Now in Eastern weddings, you see, up to a certain stage, the friend of
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.440]   the bridegroom was the man in charge, as it were. He held the centre of the stage and
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.400]   he was preparing everything. Suddenly the voice of the bridegroom is heard. John says,
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.600]   "Do you really think that I, as the friend of the bridegroom, ought to resent the coming
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.960]   of the bridegroom? And that I ought to say, 'I am remaining in the centre of the stage.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   Who is he to replace me?' That is what you are saying to me. But you are mad," says
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.240]   John. The business of the friend of the bridegroom is only to prepare. He of all men ought to
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   be rejoicing when he hears the voice of the bridegroom. He stands back. He is the preparer.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:11.200]   He is the forerunner. And the bridegroom comes. That is my position. I rejoice in it.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.920]   You know," says John, "far from resenting his coming. I am very proud of what is happening.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.840]   I cannot imagine a greater honour than to be the friend of the bridegroom." Of course,
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.360]   it is not as exalted as being the bridegroom, but what a wonderful thing to be the friend
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:31.000]   of the bridegroom. What a wonderful thing to have any place at all in his kingdom and
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.200]   in his coming. What a wonderful thing to be even a forerunner who disappears off the scene.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.120]   He must increase, I must decrease. Of course. But what a wonderful thing to have my name
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:49.800]   associated with him. That is the spirit. You see, you cease to be concerned about yourself
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:56.680]   or in particular gifts, or in that you have something more showy or greater than somebody
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.080]   else. Self has gone out of it. People are always talking about themselves and their
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:06.920]   gifts. People had better examine themselves as to whether what they have is psychological
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:13.760]   rather than spiritual. The effect of the spiritual is always to humble us and to make us interested
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:20.040]   in the truth itself and the glory of the Lord, not in what we have. Looking at it from the
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:25.400]   standpoint of self always leads to trouble. The Holy Spirit is sent to glorify the Lord
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:30.880]   Jesus Christ, and he always does. The people who are filled with the Spirit talk more about
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.640]   the Lord Jesus Christ than about themselves or their particular gifts. That was the whole
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.960]   error in Corinth, wasn't it? They were talking about the gifts and comparing them and contrasting
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:47.080]   them, and the place was confusion. The Lord had been forgotten. Now here it is, John the
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:54.520]   Baptist is content to fill any little place. It doesn't matter how small it is. It isn't
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:45:01.280]   he that matters. It is the Lord that matters, and he only desires the fullness that he can
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:07.760]   give that it may enable him to function more throughly and thoroughly in the particular
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:15.840]   place which the Lord has set him in. The less comely parts, says Paul, using the analogy
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.400]   of the body, are as important as the comely parts. It doesn't matter what part you are
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.960]   in the body of Christ as long as you are in it, and as long as you are functioning, and
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:29.160]   as long as that life and nutriment and power is passing through you. That is the thing
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:36.960]   to concentrate on, content with being associated with him. In other words, keeping your eye
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:52.520]   always ever on him and on his glory. He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.560]   Well, there it is. I've only introduced this subject this morning. God willing, we'll go
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.120]   on with it next Sunday morning and the Sunday morning after. Oh, my dear friends, here's
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:11.480]   the key to the whole thing. It's all in this one question, the relative prominence of he
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:22.040]   and I in your life and in mine. God give us grace to be honest with ourselves and open
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:49.440]   in the presence of God. Amen.

[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:39.440]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see him
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   with unclouded vision as he is and be made like unto him in the glory everlasting. Amen.
