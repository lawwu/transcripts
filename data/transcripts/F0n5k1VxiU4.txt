[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.200]   At this time, I'd like to introduce the experts panel for the Q&A with the experts.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.760]   Our first panelist is Director of Personal Finance for Morningstar and Senior Columnist
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.760]   for Morningstar.com.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.240]   She is the author of "30-Minute Money Solutions, a Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances."
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.700]   She is also co-author of "Morningstar's Guide to Mutual Funds, Five-Star Strategies
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.280]   for Success, a National Best Seller."
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.640]   Before pursuing her current role in 2008, she also served as Morningstar's Director
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.960]   of Mutual Fund Analysis.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.640]   She served as editor of several of Morningstar's publications over the years, including "Practical
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.920]   Finance," "Morningstar Mutual Funds," and "Morningstar Mutual Fund Investor."
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.200]   She has worked as an analyst and editor at Morningstar since 1993.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.840]   She holds a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and Russian East European Studies
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.260]   from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.580]   Please welcome Christine Benz.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.680]   Our next panelist is a retired neurologist who helped co-found Efficient Frontier Advisors.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.760]   He's written several titles on finance and economic history, although his early formative
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.280]   training in economics was confined to brief stints in the U.S. Postal Service during Christmas
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   breaks.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.400]   His two finance books, "The Intelligent Asset Allocator" and "Core Pillars of Investing,"
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.480]   as well as the content on his website, efficientfrontier.com, have made him uncomfortably popular among the
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   financial press.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.440]   He's also a big believer in the value of creative non-fiction process.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.480]   During the past seven years, he's written two volumes of economic history, "The Bird
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.600]   of the Plenty" and "A Splendid Exchange."
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.620]   His latest book, "The Investor's Manifesto," has turned out to be another winner.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.160]   He holds both a PhD in chemistry and an MD.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   Please welcome one of the smartest guys I know, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.420]   Our next panelist is, without a doubt, one of the very best contributors to our forum
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.040]   and to the Bogleheads community.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.240]   In recognition of her value to the Bogleheads community, Taylor and I crowned her the Queen
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.880]   of the Bogleheads at Die Hard 6 in D.C. four years ago, so that she could take her rightful
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.320]   place as one of the recognized leaders of the Bogleheads community.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.640]   She joined Rick, Taylor, and I on the book committee on the new Bogleheads Guide to Retirement
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   Planning.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.480]   She's also a forum columnist and shares the writing duties with me for our bi-weekly Bogleheads
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   View column.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.880]   Please welcome our queen, Laura.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:15.440]   Our next panelist is a CEO of Portfolio Solutions, a low-cost investment management firm.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.560]   He earned a B.S. in business administration from the University of Rhode Island and a
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.880]   master's in science and finance from Walsh College.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.360]   He also holds the prestigious Charter Financial Analyst designation.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.440]   He's written five books on low-cost investing, including All About Index Funds and All About
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   Asset Allocation.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.240]   His ETF book is considered by many to be the Bible in the industry.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.200]   He was a member of the book committee on the Bogleheads Guide to Retirement Planning, and
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.320]   his latest book, The Power of Passive Investing, has received wide acclaim.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.660]   And if that's not enough, he's also a Forbes columnist.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.760]   Please welcome Rick Ferry.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.760]   Our next panelist is the founder of WealthLogic, an hourly-based financial planning and investment
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:16.880]   advisory firm that advises clients with portfolios ranging in size from $10,000 to $50 million.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.560]   He's mocked on a fairly regular basis by some financial professionals for his hourly fee
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.480]   business model and its obvious inability to make him rich.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:36.320]   He's also the author of How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street, and he writes the Irrational
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.080]   Investor blog at cbsmoneywatch.com.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.620]   He teaches behavioral finance at the University of Denver and is an adjunct faculty member
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.120]   at Colorado College.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960]   He has a lot of meaningful credentials after his name.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.640]   He's a CFP, a CFA, and an MBA, but claims he can still keep investing simple.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.800]   His goal is never to be confused with Jim Cramer.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.080]   Please welcome Alan Roth.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:12.840]   And as I said, Bill Schultes was scheduled to be with us, but he couldn't make it.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.400]   So we've had several questions from attendees and from the forum.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.080]   So let's get right to it.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   We have a question.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.020]   When I call a question from the attendee, if they would stand up just so that we know
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.480]   who you are and we can respond to you.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.240]   This is from Bob, also known as Shellcroft, Bob Shell.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.360]   Bob asks, "The amount of national debt in several nations, Iceland, Greece, Italy, and
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.840]   Ireland as examples, has become so serious that unpopular austerity measures have been
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.120]   implemented to calm lenders, stabilize and reduce debt, and avoid more financial crisis.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.920]   With so many countries confronting these same and very large debt problems, what in your
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.160]   view are investors in U.S. equity index funds and investors in international equity index
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.840]   funds likely to experience in terms of volatility and returns over the next 10 years?"
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   That's a good question.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   We'll start with, on the end, we'll start with Rick.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   Rick told me to make sure Alan answered all the questions.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   Alan and Christine have to answer all the questions today.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   What does it mean in terms of volatility?
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   Yeah, there's going to be more volatility, but that means that there's also going to
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   be less people investing in equity, so there'll be a higher risk premium paid to the people
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   who hang in there.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.840]   In my opinion, the risk premium on U.S. equity anyway, particularly large cap U.S. equity,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   is going to be higher than what it's been.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   I'm estimating that the equity risk premium is going to be about 6% over the next decade
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   or so, maybe even a little higher than that for large cap U.S. equity.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   Internationally, it might be a little bit lower.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   A lot of money went into emerging markets.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.840]   There might have been too much money going in there.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   Europe's going to take a while to resolve their issues.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   I'm not a market timer, but I can have an opinion just like everybody else.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   In my opinion, the U.S. equity risk premium is going to be good.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   It's going to be a little bit higher than average over the next decade.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   That's my opinion.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   -Ellen, any thoughts?
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   -Does it seem like the market is much more volatile today?
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   I just looked it up.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   Wilshire gave me some great data.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.840]   The monthly standard deviation of the last 10 years is 4.7%.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   The previous 30 years was 4.6%.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   A tiny bit more volatile, perhaps more volatile on a daily basis.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Today, we have sovereign nations that can go under.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   This time, it's different.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   The last time, it was different.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   The next time, it will be different.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   Capitalism will survive.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   -I largely agree with what Rick and Allen said.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   I might make the case that I think that foreign stocks,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   particularly European stocks, are even more attractively priced right now.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   It's not difficult to find continental European stocks
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   selling at single-digit multiples.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   I don't know what the European index fund is,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   but it's probably fairly close to 10 right now.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   Dividend yield fairly close to 4%.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   That's discounted a fair amount of bad news,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   which is pretty much constant with what Rick said.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   I almost think the emerging markets now are almost becoming fairly valued once again.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   When I get asked by professional audiences what I think of emerging markets,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   I say the wonderful thing about them is that from time to time,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   they can become really cheap.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   I think that's about to happen.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   I'll ask Rick one question, though,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   which is that in order to see an equity risk premium of 6%,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   are you expecting more price falls to get there,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   or do you think we're there already?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   In other words, you're predicting that an equity risk premium of 6% or about
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   on U.S. equities, do you think we're there already,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.840]   or do you think the price is going to have to fall to get there?
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   I think we're there.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   I think we're there in the way I calculated.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   This is before inflation, so it's a real equity risk premium,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   and you have to add an inflation rate on top of this.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   Right now we have S&P paying 2.1%, 2.2% dividend.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   If dividends are reinvested, there's actually a compounding effect that takes
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   place over a 10-year period of time.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   So, in fact, dividend yield over a 10-year period of time would be more like 2.5.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   So there's 2.5 from dividend payments.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   GDP, real GDP, is basically the growth of earnings in a very simplified way.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   So let's say that real GDP is below normal GDP in this new normal phase that
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   we have, and so add 2.5% for GDP growth over a 10-year period.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   That gets you to 5.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   Unlike Jack, I think that the market is discounted quite a bit based on the
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   risk-off trade that a lot of investors are doing, and I think the P/E multiple of
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   the market is actually going to expand as opposed to contract.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.840]   So instead of taking off one like Jack did, I'm actually adding one, saying that
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   the P/E of the market is going to go from 12 to perhaps 15, which would be a
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   normal P/E over a long-term period of time, about 15 or 16.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   And if we get that multiple expansion on equities up to 15 or 16 over the next
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   10 years, you add another 1%.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   So it is 2.5% from dividends, 2.5% from GDP growth, 1% from multiple expansion
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.840]   up to a normal 15 or 16, and then you add on whatever inflation is.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   So 2% inflation.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   So that's 6% there, and you add on 2% for inflation to get to 8.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   - I don't know about the new normal, because the new normal was appraised
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   as a coin by the geniuses at PIMCO in April or May of 2009.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   So that's a great call if there ever was one.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   And low economic growth means low share dilution.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   It means high buybacks.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   And so it's not necessarily a bad thing for the owners of the common shares.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   - One point I would make, I was out at Vanguard yesterday afternoon before
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   everyone else got there and sitting down with some people in their portfolio
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   construction group, the folks who do research on issues such as asset
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   allocation and so forth, and they've got a really compelling paper where they've
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   looked at the connection between economic growth and market performance
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   and found almost no correlation.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   So I think that that's a good message for anyone who's looking at compelling
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   growth in emerging markets, weak growth in developed markets, and attempting
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   to make portfolio decisions based on that.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   What they found is that there really isn't a lot of connection.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   So I know that it's tempting to pay attention to the headlines,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   certainly keep an eye on economic news just for our own lives.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   But just in terms of predicting market performance, it's maybe not something
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   that you want to use to adjust your portfolio.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   - Okay. The next question is from Lady Geek.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:12.840]   She will preface it with the comment that this thread, this subject has over
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.840]   31,000 views in a six-week period and contains one of the most intensely
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   argued topics I've seen in quite a walk.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   And we'll continue this discussion with the panel, and the answer is yes.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   So she said, "With regard to a forum discussion on Trinity study authors update
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.840]   their results in which Bill Bernstein contributed a few comments.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   The first question is, does anyone on the panel recommend changing their target
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.840]   safe withdrawal rate different than the recommended 4%?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   For example, should one plan to vary their withdrawal rates as necessary?"
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.840]   I'll comment on that first, and I'm sure everybody will have something to say.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.840]   But I think it's ridiculous to think that at some point in time, when we retire
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   at 65, that we are going to set a number that can't be changed.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   I mean, we've adapted all of our life and adjusted all of our life to situations,
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   and to think that we are never going to make any adjustments once we set this
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   4% withdrawal rate adjusted for inflation is--to me, it's ridiculous.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   - Mel, I'll just respond.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   I agree with you.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   In general, although I recently had--probably a year ago, I talked to
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   Harold Deminsky.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   Some of you may know him.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   He's a noted financial planner.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   And I discussed this question of perhaps adjusting withdrawal rates to reflect
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   market action, so bringing withdrawal rates down at certain points in time.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   And he said, from a practitioner's standpoint, he said, "Unfortunately,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   sometimes when you're asking retirees to do that, you're asking them to cut out
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   the things that are their real quality of life items."
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   So going out to dinner, going to the movies.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   And so he said, "It makes all the sense in the world if you have it on paper,
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   but from a practitioner's standpoint, it can be very difficult to tell people
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   to cut back on certain things that are really contributing to their quality of
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   life in their later years."
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   - Do you want to comment?
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   Did you comment on that before?
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.840]   - Yeah.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   I mean, I really don't think that I'd change my view.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   You know, to me, the guidelines, 2%--what we like to tell people is that,
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:38.840]   you know, 2% is bulletproof, 3% is probably safe, 4% is starting to take chances,
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   and 5%, you're eating Alpo.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   And I really, you know, I think that the value of that sort of paradigm is simply
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   a reality check for people in the saving phase to let them know that, you know,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.840]   you've only saved, you know, five times or ten times your annual living expenses.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   You're nowhere near done with the job.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   - About two years ago, I did a Monte Carlo simulation for an article I did for
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.840]   Money Magazine, and I felt really good about the simulation because I ran the
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   results by Bill Bernstein, who agreed.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   You may not remember.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   But the 4%, I believe, is a theoretical safe withdrawal rate.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   It assumes a portfolio, in my model, of a 50/50 low-cost index fund with annual
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   rebalancing.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   What I also did is I looked at what would the safe return for the average investor
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   who pays the penalty for expenses and pays the 1.5% penalty for emotions.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   Gold, you know, going into whatever is hot.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   And what I found was that the safe withdrawal rate for the average investor
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   paying average expenses and having average emotions is only about 2.5%.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.840]   - Wow.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.840]   - I always like to look at a safe withdrawal rate as whatever the cash flow
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   is that's coming off of your portfolio.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   So if stocks are paying a little over 2% bonds with a combination of total bond
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   market and some high yield, you can actually bump it up to over 4%, so 2.5 and 4.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   So I look right now at the safe withdrawal rate of about 3.5.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.840]   I mean, it would be 4, except that the Fed is kind of getting in the way of this
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   because they're artificially lowering treasury bond rates, which are part of the
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   aggregate bond market.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   So you're getting less from the aggregate bond market than you really should be
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   as far as the yield.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   So right now, my "safe withdrawal rate," and I agree with Alan, it is a theoretical
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   number.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   I mean, I don't think you should be looking at this as, "Is this the only amount of
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.840]   money you should be taking out of your portfolio?"
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   Because I'm also under the belief that you're not going to live forever.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.840]   Do you want your kids to inherit every dime of principal you currently have now
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   on an inflation-adjusted basis, or they get what's left?
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   And you really have to take those things into consideration to determine your
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   longevity and how much you want to leave to the kids when you die.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   And the fact is, and I've been saying this for a long time, you don't spend as much
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   money when you're 90 years old as you do when you're 65 on an annual basis.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   So you have this flattening spending curve that happens, and it's actually what
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   I've seen with my grandparents and my parents is a decreasing spending later on
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   in life as you get up into your 80s because you don't take as many vacations,
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   you don't have two cars, you might sell the vacation home.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   And all these things happen later on in life where your cash flow going out just
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   gets down to your basic living expenses, and that's it.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   So you put all these things together in a formula, and the question is,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   what is your safe withdrawal rate starting at age 65?
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   It might be higher than 3.5%.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   I always say spend a little more when you're 65 because you're not going to be
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.840]   able to spend it when you're 95.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   And that's my view on this picture.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   So I like the Trinity study.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.840]   I've seen so many financial planners that look at that and say,
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   "You need to cut out your magazine subscriptions because you're not going to
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   have enough money to live on when you're, you know, 113 years old."
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   [Laughter]
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   I just don't buy it.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   So I think it's like much more to that than just that mathematical number.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   Well, a couple of things I'd like to point out.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   First of all, the Trinity study shows what worked in the past.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   There's no guarantee that that's going to work in the future.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   The second thing is is that the Trinity study survival rates use a lot more
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.840]   equities in their portfolios than some retirees want to hold.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   So the other thing to address the point that Rick talked about was it mentioned
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.840]   you don't spend as much when you're older as you do in the early years of
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   retirement.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   But I would say that I would disagree that some people are going to have to
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   spend a lot more because they're going to go in long-term care or assisted
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   living, and that is very, very expensive.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   And I can tell you my father, who is 96, is spending an awful lot of money in
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   assisted living.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   So that's something to keep in mind.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840]   But he has you, Mel.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   [Laughter]
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   I'm all serious about this.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   The one piece of equity that a lot of people who have children never take into
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.840]   consideration is the fact that they have children.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   And their children have done very well, and their children are not going to let
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   them eat dog food.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   I mean, whether you like it or not, the backup for America is the next
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   generation, the children who are going to help support the parents if they
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   need it.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   And I know it's never counted in all these formulas, but it exists.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   You're not going to let your father get thrown out into the street.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   You can --
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:02.840]   [Laughter]
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   I'd just like to comment also.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   I think that something like the Trinity Study is useful for people who are not
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.840]   yet retired also.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   It's just a planning tool, sort of a target to think about.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   None of us know what the future is going to bring, but if you're trying to
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   figure out as you approach that date, when can I retire, you've got to have
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   something to sort of give you a feel for that.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   Part of that is sort of whatever your current expense is, sort of being able to
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   project ahead.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.840]   But the farther out you are, the rougher that number is going to be.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   And I think it's a very good way to do that.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   So if you can aim when you're in your 20s and 30s to try and hit a 2% rate to
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   cover your living expenses, I think that you're going to be in much better
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   shape than if you're planning for 7% or 8% or whatever it is.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   So I just find it useful as a tool.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   It depends, again, like many things in finance, where you are, what stage in
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.840]   life you are, and where you are in this withdrawal process.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   We're still contributing.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   I just want to add to that briefly on what Mel said about the study, about the
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   Trinity study, which is that it's used historical returns with an abnormally
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.840]   high equity risk premium, a sort we're not going to see for a long time.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   And so they recognize that.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.840]   I know Wade Fowley, he did the study on my suggestion in a number of different
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   countries, including Japan, obviously.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   In most other countries it comes out much more friendly.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   But there's another aspect to that study which very few people comment on, and
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   it's always useful to keep in mind, which is that almost between about 75%
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   equity and 25% equity, in other words, between 25-75 and 75-25, the survival
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   rates were almost the same.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   So what that says is that almost really within reason your equity exposure
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   doesn't matter that much to your survival probability.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   What matters is that you keep your discipline.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   And one thing that I see from a lot of clients coming in, mistakes that
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   they've made, is chasing income.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   I'll have people that come in with portfolios yielding 6%, 7%, 8%, and I
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   look at the total return, and it has been quite negative.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   So looking at your total return versus income is important.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   Don't buy Greek bonds and assume you can have a 65% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   [Laughter]
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.840]   The second part of the question is, "Which is the better approach for
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   analysis, Monte Carlo or historical data?"
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   None of the above.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.840]   You have to look at historical data to try to come up with what your
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   expectations of returns are in the markets.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   And I don't mean just doing a naive look back and say, "Well, the return
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   of the equities have been this, the return of bonds have been that.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   Therefore, that's what it's going to be going forward."
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   And unfortunately, a lot of people who are in this business, that's what
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   they do, and of course they have terrible, erroneous expectations of return.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   I agree with Laura.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   I mean, it's more than that.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.840]   It's more--it's neither.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   It's neither Monte Carlo, and it's neither historical numbers.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   I mean, it's more common sense, or I don't know what you want to call it,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   but it's not--there's no hard and fast way.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   I'm a strong believer in Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   And in 2008, Monte Carlo simulation got bashed.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   And it wasn't the Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   It was the incredible assumptions that went into it.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   I saw advisors using, "Well, the stock market's going to yield this.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   I'm more brilliant.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   I'm going to add 2% alpha.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   I'll know when to get out.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   Let's make the standard deviation of the stock market, you know, 8%."
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   So you put garbage in a good model, and you're going to get garbage out.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   You have to use history to come up with the assumptions.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   You have to use common sense coming in with the Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   Using history alone, you know, there's been a lot of criticism that I think
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   is just on Jeremy Siegel's 200 years of history.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   We really only have, since 1926, really good reliable data on the stock market.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:22.840]   So Monte Carlo simulation with real assumptions and common sense.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:31.840]   And the final part of the question, "Is the life cycle finance approach anything new?"
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.840]   That sounds like a financial planner question to me.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   I'm not sure what the question really is, so hopefully Rick or--
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840]   Susan, what did you mean?
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.840]   I meant as part of that Trinity thread, they were throwing up different approaches
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   that come up with the number.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.840]   And somebody at the end threw in life cycle finance as a Monte Carlo historical,
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   and then it got discussed rather thoroughly.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   I thought it was part of the problem to come up with the safe withdrawal rate.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   But maybe they were going a little bit off.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:08.840]   Maybe it was a subtle discussion on something else inside that thread.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.840]   That's so easy I'm going to let Rick answer.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.840]   [laughter]
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   I'm really not sure what--
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.840]   Alan, you're the new guy in the panel.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   [laughter]
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   Christine, too.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   [laughter]
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   Let Mikey do it, Alan.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   [laughter]
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   All right, the next question is from Ken Barrett.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.840]   Did anybody want to address that, or did they understand what the question is?
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   Just discard it then.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   Maybe it wasn't--
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.840]   Okay.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.840]   From Ken Bennett.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   It says, "The question is a general question for the panel.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   "Currently I'm 10 years away from retirement
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   "and hold approximately three months of salary in an emergency fund.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.840]   "What is the recommended time frame for increasing the amount of cash in reserves,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:00.840]   "and how much should I plan on having in that account in retirement?"
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.840]   So in other words, I think the question is, is that while he's working,
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   he has a three-month emergency supply.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   Now he needs a cash reserve to live on.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   When should he start increasing the account
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   so that in retirement he has what would be considered sufficient funds in cash?
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   Tomorrow, three months of living expenses would scale the job result,
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   unless you have really, really, really, really good disability insurance.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   That's what I was thinking too, Bill.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   One thing I've been talking about,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.840]   those yields on CDs and money markets and everything else
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   are just about as low as they're going to go.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.840]   I've been talking about the idea of building a two-part emergency fund,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   so one three-month chunk that consists of true cash
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   and then maybe another portion that consists of a short-term bond fund
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   with some potential for principal fluctuation,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   but you have that truly cash piece for immediate needs.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   So my thought is for most people,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   they want to nudge that emergency fund out a little bit.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   They can do that as long as they do have a piece carved in cash.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   And then in terms of enlarging that,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   I usually say that retirees should come into retirement
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   with about two years' worth of living expenses in true cash.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   I'm sure some others on the panel feel differently,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.840]   and my bias would be to sort of gradually enlarge that
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   rather than doing that just as you are approaching retirement.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   Yeah, I was actually going to say exactly the same thing.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   I think now is the time to start with that on a gradual basis
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   because if you're ten years out,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   then you've got plenty of time to sort of slowly build up that cash balance.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   But I also agree that three months would make me extremely nervous.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   I mean, unless you've got really, really, really solid employment
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   and disability insurance, and perhaps your portfolio is already large enough
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.840]   that if you suddenly had to stop working tomorrow,
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   it wouldn't be a big problem for you financially.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   I don't think I have one month's worth of cash in my portfolio.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   With that said, I have what I call near cash,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   and I've written about an Ally Bank CD that's yielded--
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   it's a five-year CD, but it's yielding about 2% now,
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   and it has a 60-day early withdrawal penalty.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   So in other words, after 60 days,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   I've earned at least as much as the 0.03% that the prime money market is paying.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   So having near cash or access to cash via a home equity line of credit
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   that the bank cannot cancel--
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   so having access to cash is more important than cash itself.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   Yeah, these are all good points.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   I agree with Christine that in my own situation where I'm 53
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   and I'm going to be working for another 10 years at least,
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   I have one year's worth of liquid assets set aside in a separate account,
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   but it's divided into two buckets.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   I have near-term liquid asset cash,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   which is actually just sitting in a money market,
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   three months' supply of that,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   but I have nine months' supply of what corporate America calls
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   permanent liquid assets,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   which the liquid assets sometimes come down a little bit,
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   so I might end up with two months or something like that,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   but then I refund it and it goes back up to three.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   So there's different levels of money that you have in your emergency fund
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   where once you get past three months
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   and you've got these other nine months there,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   these permanent liquid assets you can be more aggressive with.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   I have corporate bond funds in there.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   I even have some equity funds in there and index funds, equity.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   I know that sounds strange to have equity in an emergency fund,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   but that's way down here at the bottom
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.840]   on my one year's worth of permanent liquid assets,
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   so I've never had to touch it,
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   and it's going to be a higher rate of return with better taxes
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   because these are taxable accounts.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   Now, my plan is, personally, when I retire,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   whenever that is, at age 65 or whenever,
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   I'm going to have, as Christine suggested,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   two years of liquid money in this account,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   so I'm going to increase it.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   I may not have to increase it that much
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   because probably my expenses might go down when I retire,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   but that's my plan, so I agree with Christine.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   Yeah, I mean, when you consider a liquid asset,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   I just have a nice range of opinions,
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   and I think it's a wonderful, wonderful exposition of it.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.840]   Certainly I don't mean money markets
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   or money stuffed in the mattress.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   I would define cash as anything
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   that at the end of the financial world
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   you're not going to take more than a couple percent of your head on.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   I wouldn't put corporate bonds in there.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   I'm not putting short munis in there.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   I would certainly put CDs in there as well.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   So, you know, I certainly don't mean you have to have that much,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.840]   you know, a year or two's worth of cash in a money market.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.840]   Well, one of the things that I've long advocated
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   as an emergency fund are I-bonds.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.840]   I-bonds, of course, once they get to the one-year spot,
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   they're like cash,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   and yet if you don't need them,
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   you're earning a very reasonable return,
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   especially if you bought back when I told you about it.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   (laughter)
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   Those puppies are yielding over 8% right now
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   for those who didn't get them.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   But the point is, is that there's so much flexibility
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   once you get to the one-year spot
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.840]   that you can redeem them at any point,
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   and yet you're not suffering with low yields,
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   and you're not--if you're looking for the long haul,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.840]   you're not getting ravaged by inflation.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   Yeah, Mel, it's funny.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   I've been working on a thread with some of our users
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   on Morningstar.com and one of the retirement forums,
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   and I asked them what their biggest surprises
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   were in retirement, happy and otherwise,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   financial and otherwise,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   and a few posters said, "Thank God for those I-bonds,"
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   and I think they actually took the hat to you guys for it.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   (applause)
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   And don't forget, Mel's unloaded.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   Mid-cap seat.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.840]   (laughter)
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.840]   Okay, the next question,
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   "Should TIPS be part of the portfolio of a younger person,
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   "say under 40?
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   "If so, how much of one's bonds should be in TIPS?"
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   I'm sure there's a lot of different opinions on this,
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   but basically, when you're working,
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   normally your wage increases are going to help
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   keep you up with inflation.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.840]   So I don't think it's that important for a younger person,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   but it's still a good investment,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   and there's nothing to keep a young person from getting that.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.840]   My bond portfolio is fixed.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.840]   I mean, it doesn't matter if it's somebody who's in their 60s
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   or somebody who's in their 20s.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.840]   It's simply 60% Vanguard aggregate bond market,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.840]   total bond market.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   What's missing out of the Barclays capital aggregate bond market
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   are two asset classes.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.840]   One of them are TIPS.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.840]   TIPS are not included in that.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   So if you wanted to have a total bond market,
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   you would have to add TIPS.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   The other side that's not included in that index
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   is high-yield corporate bonds.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.840]   So if you wanted to have a total bond market index,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   you'd have to actually include some high yield.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.840]   I put 20% in TIPS, 20% in high yield, 60% in the total bond market.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   It seems to work so that somebody who's young,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.840]   even though they might only have 20% fixed income in their portfolio
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.840]   because they have a lot of human capital in front of them
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840]   and many years to work,
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   whatever that bond portion is, if it makes sense--
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.840]   because sometimes it doesn't make sense
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   because they don't have a lot of money to invest--
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   but if it makes sense, I think a 20/20/60 strategy has worked very well.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   It gives you a little bit of a hedge against unanticipated inflation.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   Inflation rate is inherent in all fixed income, including TIPS.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   What TIPS gives you a hedge against is a jump in the unanticipated inflation,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   an actual jump in inflation that nobody was expecting.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   I think we were talking about between 2% and 2.5% expected inflation over the long term.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.840]   So if it jumps to 5%, it jumps to 6%, it jumps to 7%,
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.840]   that's what your TIPS are going to give you, that hedge.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.840]   So I think it's important to have some in a portfolio.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   I think this was addressed last night at Vanguard, too,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   when they were discussing the makeup of the Target Retirement Funds
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   and why they did not include TIPS in the funds for the long-term funds
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   and that they did include them in the shorter-term funds.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   Yeah, I often look at the data that Ibbotson puts together on asset allocation,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.840]   and Ibbotson is under the Morningstar umbrella, so I'm able to harness what they do.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.840]   I believe that their TIPS allocations for retirement portfolios
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   actually run as high as 30% of the fixed income portfolio,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.840]   and for younger investors it's more in the range of 20% of the fixed income portfolio.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.840]   So it sounds like we're all kind of in the same general ballpark.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   I use behavioral finance as a reason to be a little bit active on TIPS,
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   and I think that as humans we tend to think in nominal terms
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   rather than in real terms, inflation adjusted, that matters.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   In 2008, when the financial system was doomed,
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   TIPS should have been the safest investment out there,
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.840]   and as Bill mentioned, they plummeted.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   Yields were up to 3.5%, 4%. Boy, would I love to go back.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   We did.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   A lot of the boy would instead because that was pointed out.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   And I did as well. But TIPS are yielding--
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   I don't completely agree with you, Bill, on TIPS funds.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   The Vanguard TIPS fund is now yielding CPI minus about 0.3%,
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   so I've been taking some out of TIPS, which I believe in, and moving into CDs.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   Yeah, I mean, again, the question was addressed to the younger saver.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   As I said with Jack earlier, I think that for the retired person,
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.840]   TIPS are wonderful because it allows them to be certain of their consumption ability
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   5 years, 10 years, 15, 20 years, hence.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   But I really got religion in '08, '09 about TIPS,
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.840]   and it made me think more clearly about portfolio construction.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   For the young investor who is stock-heavy, there are really only two asset classes.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   You've heard me say many times before, there's risky assets and there are riskless assets.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.840]   And the riskless assets are there to help you sleep at night.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   They're there so that you can buy stocks when they're cheap.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   They're there so you can pay your living expenses when you lose your job.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   And they're there for when your annoying neighbor with the corner lot
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   you've had your eye on for the past 10 years suddenly needs liquidity.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   And you can be a nice guy and give it to them.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.840]   And TIPS are neither fish nor fowl.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   They're not going to help you when you really, really, really need them.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   And I think for the younger investor, I think that a huge 1% in your bond portfolio is fine.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   I think 0% is fine.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.840]   Well, I think one thing that amazes me--Alan just touched on it--
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   that the TIPS and the TIPS funds are showing negative returns.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   But that's negative real returns.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:04.840]   So people will sell TIPS and go buy a 1, 1.5% CD,
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   which in reality has a negative return of 1.5%.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   So you need to think in terms of real return
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:21.840]   as opposed to just looking at the posted real return that's on Vanguard
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   and think that if you get more than -0.58 that you're actually doing good.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.840]   But people are looking at the nominal return and ignoring what the real return is.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   So what you really have to do is make sure that you try to convert the nominal into real
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   and then compare apples to apples.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   The next question is from Willella. Am I pronouncing that correctly?
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   She says, "I sit on the board that oversees my employer's pension plan.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   The plan's expected ROI over 10 years is 8%.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   I think this is too high, but the plan advisers don't.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   What does the panel think?
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:15.840]   Are there any references or sources I can cite to make my case to the board?"
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.840]   I think you need to check that you're a board member who stole their medications
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   and to ask what they've been smoking.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   If you have a typical 60/40 portfolio, the return of your bond,
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.840]   the real or the nominal expected return of your bond portfolio is 2% or 3%.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   And so to get to 8%, you have to assume an equity return of, I don't know, in the low teens.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.840]   Good luck with that.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   Yeah, but all of the government pension funds are 8%, so why shouldn't I be?
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   That's all I'm using as a benchmark.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   I mean, I'm looking at what all the governments are saying is their expected rate of return,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   and obviously I'm as good of an investor as any state government.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   Therefore, why shouldn't we use 8% on my foundation?
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.840]   I mean, that's the thinking.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   I would reckon with the state of Florida pension people.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   Aren't they the ones that keep losing hundreds of millions of dollars?
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:19.840]   I did a lot of work with somebody from the St. Petersburg Press on the Florida state pension fund,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   and what they're disclosing is they're spending $400 million or $500 million a year on their $100 billion fund,
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   but they're not disclosing the hidden cost of paying the hedge fund managers an incentive.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   They won't disclose that because they say it's confidential.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   But anyway, so I think the 8% is clearly too high, as Bill said.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   I mean, realistically, 6% is a realistic number to have on these funds,
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   and this 8% is simply to try to--from the pension fund side, it's simply to not have to fund their liabilities.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   They say, "Well, we're perfectly--we're well-funded here," or "We're close to being well-funded
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.840]   because we're using such a high discount rate on our future liabilities," which is just completely unrealistic.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   It's going to bite them in the butt, but it makes politicians look good, balances the budget.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.840]   So this is what they go with, and unfortunately foundations then look at that and naively say,
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   "Well, if this is what the state thinks they're going to get, then that's probably what we should use,"
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   but it's the wrong assumption.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   I think they call it kicking the can down the road.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   It's reality versus politics, and politics always win.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   Rick, you hinted at the presence of alternatives in a lot of these pension accounts,
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   and it's a good opportunity to check up on what exactly they've got in there
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   because I know in the state of Illinois they have increasingly been shifting assets
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   into alternative assets in an effort to boost their expected return,
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   and I think we can all agree that there are great risks in doing so, and it's a dangerous trend.
