[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.680]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.760]   Today we have a trio of interesting emails
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.020]   to work through the next three weeks, Pastor John,
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.180]   as I look ahead on the calendar of questions
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.240]   on what's on the table to come.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.400]   What does it mean to serve God?
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.640]   That's today, what does it mean to serve God?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.440]   Next week, as we serve God, what do we give him?
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.100]   Are we giving him anything that he doesn't already have?
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.160]   Does he need us?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.060]   That's APJ 1956.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.100]   And then a week after that,
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.300]   what does it mean to be spiritual?
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.580]   Spirituality, of course, is a squishy concept
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.040]   in the world today.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.780]   And we're gonna work towards a definition in APJ 1960.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260]   Interesting trio of topics, all at the foundations
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.380]   of what it means to be a successful Christian,
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.940]   living out the Christian life over the next three weeks.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.080]   Some important questions ahead.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.020]   So today, what does it mean to serve God?
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.780]   The question is from a listener named Amy.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.080]   Pastor John, hello, I was discussing the phrase
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.260]   serve the Lord with a fellow believer the other day.
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.720]   And I was wondering if you could clarify something for us.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.540]   All over scripture, we are told to serve the Lord.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.980]   In Psalm 100 verse two,
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.780]   it says to serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.420]   Deuteronomy 10, 12 says,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200]   serve the Lord with all your heart and all your soul.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020]   Joshua says, as for me and my house,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.160]   we will serve the Lord.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.300]   That's Joshua 24, 15.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.380]   And Paul in Romans 12, 11 also tells us to serve the Lord.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380]   But then in Mark 10, 45, Jesus says,
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.380]   the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.300]   Christians throw around the phrase serve the Lord so often,
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.260]   but I'm not sure I know what that phrase means.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.660]   Can you clarify this for me?
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.320]   - I think this is one of the most important questions
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.060]   a Christian can ask about living the Christian life
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.060]   in a way that glorifies God and does good to other people.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.020]   It gets at the utterly crucial issue
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.220]   of a right way of serving God
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.220]   that honors Him and blesses people,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.140]   and a wrong way of serving God
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.900]   that dishonors Him and doesn't help people.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.380]   This is not a marginal issue.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.420]   We're talking about what it means
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.580]   to be a Christian moment by moment in real life.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.580]   So let's make it crystal clear that Amy is right
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.140]   that the Bible teaches almost everywhere
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.100]   that human beings are to serve God.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.740]   And when the Son of God comes into the world,
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.800]   we are to serve Him.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.660]   Old Testament, as for me and my house,
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.660]   we will serve the Lord, Joshua 24, 15.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.140]   And then Paul celebrates the Thessalonian converts
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.140]   because, quote, you turn from idols
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.720]   to serve the living and true God.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.380]   So over and over again, Paul calls himself,
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.660]   he calls Christians servants or literally slaves
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.580]   of Christ and of God, Romans 1, 1.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.460]   Ephesians 6, 6.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.340]   Peter does the same, 1 Peter 2, 16, 2 Peter 1, 1.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.340]   It is unmistakable one biblical way of speaking rightly
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.500]   about the relationship to God that we have
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   is to call ourselves servants or slaves of God and of Christ.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.100]   That's right, she's drawing attention to that,
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.020]   and she should.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.820]   Now, as soon as we say that,
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.360]   we must ask really pointedly,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.420]   what's involved in serving God
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.660]   and what's not involved in serving God?
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.580]   If we start serving God
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.380]   as though we could earn wages from Him
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.260]   or as though we could meet His needs
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.440]   or as though we could put Him in our debt
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.380]   and make Him our beneficiary,
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.380]   red biblical lights start flashing very brightly.
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.520]   For example, in John 15, 15, Jesus says to His disciples,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   "No longer do I call you servants or slaves,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.760]   "for the servant does not know what his master's doing,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.060]   "but I have called you friends
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.220]   "for all that I have heard from my Father.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.540]   "I have made known to you."
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.540]   And yet, in verse 14, so the preceding verse,
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.220]   He says, "You are my friends
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.340]   "if you do what I command you."
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.660]   Whoa, what kind of a friend is that?
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.660]   So the meaning of slave or servant is qualified
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.760]   and the meaning of friend is qualified.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   We can't just assume that what we mean by servant or friend
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.480]   is what Jesus means by servant or friend.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.740]   We have to listen.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.620]   Or here's another bright, flashing red light.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.660]   Acts 17, verse 15,
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.260]   "God is not served by human hands
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.080]   "as though He needed anything,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.820]   "for He Himself gives to all men life and breath
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.660]   "and everything.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.660]   "So yes, serve Him, but not that way."
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.720]   Not that way.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   "Not as though He needed your service."
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.800]   Or here's another red, flashing light.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.440]   Psalm 50, verse 12.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.760]   God says, "If I were hungry,
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.680]   "I would not tell you,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.740]   "for the world and its fullness are mine.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.060]   "You call upon me in the day of trouble.
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.060]   "I'll deliver you and you will glorify me."
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.800]   That was one of Smirjn's favorite verses.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.680]   He called it Robinson Crusoe's text
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.980]   because that's what he quotes in the book.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.320]   "Yes, serve God, yes,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.960]   "but not by presuming to meet His need."
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.600]   He owns everything.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.380]   He doesn't need your supply.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.220]   We call on Him in need, not the other way around.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.040]   Here's another red, flashing light.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.920]   She quoted, Amy quoted it.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.540]   Mark 10, 45.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.560]   "The Son of Man came not to be served."
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.280]   That's pretty clear warning.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   Not to be served, but to serve
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.520]   and to give His life a ransom for many.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.460]   So He saves us.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.880]   We don't save Him.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.860]   He meets our need.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.160]   We don't meet His need.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   Here's one more flashing red light of warning
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.100]   about serving God in any old way
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.460]   that we think might be right.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.300]   Romans 4, 4.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.300]   Can't get much more basic than this.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.820]   Paul describes how the Christian life begins.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.100]   "Are we justified and put right with God
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.100]   "by working for God, earning a wage,
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.900]   "or by trusting Him to work for us
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.140]   "in our utter helplessness?"
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.020]   So here's the quote.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.000]   "To the one who works,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   "his wages are not counted as a gift, but as his due.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.060]   "And to the one who does not work,
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   "but trusts Him who justifies the ungodly,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.520]   "his faith is counted as righteousness."
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.280]   So we did not get right with God
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.160]   in the beginning of our Christian life
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.000]   by serving Him for a wage of salvation.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.760]   He worked for us.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.980]   He served us, not us, Him.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:18.240]   He did the humanly impossible on the cross.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.240]   So with all those red warning lights flashing in our face,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.840]   we better not serve God that way,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.880]   as though we could earn wages,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.840]   as though we could meet His needs,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.820]   as though we could put Him in our debt,
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.320]   make Him our beneficiary.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.680]   So here's what we need to ask.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.200]   Well, how should we serve Him?
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.400]   You keep telling us what's all the bad ways.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.920]   What is right service?
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.720]   And maybe the deepest and clearest answer
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.920]   is 1 Peter 4:11.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.600]   This gets prayed over me every time I preach it
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.440]   at Bethlehem for years and years.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.800]   This was our go-to verse
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.420]   just before walking upstairs to preach.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.420]   "Let him who serves serve in the strength that God supplies,
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.080]   "so that in everything God may get the glory
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   "through Jesus Christ to whom belongs the dominion forever."
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   So every effort expended in the service of God
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.560]   is a God-given effort.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.760]   That may be the most important sentence,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.580]   so let me say it again.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.420]   Every effort expended in the service of God,
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   the right service of God, is a God-given effort.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.760]   That's what must absolutely sink into our souls.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.800]   Otherwise, we will always think of ourselves
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.520]   as bringing to God things that He doesn't have,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.840]   as though we could meet His needs,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.420]   which He doesn't have any.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.500]   He's not served as though He needed anything.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.880]   The conception of service that dishonors God
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.360]   and will not help people
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   because it points them away from God's all-supplying grace
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.700]   toward our own supposed self-produced moral efforts
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.480]   is serving without relying upon Him
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.160]   to serve us in our serving.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   All God-pleasing service is done in the moment-by-moment
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.740]   reliance upon God's service-enabling power.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.680]   Or to say it another way,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.520]   the only service of God that pleases God
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.180]   is done through the glad acceptance
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.180]   of His undeserved service toward us and in us.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.260]   And we see this in 2 Corinthians 15, 10.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.360]   By the grace of God, I am what I am,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.860]   and His grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.440]   On the contrary, I worked, or you could say,
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.100]   I served more zealously than any of them.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.500]   And then he adds, "Though it was not I,
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.960]   but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.120]   So yes, we work.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.360]   Yes, we serve.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.460]   We have a master.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.300]   We obey.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.300]   But every baby step we take in obedience to our master
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.920]   is a gift of grace from Him to us.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.500]   Therefore, we should never think of our service to God
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   as a way to repay Him in gratitude or for His goodness to us,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:57.520]   because every step we take in that so-called payback
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.720]   is another gift from Him.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.980]   And it takes us deeper into debt to grace,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.860]   which is a glorious place to be forever and ever and ever.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.860]   We will never not be debtors to God's grace.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.960]   For all eternity, with every act of obedience,
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   glad obedience to the end of eternity, and it has no end,
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.760]   we will go deeper and happier into debt
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.240]   to the praise of the glory of His grace.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.520]   So here's one last picture
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.780]   of this peculiar kind of service to God.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.480]   Jesus said, "No one can serve two masters.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.160]   Serve two masters,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.380]   for either he will hate the one and love the other,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.240]   or he'll be devoted to the one and despise the other."
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.640]   You cannot serve God and money.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.400]   So the question is, how do you serve money?
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.640]   That would be a clue.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.600]   Serving money doesn't mean doing things
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.160]   to meet money's need.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   You serve money by calculating all your plans,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   your efforts to benefit from what money promises you.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.840]   Calculate your whole life
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.300]   to benefit from what money promises you.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.120]   Your life revolves around trying to put yourself
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.100]   in the position of the greatest benefit from money.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:36.360]   That's also what it means to serve God.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.240]   You serve God by calculating all your plans
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.680]   and all your efforts to benefit
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.760]   from all that God promises to be for you.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.360]   Your life revolves around trying to put yourself
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.080]   under the waterfall of God's greatest blessing,
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.240]   positioning yourself for the greatest benefit
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.080]   God has to give, namely, Himself.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   So I conclude, yes, God enlists us into His service,
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:10.560]   which means He calls us to have a part
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   in accomplishing His purposes, not meeting His needs.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.480]   And He accomplishes His purposes precisely
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   by supplying the grace to our work, to do our work,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.560]   because the giver gets the glory, the servant gets the joy.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.880]   And that's God's purpose for His world,
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   His glory and the joy of His people in Him.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.220]   - Amen.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.720]   Yeah, every effort expended in the service of God
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.840]   is a God-given effort.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.320]   We're not meeting His needs.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.760]   But we do give God things.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.360]   We give Him things like praise.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.200]   We give Him thanks.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.960]   We give Him glory.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.780]   We give Him power.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.720]   Give power to God.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.920]   That's Psalm 68, 34.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   Give power to God.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.500]   So how do we give God power?
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.740]   What do we give to God if we meet none of His needs?
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.040]   It's an interesting question to follow this one,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.520]   and it comes up from a listener named Jeff next time.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.280]   We'll pick it up here on Monday.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.120]   See you then.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
