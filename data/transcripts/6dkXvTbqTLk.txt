[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Well, how do we balance bold risk with wise safety?
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.360]   We don't want to be foolishly daring nor overly cautious in our love to others.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960]   It's a dilemma faced by an anonymous young woman.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.080]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm struggling to find balance with serving others.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.760]   However, sometimes when I approach my husband about certain ideas to help others, he, and
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.200]   historically others, like my pastors and parents, have told me it might be unwise.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.000]   Why is possibly risking your safety, financial comfort, and ease always considered unwise?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.160]   For example, I met a lady and her two children.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.080]   They are in a really tough temporary situation pertaining to housing and money.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.160]   My first instinct is to invite them into our home free of charge for as long as they might
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160]   need.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.720]   However, my husband said he wants to pray about it and needs to know more about who
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.080]   she is and her background before we trust her in our home.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.540]   This is where I struggle.
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.040]   What is there to pray about?
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.360]   Why should I hesitate when I see someone in need, even if I don't really know them?
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.880]   When does wisdom or safety undermine God-centered trust in our risk-taking?"
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.920]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.720]   I have struggled with this question a lot over the years, maybe partly because of where
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.620]   I live, partly because of trying to understand texts in the Bible.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.680]   And I don't want to give the impression that the Bible disregards a father's calling to
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:32.320]   protect his family, 1 Timothy 5, 8, or a disciple's obedience in fleeing from persecution, Matthew
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.320]   10, 23.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.560]   But I am going to argue that the overwhelming thrust of the New Testament is that the disciples
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.920]   of Jesus incline from the heart toward meeting needs at the risk of loss more regularly—at
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.880]   least we ought to—more regularly than we incline toward staying safe and comfortable
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.240]   by neglecting risky helpfulness.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   Or to put it another way, I don't want to prescribe precisely when love calls for self-protection
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.520]   and when love calls for self-risk, but the burden of the New Testament is to infuse the
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.200]   faith and love that leans toward self-risk rather than toward self-protection.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.760]   And I suspect the double reason for that is that on the one hand, we are by nature selfish,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.680]   and we need—I need, anyway—far more help to break free from that, that selfishness,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.580]   than I need help with living in sync with it.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.200]   And on the other hand, the second of the double reason for why the New Testament leans this
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   way is that the glory of God shines much more brightly in the counter-cultural, counter-intuitive
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   risk-taking of God's people for the sake of love than it does—than it shines in self-protection,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.440]   which pretty much looks just like the way the unbelieving world would act.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.320]   Why would they be impressed and give God glory for us acting just like them?
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:26.200]   So the way I would answer the question, "When does wisdom, safety undermine God-centered
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.480]   trust in our risk-taking?" is with these six tests.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.360]   Number one, choosing temporal safety undermines God-centered risk-taking when it doesn't
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.400]   reckon with and rejoice in the staggering reward for being plundered for love's sake.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.600]   Hebrews 10:34.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.840]   You had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.800]   property since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.400]   Test number two, choosing temporal safety undermines God-centered trust in risk-taking
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.800]   when there is no serious admiration for Paul's response to those who begged him not to risk
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.680]   his life in going up to Jerusalem in Acts 21.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.240]   "What are you doing?"
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   Paul said.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.800]   "What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.660]   Lord Jesus."
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.800]   Number three, choosing temporal safety undermines God-centered trust in risk-taking when it
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.320]   doesn't take seriously Jesus and Paul's call for disciples to be willingly taken advantage
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.120]   of rather than going to law to defend ourselves.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.760]   Matthew 5, 40-42.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.400]   And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.580]   And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.240]   Give to the one who begs from you and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.100]   Or 1 Corinthians 6, 7.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.540]   To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.740]   Why not rather suffer wrong?
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.700]   Why not rather be defrauded?
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.860]   Number four, choosing temporal safety undermines God-centered trust in risk-taking when it
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.980]   doesn't reckon seriously with the fact that the glory of God shines out to unbelievers
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.940]   through Christian behaviors that say, "Our hope is not in this world but in God and in
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.940]   heaven."
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.300]   1 Peter 3, 15.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:52.100]   Be prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   in you.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.620]   Now, why would anybody do that?
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.700]   Why would anybody ask me for a reason for the hope that is in me?
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.380]   And the answer surely is because our actions seem to indicate that our hope is not in the
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.080]   safety and comfort that they live for.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.660]   So they're puzzled and they want to know, "What makes you tick?"
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.140]   Because I wouldn't have responded like that.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.340]   And this helps make sense of Jesus' command, "Let your light shine before others that they
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.500]   can see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.340]   And then number five, choosing temporal safety undermines God-centered trust in risk-taking
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:40.420]   when it is rooted in the confidence that all possible assailants against us are in God's
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.860]   hands and cannot harm us beyond His sovereign will.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.260]   I remembered in thinking about this of John Bunyan, who I spoke about some years ago and
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.660]   remember reading his book, "Counsels for Sufferers."
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:02.380]   He spent 12 years of his life in prison when he could have gotten out by agreeing not to
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.820]   preach and gotten out and taken care of his wife and four kids, one of whom was blind.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:15.340]   And he comments on Daniel 5:23, which is this, "And you, Belshazzar, have not humbled your
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:24.260]   heart, but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven and the God in whose hand
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.580]   is your breath and whose are all your ways.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.700]   You have not honored."
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:37.940]   And here's Bunyan's comment, "Wherefore, as we should," and so again, "we should not be
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.220]   afraid of men."
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.300]   We should be afraid of them because they will hurt us, but we should not be afraid of them
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.660]   as if they were let loose to do us anything they will.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.340]   God's bridle is upon them.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.020]   God's hook is in their nose.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.900]   Yea, and God has determined the bounds of their rage.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:10.180]   Number six, finally, choosing temporal safety undermines God-centered trust in risk-taking
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:18.780]   when it is not enjoying deep freedom from the love of money and things rooted in the
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:24.740]   promises of God to take care of us, just like Hebrews 13, 5 makes so clear.
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.500]   "Keep your life free from the love of money and be content with what you have, for he
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.420]   has said, 'I will never leave you or forsake you.'"
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:41.780]   So we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper, I will not fear, what can man do to
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.780]   me?"
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:50.020]   Now that list of six tests for how to undermine risk-taking trust could go on and on, but
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.620]   let me just end with this.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.460]   Don't miss the joy.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.620]   I think I'd be saying this to her husband.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:03.980]   Don't miss the joy, the deep, amazing joy that comes from overcoming fear and taking
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.580]   the risks of love.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:13.540]   It is short-sighted to think that the comfort and security of not taking a risk is more
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:21.980]   satisfying to the soul than the joy of trusting God in the risky path of love, for what you
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.660]   can't see, can't foresee what's going to happen.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:33.300]   At the front end of such love, the flesh is screaming, "No, no, no, too risky, too risky,"
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:41.380]   and the spirit is whispering, "There is great Christ-exalting joy in this to be had."
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:48.980]   So I'm just suggesting don't miss the whisper for the screaming, and don't miss the joy.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.580]   Boy, that is a relevant word for me to hear.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.260]   Well, whether you listen in the car, at the gym, doing chores, thanks for inviting us

[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:15.300]   Well, Jesus came to bring violence, to bring a sword.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.380]   He said so.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.940]   So what does that mean for us today?
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.300]   The question comes from a listener in Egypt.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.540]   It's up next time on Monday.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.940]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.300]   We'll see you then.
