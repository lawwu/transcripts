[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right, let us keep rolling. Who do we have next?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   All right, next question is from Allison, 30 year old lawyer. This year, Facebook and Instagram
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   have started flooding their users feeds with suggested posts from accounts they don't follow.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.680]   Many users are frustrated and angry about these changes. What impact do you think these changes
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.120]   are going to have on the future of Facebook and Instagram? All right, well, Allison, I've talked
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.000]   about this before, so I'll be short, but add a new twist to it. The source document to look at here
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.200]   is the article I wrote for The New Yorker on TikTok. This probably came out,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.360]   God, I don't know when this was, the summer, early fall. I don't know when that was, Jesse,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.520]   but you look it up. Okay. Anyways, and I talked about it on the show, I believe at some point.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.320]   In fact, it was an article that came out of ideas we first introduced on the show. And basically,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.560]   my premise was Facebook and Instagram following TikTok's lead to having more and more information
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.680]   selected algorithmically and having no connection to people that you follow or to the things that
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.400]   people you follow shared. I said, ultimately, this is going to be the doom of those services.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.000]   So I'll briefly recapitulate my argument why. The way I think about TikTok now, my shorthand
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.320]   for TikTok right now is that it's Blue's Clues for adults. So Blue's Clues is a children's program
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.880]   that became really popular in the 1990s. And I know about it because Malcolm Gladwell wrote a
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.480]   chapter about Blue's Clues in his seminal book, The Tipping Point. And what he argued in The
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   Tipping Point is compare Blue's Clues to Sesame Street, and you see something very different.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.480]   I mean, Sesame Street is legible to adults. You see what they're trying to do. It's educational
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.400]   content. It has these interesting puppets. There's some in-jokes for the adults. It's funny. There's
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.360]   some good writing in it. And so they're trying to help children learn, but it's kind of an
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.960]   interestingly crafted thing. You can have it on as a grownup and not hate it. And it's a well-done
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.680]   show. Blue's Clues, if you've ever seen this, baffles adults. It's repetitive. It makes no
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.720]   sense. The characters will just look to camera and repeat themselves four or five times. They'll
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.160]   just pause for a while. It seems insipid. It seems arbitrary. It seems almost nihilistic in its
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.800]   incoherence. And it was incredibly popular. And what Malcolm Gladwell wrote about in The
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.200]   Tipping Point is what they did for that show was they basically studied kids and worked entirely
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.800]   off the metric of what grabs their attention and what doesn't. And so they built a whole TV show
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.920]   around just the simple goal of how do I keep kids' attention on here? And the result was
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.880]   this incoherent to adults audio-visual assault mishmash. And there was actually a lot of this
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.760]   that arose in the '90s. Barney's gave way to Teletubbies, these shows that were so weird to
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.480]   adults. Sesame Street was funny. It'd be like, hey, here comes, you know, Stalker Channing is
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.040]   going to come on and do a skit with garbage, whatever his name was, Oscar the Grouch. And
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   it's about letters. And it's also kind of funny. And there's some good writing. And it's kind of
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.000]   winking at the audience. And then it's Teletubbies, your eyes are melting. It's Blue's Clues, like,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.520]   what's going on? Why is it just staring at the screen, waiting for the kids to repeat a word
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.600]   or whatever? And it's because it was engineered to be a simple metric, what's going to keep kids
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   looking. In the world of social media, Facebook and Instagram is Sesame Street. TikTok is Blue's
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.120]   Clues. They got rid of any of the potentially good stuff, the connection to other people,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.880]   the seeing what people you know are up to, the expression, the discovery of interesting things,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.320]   and made it just what gets your eyes affixed to this as long as possible. And the result is this
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   format that, again, to a non-TikTok user is incoherent, is mind melting. It's these weird,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   short videos with cuts and movements. And all it is is Blue's Clues. It is what happens when you
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.360]   push a content to its logical extreme in the context of attention maximization. And so just
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.960]   like adults look at Blue's Clues, like, this feels just, I think a lot of adults look at TikTok,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.440]   like, we're not even pretending anymore that this is unlocking the power of the web. It's just
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.480]   the logical terminal space of when you're saying, let's just maximize eyes, eyes, eyes.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   Okay, so TikTok is Blue's Clues for adult. If Facebook and Instagram follow that path,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.840]   they're getting rid of all the stuff that's quality. They're getting rid of all the potential
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.320]   value proposition of connecting the people you know, discovering things from people like you,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.560]   and it just becomes what's going to keep my toddler slack jawed at the screen while I'm
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.520]   trying to get something done. Once they move into that arena, they have lost their main competitive
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.560]   advantage, which is their social graphs. As I argued in that New Yorker piece, it is too hard
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.920]   at this point to build a social graph of the same size and of the same value as a Twitter, Instagram,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.960]   or Facebook. So any service that's mainly based on one of those social graphs is not able to compete
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.560]   with those. But as soon as they move away from their social graph, here's friends and links,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.280]   and just to algorithmically select the content, they're just in the competitive mosh pit with
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.920]   everything else is trying to grab your attention. And Blue's Clues isn't on TV anymore, because
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240]   there's other cartoons that came along or even more insipid and even more attention capturing.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.560]   So that's why I think Allison, the move of Facebook and Instagram towards a Blue's Clues
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.600]   TikTok model, maybe is trying to stave off some user, user loss in the short term, but is going
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.240]   to expose them to competition that they can't hope to win at long term. When they left the advantage
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   of their social graph, they left their protection. And I think that's going to be the end of them,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.400]   ultimately of them as some sort of giant culture shaping monopolistic platform that everyone uses.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.760]   Your article came out July 28.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.720]   July 28. Okay, so that's the TikTok. What's it called?
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.400]   TikTok and the fall of social media giants.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:26.160]   TikTok and the fall of social media giants.
