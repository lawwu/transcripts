[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   [no audio]
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.620]   ...welcoming our special guest of honor, Jack Vogel.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:26.620]   [applause]
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.120]   Well, I don't usually talk too much. [laughter]
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.620]   I don't know. How are you?
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.620]   What's to be said?
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.620]   I guess the biggest treat of all, it's always wonderful to see all of you.
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.620]   But there's... honestly...
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.620]   I think it gives me quite a thrill.
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620]   As much of a thrill as seeing my dear friend Taylor Leckermore.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.620]   He represents the best that's in this country,
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.620]   the best that is investing, the highest charity.
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.620]   He represents... well, let's put it this way,
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.620]   everything I want to be when I grow up.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:18.620]   [laughter and applause]
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620]   I don't have too much time to get there.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620]   But it's great to see you all.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.620]   And I'm gonna...
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620]   Is pretty much everybody here tonight, so I don't have to repeat myself in the morning?
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620]   [laughter]
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.620]   Okay. Well, I'm looking forward to being with you tomorrow.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.620]   I think Bill Bernstein is not going to be here.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.620]   He's in the hospital. He's being operated on.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.620]   And Bill's going to probably show up in a wheelchair.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620]   Well, that reminds me of me.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.620]   [laughter]
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620]   There are these two questions everybody asks me.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.620]   What happened? How did it happen?
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.620]   The answer is very easy.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620]   I fractured scapula and stupidity.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.620]   [laughter]
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620]   But three days after it happened, or four,
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.620]   I was asked to give the keynote speech
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.620]   to the 70th anniversary of the Financial Analysts of Philadelphia
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.620]   at the Constitution Center,
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.620]   which made it very difficult for me to resist.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.620]   That's something I've been involved in all my adult years, I guess.
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.620]   And so my wife said, "You're not doing it, are you?"
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620]   [laughter]
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620]   And I said, "Well, I am."
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620]   And she said, "Why?"
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.620]   And I said, "Because when I make a commitment, I'm used to keeping it."
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.620]   Not all is true. This is the apocryphal part.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620]   She said, "Well, what if you were dead?"
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620]   [laughter]
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.620]   And I said, "Honestly, I think I'd do it anyway."
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.620]   [laughter]
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.620]   I think I would.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620]   I mean, they're not going to keep me from being with you tomorrow morning.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.620]   It's going to be a little more heavy lifting than I would want to do
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.620]   without Bill Bernstein's absence.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.620]   Unless he gets here, which we can't be sure of.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.620]   So I'll be talking to you then.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.620]   I'm having a good time, I think, trying to answer your questions.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.620]   I always start by saying,
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.620]   let's have a lot fewer slides than last year.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620]   I think we have eight more.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.620]   [laughter]
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.620]   So we'll just do the best we can.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.620]   It's all very informal, as you know.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.620]   I look forward to doing it.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.620]   It gives me a chance to put some things down.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.620]   Well, I don't put them quite down in black and white.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.620]   But there'll be slides there.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.620]   And I have a lot of ideas that I think I'd like to talk to you about.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.620]   Things that are going on now, things that are going to happen this year,
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.620]   and things we ought to be thinking about in the future.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.620]   So it's fun to do all that.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.620]   And fun to share it with a group of people
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.620]   who care so deeply about helping one another
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.620]   and observing what's going on.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.620]   My God, you're unbelievable.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.620]   I was going over some of the background for tomorrow,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.620]   and I happened to get to the thing about the front-line report on retired clients.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.620]   And I look, and I'm thanking you for writing 262 posts.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620]   262 posts.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.620]   I didn't even dare look it all up before I came over here.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.620]   But we do have a bunch of questions from you in advance,
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.620]   which Bill--thank you very much, Bill--has succeeded in getting together.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.620]   And then I think we'll also try and do what we did last year,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.620]   and that is it's fun to get these questions from afar.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.620]   But we also have some--we'll take some questions from in the air.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.620]   So we'll do live Q&A, too.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.620]   And I will be--what's the phrase I want to use?
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.620]   Completely outspoken.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.620]   A statement to which I aspire and, alas, don't always achieve.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.620]   But there's a lot of interesting things going on in the world,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.620]   in the government, to say the least, at Vanguard,
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.620]   and for investors in a kind of a time where the answers are not easy
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.620]   and the answers are not forthcoming, the answers are not written.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.620]   But in a way, that kind of uncertainty has permeated investing forever.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.620]   Just different levels and degrees.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.620]   So we put up with it. We do the best we can.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.620]   And it works.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.620]   And I get letters from the likes of you all every single day
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.620]   from shareholders without--nothing is a complaint.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.620]   Somebody purchased $500,000 for the Mendex 500 at the high in 2007,
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.620]   and thanked me for all we'd done for him since then.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.620]   God knows where he was coming from.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.620]   But he did stay with us, and now somebody can tell me the number.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.620]   20% cap income, 25% higher than he was then.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.620]   All very counterintuitive.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.620]   And I could tell a whole story about one of the great bureaus at Vanguard, Gus Sillard.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.620]   Is it okay if I tell a story like that?
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:00.620]   Around February 10, 2009, the market had gone down 55%.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.620]   And I don't see nearly as much of Gus as I used to.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.620]   We happened to run into each other in the hall.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.620]   And he was heading for somewhere, and I was headed for somewhere in our paths.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.620]   And we got talking about the market, and the 55% declined.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.620]   And he said to me, "You know, if I had to make a guess,
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.620]   I'd say this is going to be the best time to put your money to work in the stock market in our lifetimes."
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.620]   And I said, "Would you say that publicly?"
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:39.620]   And he said, "Are you kidding?"
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.620]   I only forget the ones where I look bad.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.620]   But we live in that kind of a world where it doesn't seem to pay to go out on a limb.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.620]   I guess in terms of anybody in the business, I go out as far as one would dare.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.620]   But I'm always not looking at today or tomorrow or the next day or the next decade, even longer than that.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.620]   So let me stop at that point.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620]   Thank you again for coming.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.620]   It's great to be with you.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.620]   And I'm looking forward to seeing you in the morning.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.620]   I will be with you at 8.30 if you don't know.
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.620]   Thank you.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.620]   I've got a story that you may really get a kick out of.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.620]   You know, a recent story that Anna did in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.620]   She also did a podcast where somebody interviewed her, somebody from the journal interviewed her,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.620]   and they had it posted on the Internet.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.620]   And a lot of the bogo heads went and saw the podcast.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:41.620]   And at the end of the podcast, the interviewer asked Anna if there was any special requirement to join the bogo heads.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.620]   And she said no.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.620]   Anybody can join.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.620]   They don't have a secret handshake.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.620]   [Laughter]
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.620]   So somebody said, well, maybe we ought to get a secret handshake.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.620]   [Laughter]
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.620]   Did you see it?
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.620]   That's it.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.620]   Index finger.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.620]   So anyway, I said, all right, let's have a contest to see who can come up with the best secret handshake.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.620]   This is good.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.620]   He's good.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   And we got one entry immediately after, and I closed the contest.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.620]   [Laughter]
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:20.620]   I thought it was the most brilliant thought that I -- it is an index finger shake.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.620]   [Laughter]
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.620]   Victoria, where's Victoria?
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.620]   Victoria, there she is.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:40.620]   [Applause]
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.620]   You wouldn't pick mine, would you?
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.620]   [Laughter]
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.620]   So we now --
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   Now everybody knows.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.620]   No, here's the deal.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:09:00.620]   I wrote down there that people are going to wonder how non-bogo heads will -- that will now know our secret handshake.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:09.620]   And I said that anybody who's a true bogo head will remember, and anybody who is not a true bogo head will have instant memory loss.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.620]   [Laughter]
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.620]   Our secret is our secret.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   All right.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.620]   In honor of that, she is now Lady Victoria.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.620]   [Laughter]
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:25.620]   [Applause]
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.620]   I had to explain it to Taylor.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.620]   At least you got it.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.620]   [Laughter]
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.620]   No, I was going to ask her, "What's a podcast?"
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.620]   [Laughter]
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.620]   It's just a video.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.620]   It's all right.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.620]   No, I got that far.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.620]   [Laughter]
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.620]   I wasn't sure.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.620]   Thank you.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.620]   [Applause]
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.680]   you
