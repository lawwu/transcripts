[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   We apologize that due to a fault on the original recording, the first few seconds of this sermon
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.960]   by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones are missing.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.000]   However, we join him now during the reading of the verse.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.240]   "Singing and making melody in your heart or from the heart to the Lord.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.840]   And then he goes on to say what we are considering this morning in this twentieth verse.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.480]   And here we would remind one another that he still obviously has in his mind that same
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.400]   contrast, the contrast between the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.320]   He has been emphasizing this in the previous parts of this epistle.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.440]   He is trying to show these Ephesian Christians how, now that they have become born again,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   as he puts it, and as they have received new life in Christ, the whole of their outlook
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.800]   and of their life will be essentially different from what it was before.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.140]   And now he is coming down to these details of how all this shows itself in their relationships
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.240]   with one another and in their common acts of worship and of praise to God.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.640]   Well now, we proceed therefore immediately to the consideration of what he says in this
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640]   verse.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640]   "Giving thanks."
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.500]   That's it.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.120]   This is ever one of the most characteristic things about people who are filled with the
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120]   Spirit.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.520]   Nothing, perhaps, is more characteristic of them than just this very thing.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.760]   They have a sense of gratitude to God and they are filled with a sense of praise and
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.680]   of thanksgiving to him for all his abundant and abounding mercies.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.720]   Here, you see, we see at once this element of complete contrast with those who are not
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   Christians.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.120]   They don't thank God.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   If ever they mention his name, it's to complain.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.160]   You know the type of person who never talks about God, never believes in worshipping God
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.360]   or thanking God for anything.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   Then a war suddenly comes and they say, "Is this you, a God?
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.060]   Why does God allow war?"
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.240]   These people have always got their catch questions.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   If there is a God and God's a God of love, why this spastic child and so on?
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.040]   No thanks at all.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   No praise.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.920]   God's never mentioned by them, except it be, as I say, to criticize, to grumble or
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   to complain.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.640]   There is a whole attitude.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:01.480]   The apostle is contrasting this other attitude, giving thanks always for all things and to
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.560]   God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.800]   This of course is something which is quite inevitable.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.360]   The Holy Spirit operating in us always leads to this.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.880]   There are certain things which invariably happen when the Holy Spirit is present in
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   power.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.400]   We have been studying a lot this year the whole question of revival.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   You can't read the account of any revival that has ever happened in the history of the
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.840]   Church without finding that it has always been an occasion of great thanksgiving and
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   of praise.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.280]   Your hymns show that.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.120]   The great hymns that come out of revival are always hymns of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.760]   That is the thing that the people are most conscious of, the goodness and the grace and
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.560]   the mercy of God.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.640]   They pour forth their hearts in praise and in thanksgiving.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.200]   As the Holy Spirit operates upon us, I say, inevitably leads to that end.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.840]   For what he does is this.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.560]   The apostle has prayed for these Ephesians in the very first chapter that the eyes of
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.520]   their understanding might be enlightened.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.120]   He reminds them of that.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.720]   Ever since he was with them, he has been praying in that he says, "I cease not to give thanks
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.600]   for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.980]   Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.640]   of him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened."
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.040]   That is always the work of the Spirit.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   What does he do?
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.400]   Well, he opens our understanding to these things, that we may know what is the hope
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.880]   of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.840]   what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us that believe.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.920]   So you see, when the Holy Spirit is present in power, when people are filled with the
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.960]   Spirit, their minds are enlightened, they are given the knowledge, given understanding,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.440]   and they are aware of certain things about God and his relationship to them.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.400]   And of course, you cannot have that knowledge without being moved by it.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.440]   But the Holy Spirit, in addition, moves and works upon the heart.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.100]   His operations are never confined to the mind alone.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.820]   He starts by enlightening the mind.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.600]   But the difference between a man who has merely got intellectual knowledge and apprehension
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.800]   of the truth, and a man who is rarely filled with the Spirit, is that the second man's
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.840]   heart is moved.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.760]   The Holy Spirit has a mighty influence upon the hearts of men.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.520]   It softens them, it warms them, melts them, stimulates them.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.680]   And the result is that here is a man whose mind and understanding are enlightened, he
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.000]   is aware of these things, and his heart is melted and warmed and moved, and the two work
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.360]   together.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:35.000]   And inevitably, the man is filled with a great spirit of thanksgiving and of praise unto
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   God.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.440]   He is a man who, though he feels all this, would still like to thank God more and more,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:54.080]   so he prays, "Come, thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace."
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   Now then, here is something which surely will come to us as a question this morning.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.560]   It is a very good test of the nature and the character of our Christian life and our spiritual
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.680]   tone.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.880]   To what extent is there this element of praise and of thanksgiving in our life and in our
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.280]   experience?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.960]   Stop for a moment and examine yourself and ask yourself the question, "When you are
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.200]   on your knees in the presence of God, what do you do there?"
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:41.160]   To what extent do we thank God and praise God, giving thanks always for all things,
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   says the apostle?
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.600]   Of course, a man who is filled with a spirit will do that.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.920]   So we are able to tell very easily this morning to what extent we are filled with the Spirit.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   This is the gauge.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.560]   It tells us exactly.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.760]   I wonder how we emerge from this examination.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.120]   Analyze your prayer.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.540]   How much space and time and attention are given to praise and to thanksgiving?
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.080]   How much to petition?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.720]   It is the relative proportions of petition and praise and thanksgiving that tell most
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:28.640]   exactly the measure, the degree of the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   A man whose spiritual life is poor and weak, merasmic, is a man who spends his time in
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   petitioning God, and there is no praise at all.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.160]   It is a curious thing, this.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.000]   Here is a man who wants this and that and feels he has not got it and doubts whether
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.720]   God is dealing with him fairly.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.200]   Of course, there is only one explanation of such a man.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.760]   He is not aware of the truth concerning God.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   He is probably disobedient to God.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.240]   He is not conforming to the life and to the pattern, and that is why he is not being blessed
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.640]   more than he is being blessed.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.680]   But the man on the other hand who has this enlightenment of the Holy Spirit and who is
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:23.840]   moved in his heart, he wants to praise God and to thank God above everything else.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:30.600]   There is nothing to me more alarming and more appalling about the way in which, alas, probably
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.640]   most of us live.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.520]   We are all guilty of this.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:44.840]   The way I say in which we do not thank God, we either just say our prayers mechanically
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:53.760]   or we have a series of petitions for ourselves and for various other people in whom we are
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.760]   interested.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.040]   What makes it still more terrible is that we are rather proud of ourselves for having
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.600]   done that, especially if we have a prayer list and we offer up petitions for a number
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   of people.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   Now, do not misunderstand me.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   It is very good to pray for people.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.520]   If you have promised to pray for a missionary or something, do so.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.800]   We can never do so too much.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.080]   But I still say that the measure of our spiritual tone and whole condition is the element of
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   thanksgiving and of praise that is in our prayer life and in all our thinking about
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.680]   God, giving thanks always.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.560]   "This is inevitable," says Paul.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:37.400]   "You will be singing, making melody in your hearts to the Lord and giving thanks."
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.640]   What a happy people Christian people are!
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.400]   "Here you are," he says, "you are met together.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.480]   You are unlike those people in their drunken orgies.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.720]   You are unlike those people with their ribald songs, their attempt at jollification and
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   happiness.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.480]   Yours is a true happiness and it comes welling up out of your hearts."
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   It is not a mechanical thanksgiving.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.000]   I do not know anything that is more terrible in a sense than formal thanksgiving.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I am not saying that we should not even give thanks formally.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.880]   It is quite right that you should do so, but it is a terrible thing if it is merely formal.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.320]   You know, when you receive formal thanks from somebody, it does not really help you.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.280]   It does not give you any pleasure at all.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.360]   You are much more aware of their formality than you are of the thanksgiving that is in
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   their hearts.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.680]   All this, says Paul, comes from the heart.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.040]   You make melody in your heart.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.240]   You thank God from the heart.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:44.040]   Not a formal praise, but a praise that comes welling up from the depths and a feeling that
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.880]   we cannot do it enough.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:53.080]   And again, we ask God to tune our hearts to sing his grace and his praise aright.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.500]   Very well.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.880]   We just examine ourselves in the light of that.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.440]   So let us go on to the second thing the apostle tells us.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.080]   Notice to whom he tells us to give our thanks.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.360]   You observe that he divides his statement.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:17.240]   Giving thanks, he says, always, for all things, unto God and the Father.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.380]   He means by that, of course, God the Father.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.080]   But this is the way he commonly puts it.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.240]   And I think he puts it in this way very deliberately in order to remind us of something.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.360]   We give thanks unto God, the Almighty and Eternal God.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.160]   Here he is thinking of God as the Creator.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.040]   As the author of all being.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.600]   And we should give thanks unto God for that.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.520]   God is the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.920]   He is the source and the fount of every blessing.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:06.040]   God is, I say, the author of all life, of the whole universe, and of everything that
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   is.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.200]   So he says, give thanks to God.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.480]   And this is a permanent duty.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.240]   This is something that everybody should be doing.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.160]   Even those who are not Christians should be doing this.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.860]   God is to be praised.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.000]   Let the people praise the old people.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.280]   The whole universe should be thanking God and praising God this morning as God.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.440]   As the giver of all gifts, the source and the fount of every blessing.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.120]   Ah yes, but you see the apostle at once hurries on to add something.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.920]   Now then, here is where he has a special word for the Christian.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.880]   To the Christian, God is not only God, he is God.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.600]   He is God the Creator.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.720]   He is the everlasting God.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.000]   But he is in particular the Father.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.720]   He has become one whom the Christian can address as his Father.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.800]   Now this is not true of all.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.520]   As our Lord said, "Ye are of your father the devil."
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.440]   That is true of some people.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.400]   This notion of the universal fatherhood of God is not taught in the scriptures.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   God is the Creator.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.280]   If you like, you can say that he is Father in that sense.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.100]   But he is not Father to all and sundry.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:48.280]   He is only Father to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.800]   He came unto his own and his own received him not, but to as many as received him.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:00.280]   To them he gave the right of the authority to become the children of God.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.720]   That is it.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.120]   And as I say, our Lord says to these people, to these Jews who did not believe in him,
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.840]   "You are of your father the devil."
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.120]   "Do not say that God is your father," he said.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.560]   "You say that you are children of Abram, that you are children of God."
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.400]   But he says, "You are not children of God.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.680]   If you were children of God, you would not be rejecting me and reviling me and blaspheming
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   me.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.960]   You are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye will do."
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.440]   Oh no, they are not children of God.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.880]   God is not their father.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.640]   They are in the relationship of created beings to Creator, but no more.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:47.240]   But here the apostle reminds Christian people that they are in an entirely different category.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:55.360]   That God has become to them their father in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.880]   Very well, then let us see how this works itself out.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.760]   He is very careful to put it like this in order to remind us of what our duty is, what
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.360]   we ought to be doing as filled with the Spirit, and in order that we might test and examine
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.280]   ourselves.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.560]   In other words, the thanksgiving and the praise of the Christian should be altogether
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:25.400]   greater and more abundant, more full of, than that of anyone who is not a Christian.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.760]   Well let us look at how he divides it up.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.320]   For what are we to give thanks?
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:36.200]   Well, he says that we are to give thanks unto God and the Father always, always.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.040]   And when he says always, he really means always.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.160]   Well in what respect?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:49.600]   Well, we are to give thanks unto God always, as God.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.120]   How does that work out, says someone?
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.520]   Well, it means something like this.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.280]   We should always be thanking God for the very gift of life itself.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.480]   For it is God who has given us our being, and not we ourselves, as one of the psalmists
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.960]   reminds us.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.360]   Man with all his cleverness and all his advances cannot create or produce life.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.840]   God is the author of life and of being.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.080]   He gives us all our existence.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:27.560]   And this is something for which we should thank God, that he has made us men, that he
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.040]   has given us the gift of life and has put us into this world.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.800]   It is a tremendous thing.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.680]   We will never understand it fully, but we should thank God for it.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.440]   But we don't stop at that.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.200]   Consider other matters for which we should be always thanking God.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:53.000]   Think of some of the provisions he has made for us and for our lives in this world.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.560]   It is God, you know, who has ordained the family.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.920]   It is only right that we should remind ourselves of these things from time to time.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.620]   It is God, let us never forget, who ordained marriage.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.240]   It was God who gave men a helpmate, the woman to be with him.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.920]   It is he who ordained marriage.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.880]   This is not a human institution.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.780]   It isn't a good idea that some men suddenly conceived.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.800]   It isn't something that has evolved out of the development of human beings.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.720]   No, it is God who deliberately ordained it, planned it, fashioned it, told men all about
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   it.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:38.740]   God, at the very beginning, ordained marriage and the family as the fundamental unit, so
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.900]   that when we come into this world, we are not left as it were on the cold doorsteps
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.980]   of life.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.620]   We come into the bosom of a family.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.900]   We are surrounded by affection and love and care and protection.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.360]   My dear friend, do you ever thank God for that?
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.700]   It is God who has ordained it.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.780]   We are not born like animals and allowed more or less to struggle and fend for ourselves
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.620]   from the very beginning.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:11.340]   God has ordained these wonderful ordinances to care for us and to cover our needs and
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.020]   to protect us and to help us.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.620]   Giving thanks unto God always.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.420]   Not a day should pass but that we thank God for these things.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.180]   We will then think of food and clothing and shelter.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.940]   You know these things come from God.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.220]   If God were to withhold the sun and the rain, we would have no food.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.940]   It is no use talking to me about your tractors and your mud and implements and all your fertilizers
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.220]   and all the rest of it.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:45.260]   They would be of no value at all if God did not send the rain and give the sun.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.180]   Our daily bread comes from God.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:54.180]   In spite of men's efforts, it would be useless, but for God, he is the giver.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.180]   Giving thanks always, day by day.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:02.460]   We should never eat food without giving thanks to God because it has come from him.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:09.620]   Likewise, our clothing, shelter, and all these other gifts, health and strength, these again,
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.540]   I say, are gifts from God.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.300]   This is something that is universal.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:21.820]   You remember our Lord reminds us in the Sermon on the Mount that God maketh his sun to rise
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:28.940]   on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:35.660]   So the evil and the unjust ought to be thanking God for the sunshine and for the rain.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.220]   Well, if they should, how much more those of us who are Christian.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.460]   And then think of something like this.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:54.980]   Think of the personal gifts that we all enjoy in some shape or form.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:01.340]   Everybody is endowed with certain powers and faculties and propensities.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.380]   You may be an able or clever person.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:12.300]   You may be clever in one respect or another, mathematically, scientifically, musically,
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.300]   dramatically, I don't care what it is.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.300]   Think of all the gifts which people have.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.420]   Some have the gift of understanding.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.740]   Others are wonderful with their hands and can make and can fashion things.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.980]   Others have discernment and judgment and all these things.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.460]   Yes, but you know, here's the question.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.660]   Where did you get those gifts from?
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.660]   Have you created them?
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.940]   You're proud of them, perhaps.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.820]   Well, have you a right to be?
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.820]   Did you produce them?
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.780]   Have you generated these things?
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.820]   Are they something that you conjured up from somewhere?
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.220]   Are they really the result of your efforts?
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.260]   Of course they're not.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.660]   You are born with them.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.260]   And it is God who's given you them.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.340]   We glory in a man like Shakespeare, you see, but we should thank God that he can give men
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.060]   such gifts.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.780]   We are living in an age when we praise men as if men had done everything.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.580]   But not that men have done anything except by the ability which God has given him, that
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.180]   scriptural teaching.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.460]   What hast thou but that which thou hast received.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.340]   It is all as the result of the ability which God giveth.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.580]   And of course it's only as we begin to look into these things and understand them that
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.540]   we not only praise God aright, but we know how to live aright.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.100]   Think of all the trouble in the world because men are proud of their gifts and others are
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.900]   envious of them, and how the gifted people despise the others, and so on.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.100]   And all the trouble that that causes in life and in the world.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.780]   It's all due of course to this, that none of them realize that they've all got their
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.900]   gifts from God.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.940]   He is the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.820]   So we should be giving thanks unto God always for all these things.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.060]   Do we do so, Christian people?
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.380]   Or do we take these things for granted?
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.780]   These are the gifts that come from God.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.660]   Then think of his long suffering, his kindness to us, his patience with us, with all of us.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.940]   It is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.020]   The world's in a terrible state and the foolish people, the ignorant people say, "Where's
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.020]   your God?
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.380]   Why does God allow this?"
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.020]   What we all should be saying is this, "How does God tolerate us at all?
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.180]   How are things as good as they are?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.740]   It's nothing but the long suffering, the compassion, the kindness of God.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.340]   How can he stand it?
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.780]   Why doesn't he wipe us out of existence?
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.980]   Why doesn't he chastise us with an awful severity?"
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.220]   That's how we ought to be speaking.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.540]   Well now then, there is one respect in which we give thanks always unto God.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:58.420]   Yes, but now then, go on to the second bit, to the Father.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.700]   And this is what the Christian alone can do.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:06.220]   Our hymn which we sang just now puts it in a phrase, "We thank him for all that he
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:12.180]   sends us through his Son.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.340]   Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.500]   What are we talking about?
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.660]   Well, this is what I'm talking about.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.060]   We say we are Christian people.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.540]   Very well then, why is it that we don't spend the whole of our time in thanking God?
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.540]   What for?
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.980]   Well, for the fact that he's never looked upon us at all.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.540]   We like everybody else were the children of wrath.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.380]   We are born in sin.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.960]   In sin did my mother conceive me.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.660]   We are children of iniquity, every one of us.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.700]   We all deserve hell and nothing else.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.740]   Does anybody dispute that?
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.220]   Examine your life then.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.460]   Have you thanked God for all his goodness to you, for his very gift of life, that you're
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.420]   a man, that he's given you a soul?
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.340]   What do we deserve at the hands of God?
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.980]   We've broken his laws.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.800]   Every one of us, like sheep, has gone astray.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.580]   Everyone has followed his own devices.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.500]   We deserve nothing but punishment and hell.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:18.980]   But God has looked upon us with a piteous and a merciful eye.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:29.700]   God has chosen us and called us out of darkness into his most marvelous light.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:35.180]   God in spite of our sin and rebellion and recalcitrance has loved us with an everlasting
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:41.500]   love and has sent his only Son into our world and even to the death of the cross in order
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.980]   to save us and to redeem us.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.420]   He's forgiven us freely.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.700]   He's blotted out our transgressions as a thick cloud.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.740]   He's thrown our sins into the sea of his own forgetfulness.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:08.500]   We stand before him justified, reconciled, absolutely absolved from all our sins.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:14.780]   Is it surprising that the apostle says, "Giving thanks always unto the Father"?
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.180]   But wait a minute, we haven't finished.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.940]   He's given us new life.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.660]   We are made partakers of the divine nature.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.740]   He has put his Holy Spirit to dwell within us.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:33.500]   He has delivered us from the thralldom and the tyranny and the sin of the world.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.300]   He looks upon us as his children.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.860]   The very hairs of our head are all numbered.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:45.580]   He leads us, he guides us, he cares for us in his wonderful providence.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.500]   Then think of the blessings he gives us in connection with the life of the church, all
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.780]   we inherit by way of knowledge, exposition of the truth, the lives of men who have gone
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.780]   before us.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.460]   He has brought us into a large and into a wealthy place.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:08.580]   And then think of the prospect that lies ahead of us, the prospect of going to glory, to
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:15.260]   be with Christ, which is far better, to spend eternity in the presence of God, to be in
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.620]   the renovated, regenerated earth which is coming, the new heavens and the new earth
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:26.540]   wherein dwelleth righteousness, to reign with Christ as kings, to judge the world, to judge
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.660]   angels.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.260]   All that is coming and he's preparing us for that.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:38.020]   It is because of things like that that the apostle says, "Giving thanks always."
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.580]   Always.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.780]   Because you see, if you're a Christian, these things are always true.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.020]   I don't care what you're feeling like, I don't care what's happening to you, these
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.780]   things if you're a Christian are always true.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:55.100]   If you are a Christian, it means this, that God saw you before the foundation of the world
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.820]   and wrote your name in the Lamb's book of life, before the foundation of the world,
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.200]   you.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.780]   What is the matter with us Christian people that we don't give thanks unto God the Father
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.260]   always?
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.220]   He has chosen you.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.660]   He has separated you from the world.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:25.220]   He has put you into Christ, made you a member of the body of Christ.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:30.100]   He's got this marvellous plan and program for you.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.100]   He loves you, I say, with an everlasting love.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:40.180]   This relationship of the Christian to God the Father is permanent, it is certain, it
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.380]   is forever, and it's always there and always true.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.220]   Well, why are we not always thanking him?
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:56.500]   Do you thank him for things like that every day of your life?
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.780]   If we don't, of course, there's only one reason for it, we don't think about these
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.360]   things.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.140]   We sort of say, "I'm a Christian," we put that into a compartment.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.580]   Now then, there are a number of things I want, but fancy taking that for granted.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.420]   I sometimes have put it like this, and I put it again like this this morning.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.820]   If we are not amazed and astounded and surprised every day of our lives that we are Christian,
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.460]   well, we are very poor Christians.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.940]   If you are not thrilled at the fact that you are in this position as a child of God and
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.940]   an heir of eternity and of glory with Christ, if that doesn't thrill you to the marrow
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:40.100]   of your being day by day, well, there's something wrong with you.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.340]   We get excited about all sorts of things, don't we?
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.740]   Little successes, things that happen to us, things we hope are going to happen to us,
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:53.100]   things that might happen, things we want to happen, and all the excitement and the thrill
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.780]   of anticipation.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.740]   In people, we say we are Christian, that we are in Christ, that glory is awaiting us.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.220]   Where is the thrill and the excitement?
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.980]   Where is the thanksgiving and the prayers?
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.980]   The apostle is right, isn't he?
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.580]   Giving thanks always, always, always, never ceasing.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.660]   There must never be any intermission, perpetual.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:26.860]   But wait a minute, we must stir ourselves up, I say, to realize these things.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.900]   We must ask God to fill us with His Spirit.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.660]   We must avoid everything as we saw that grieves the Spirit.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.280]   And so being filled with the Spirit, we shall be aware of these things, constantly meditating
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   upon them.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:46.660]   And so we'll sing, "Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, who like Thee His praise should
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.660]   sing?"
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.940]   Praise Him, praise Him, praise the everlasting King.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.220]   But wait a moment, the apostle goes on to say this, "Not only giving thanks always,
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:04.180]   but for all things."
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.740]   Does this "all" really mean all?
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.100]   Of course it does.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.420]   It means everything, all things.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.900]   You see, you can't separate the "all" and the "always."
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.500]   If you're always giving thanks, you must have necessity to be giving thanks for all
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.680]   things.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.860]   And the apostle means it in detail and deliberately.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:33.900]   What says someone, "Am I to give thanks for trials, for troubles, for tribulations,
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   for infirmities?
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.100]   Am I to give thanks to God when things go wrong?"
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.460]   The answer is yes.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.300]   He not only says it here, he says it elsewhere.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:52.580]   He says in Romans 8, 28, "We know, we Christian people know, that all things"—now you
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:59.740]   mustn't put any limit on that, there is no limit on it—"we know that all things
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:05.660]   work together for good to them that love God, even to them who are called according to His
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.660]   purpose."
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.660]   We know it.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:13.340]   "All things"—I don't care what, put them all in, listen to him again in 1 Thessalonians
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:20.700]   5, 18, "in everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.100]   you."
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.980]   And then you notice the teaching of that portion of Hebrews 12 that we read together at the
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.820]   beginning.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.740]   "Give thanks even for chastening."
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.820]   James goes further and says in the second verse of his epistle, "My brethren, count
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.060]   it all joy when ye fall into divers trials."
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.380]   It's temptations in this authorised version, but it means trials.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.300]   "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers trials."
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.340]   It is something in which you should rejoice.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.420]   And the apostle Peter has exactly the same teaching.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.860]   In his first epistle and in the first chapter he puts it like this.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.520]   He says that we are kept by the power of God through faith and through salvation ready
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.180]   to be revealed in the last time.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:17.660]   Wherein he says, "Ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.220]   through many full temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.660]   of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.780]   honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ."
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.820]   Well, now then, here is the question.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.820]   How do we give thanks to God under such conditions?
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.740]   Well, let me suggest that we do it like this.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.180]   Let me take a notable New Testament illustration.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.900]   You will find an account in the sixteenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:57.660]   of a visit paid by Paul and his companion Silas to the town of Philippi.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.180]   All they were doing there was to preach the gospel.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.860]   They worked a miracle, they cast out an evil spirit out of a girl possessed with a spirit
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:10.020]   of divination, and for that they were arrested and shamefully entreated.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:15.140]   They were scourged, they were beaten upon their backs by sticks and cords, and then
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.580]   they were taken and thrown into a prison, put into the innermost prison with their feet
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.820]   made fast in the stocks.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.460]   You cannot imagine anything much worse than that, can you?
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:33.660]   But this is what I am told in verse twenty-five, "And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:42.100]   and sang praises unto God."
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.340]   I wonder what we would be doing if we had been there.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.620]   Wouldn't it be something like this?
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.220]   Paul and Silas grumbled and asked God what he was doing with them, why he was treating
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:57.660]   them like this, why they were his good servants, why he had this treatment, why is he thus
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.580]   unfair and unkind to them?
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:07.860]   No, no, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God, and we are told the prisoners heard
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   them.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.500]   At midnight, you see, they kept these other prisoners awake.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   Why?
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.620]   Well, they were thanking God to such an extent and singing with such loud voices that the
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.900]   other prisoners couldn't sleep.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.780]   They were kept awake.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:25.340]   And their feet fast in the stocks in the innermost prison.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.660]   How can one do this?
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.500]   Giving thanks always and for all things, and to God and the Father.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.660]   How do you do it?
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.660]   Well, this is the method.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.820]   I believe that this is the analysis of what Paul and Silas probably did unconsciously.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.340]   They were filled with the Spirit, you see, and the Spirit led them, and this is how it
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.340]   works.
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.620]   Though you may find yourself in adversity, as Paul and Silas did, though things may be
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.300]   going against you, what do you do?
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.020]   Instead of sitting down and saying, "Isn't it terrible?
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.020]   Isn't it awful?
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.020]   Why should this happen to me?"
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:02.740]   You say, "All right, I am in trouble, but I am a Christian still, and because I am a
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:08.060]   Christian still, I have been chosen of God before the foundation of the world, and God
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.740]   so loved me that he sent his only Son into the world to die for me.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.180]   He loved me and he gave himself for me.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.020]   So my feet are fast in the stocks, that is still true of me.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.300]   Well, thank God!"
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.340]   And then all the other things I have been saying about what God has done for the Christian,
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.780]   go through them one by one.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:31.780]   Count your blessings, name them one by one, and then you will begin to thank God.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.540]   Well, that is the first thing.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.300]   That remains in spite of my adversity.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.700]   Then here is another very wonderful and comforting thought which will make you thank God, though
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.660]   everything is going against you.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:48.860]   Listen to Peter putting it in his first epistle, chapter 4, and in verse 16.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:55.500]   He says, "First of all, if ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye."
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   You know you may be suffering this morning because you are a Christian.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.100]   The people of the world do not like the true Christian, and they try to get it out of him,
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.100]   as they put it.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.580]   "If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the Spirit of glory and
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.660]   of God resteth upon you; on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.940]   glorified.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.300]   But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil-doer or as a busy
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.980]   body in other men's matters.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:30.420]   Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, let him not be cast down,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:38.420]   let him not be unhappy, it means, but let him glorify God on this behalf, so that if
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.020]   things are going against you this morning, if you find that you are suffering simply
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:47.520]   because you are a Christian, well, far from being cast down, let him glorify God on this
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.520]   behalf.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.500]   It is a wonderful privilege you are having.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.540]   They are treating you as they treated your Lord and Master before you.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.100]   And do you know the moment you begin to think things like that, you are praising God.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.100]   You cannot stop it.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.500]   You are thanking God for his goodness to you.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.300]   But then go on to consider this.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.820]   When things have gone wrong or you find yourself in trouble, it is always a good thing to ask
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.820]   questions.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.100]   Do not grumble and complain and begin to go to God and say, "Why should this happen
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.300]   to me?" instead of that, "Ask this question."
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.860]   I wonder whether I needed this.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.500]   I wonder whether I stood in need of this.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.540]   Is this perhaps a bit of chastisement I am receiving from the hand of God?
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.460]   Now do not run away with the notion that I am saying that every illness or accident or
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.300]   everything that goes wrong is always chastisement.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:44.860]   I have just been saying it may be the enemies of God, but sometimes it is chastisement.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.940]   Quite definitely, illness included.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.980]   It is not always, but it can be.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:54.860]   You see, the psalmist in Psalm 119, verse 67, tells us this, "Before I was afflicted,
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.260]   I went astray."
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.420]   He was a good man.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.780]   He was a godly man.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.700]   But you see, he went astray.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.460]   So ask yourself the question, "I wonder whether I was beginning to get into a position
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.820]   in which I needed to be pulled up.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.660]   Was I beginning to go astray?
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:20.420]   I wonder whether this has happened to me because God is trying to keep me from sin.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.700]   I wonder whether I was on a pathway that might really lead me to terrible trouble, but that
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.260]   God in his goodness has interposed.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.460]   He has held me up.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:36.820]   He has prevented my going right to the end of where I might have landed."
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.300]   Ask yourself the question, "I wonder whether I have been tending to live a little bit independently
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.540]   of God.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.140]   Things have been going well with me.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   I have been blessed.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.500]   I have had abundance.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.420]   Nothing was lacking.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.260]   Have I been forgetting God?
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.620]   Have I been thanking him as much as I should?
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.420]   Have I been as regular in my duties as I should with respect to God?
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.340]   Have I been praising him?
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.380]   Have I been living unto him as I know I should be living?
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.540]   I wonder whether this has happened in order to pull me up and make me think and examine
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:14.020]   myself and remind myself of all these things.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:19.100]   Have I perhaps been tending to forget that after all I am but a pilgrim in this world,
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:26.400]   that I am a child of eternity, and that always I ought to be preparing myself for that which
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.460]   is coming to me as God's dear child?"
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.500]   You ask yourself those questions and you may well come to the conclusion that this is a
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.860]   bit of chastisement which God is giving you because he loves you.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.860]   Did you notice it?
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:44.180]   "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he calleth."
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:49.220]   If you are not receiving chastisement, you are bastards.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:55.740]   You know you ought to worry much more if things never go wrong than if they sometimes go wrong.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.060]   Chastisement is a sign that we are children of God.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.660]   And then it leads you to this.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:05.940]   It leads you to faith in God's fatherly love.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.140]   You say, "God is my father.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.420]   I don't understand what's happening to me now."
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.500]   But God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.820]   Behind a frowning providence he hides a father's face.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.180]   And the moment you arrive at all these conclusions, you begin to praise him and to thank him.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.140]   You say, "His love in times past forbids me to think.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.780]   He'll leave me at last in troubles to think."
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.780]   He can't.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.380]   He'd be denying his own eternal constancy.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.060]   He would be denying the fact that he is the father of lights with whom is no variableness,
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.380]   neither shadow of turning.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:52.140]   And so, you see, having reasoned it out, you come to this conclusion and to this position.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.540]   You not only don't complain, you are not only not content with your lot, but you even
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.140]   rejoice in it.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:07.980]   And you say, "Thy way, not mine, O Lord, however hard it be."
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.420]   There is nothing like knowing that you are in the hand of God.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   And it's better to know that you are in the hand of God when you are in trouble than to
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.620]   have everything going well without having this blessed assurance that you are in the
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.100]   center of his will and in the center of his hand.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:32.380]   You know, if you work out this argument, you will agree again with the psalmist in Psalm
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:43.140]   119 when he says in verse 71, "It was good for me that I have been afflicted, that I
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.780]   might learn thy statutes."
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.700]   Before I was afflicted, I went astray.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:57.020]   Therefore, he says, "It was good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:04.740]   thy statutes," in all things, giving thanks to God, always, whatever is happening, because
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:12.820]   it will lead you to this final conclusion, that you can be confident always in God.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:18.940]   David looking back across his life says, "I am old and I once was young, yet have I never
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:23.260]   seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread."
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:30.820]   If you are a child of God, God will never let you go.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.100]   He will perfect that which he has purposed concerning you.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.980]   Yes, he may chastise you.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.540]   He will chisel corners off you.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.380]   He will knock bits off you.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:44.020]   He will have you to be made conformable to the image of his dear Son.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.820]   And as you realize it is happening to you, though it is painful at the moment, as the
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:52.500]   author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it in the twelfth chapter, you know that afterwards
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.340]   it "yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness."
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:01.740]   So when you are full of aches and pains and are being pummeled in the gymnasium of God,
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:06.820]   you are thanking him, thanking him, and in a sense you say, "Go on with it.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.860]   Make me that which thou wouldest have me be."
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:15.020]   My last word is this, "How the thanks are to be given in the name of our Lord Jesus
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.020]   Christ."
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   Why?
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:21.620]   Well, because you cannot approach God except in his name and apart from him.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:26.300]   It is through him that all the blessings come to us.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:32.420]   But above all, it is through him that we become children of God.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.980]   God is God to everybody.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.220]   God is the God of the universe.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:44.500]   Yes, but you see, giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:52.220]   And God is my Father because, first of all, he is the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.660]   Jesus Christ.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.020]   He is Christ's Father.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.020]   Where do I come in?
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:04.180]   Well, I have been put into Christ, and because I am in him, God is my Father also.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.660]   He is not my Father apart from Christ.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.860]   It is in Christ I am saved.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:18.060]   It is in Christ I receive this adoption, that God makes me his child and I become a member
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.060]   of the very household of God.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.500]   Oh, the Apostle, he never can leave out this name.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.020]   He has been doing it right through the epistle.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:32.580]   Whether you pray, whether you give thanks, whatever it is, it must always be in the name
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:38.700]   of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:48.660]   Shame on us Christian people that we ask so much and thank so little, that we are so
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.020]   ready to grumble and so slow to praise.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:58.060]   Oh, our need is the need of being filled with the Spirit, because when we are filled with
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:03.860]   the Spirit, he does enlighten and open the eyes of our understanding, and we see what
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:09.100]   is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:15.460]   and the exceeding greatness of his power to us that believe.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:21.340]   He leads us to the scriptures, to meditation, to consideration, and as we realize these
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:31.140]   things, our hearts will be bursting with a desire to thank and to praise God, giving
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:43.260]   thanks unto God and the Father, always and for all things, in the name of our Lord and
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.460]   Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.500]   Amen.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.420]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
