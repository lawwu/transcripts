[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   - Why is it important for people to realize that
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.960]   while they might be investing in the longterm,
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.020]   they don't live longterm?
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.200]   - I saw that part of that quote from Daniel Kahneman,
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.020]   who recently passed away and he spent his whole career
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.880]   studying human foibles and human behavior and emotions.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.360]   And when he gave his Nobel Prize speech,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.480]   someone asked him like,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.320]   why can't more people stay the course for the long run?
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.760]   He said, the long run is not where life is lived, right?
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.840]   It's a series of short runs.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.600]   We were talking to a client a couple months ago
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.080]   who worked at Lehman Brothers.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200]   This person is making a lot of money working on Wall Street.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.340]   They have the ability to take a lot of risk.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040]   But this person realized,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.560]   I don't care what that ability is,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   what the spreadsheet tells me.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.080]   I can't physically or mentally make myself do that.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.560]   So I wanna take a more conservative route with my portfolio
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.360]   regardless of what the results are gonna be.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.820]   I know my results would be better
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.860]   if I could invest more aggressively,
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.900]   but I have this mental block that's holding me back.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.640]   And actually, I think that's the right decision
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480]   as long as you don't take it too far.
