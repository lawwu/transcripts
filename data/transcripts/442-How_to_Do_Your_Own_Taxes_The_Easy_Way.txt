[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.640]   That means that we are one weekend closer to the best time of year.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.840]   The best month.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   April.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.880]   And April 15th slash this year, it's April 18th.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.920]   April is upon us and that means...
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.560]   It's tax time!
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:21.280]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.360]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I am your host and your fellow taxpayer.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.040]   Today, let me give you some tips on how to do your taxes the easy way.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.760]   And also try to answer that question of should you hire an accountant or do it yourself?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:49.360]   As we begin here, I must confess that I generally don't feel as excited about April
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.040]   as I sounded there in the little intro.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.800]   But I do try very hard to be that excited.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.000]   I often get very grumpy when it comes to the subject of taxes.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   I get very grumpy.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.640]   My politics and my political ideology make me very grumpy about paying taxes.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.240]   I get very grumpy about what the money is used for.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.840]   I can't stand the way that, in my opinion, it's wasted and just causes me to feel very grumpy.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.320]   But I've also found that grumpiness is not generally a pleasant emotion.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.000]   And since I've chosen to do it, I try to focus on the â€“ meaning I've chosen to
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.120]   live in the United States of America and live where I live.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.960]   Well, that comes with the territory.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.760]   And so I try to approach it with the very most positive mindset that I can.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.720]   And I try not to be grumpy.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.480]   Years ago, I remember listening to Jim Rohn tapes and he would talk about how when he
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.040]   started paying taxes, the tax rates were 90 percent.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.000]   And his mentor, a man named Earl Shoff, would â€“ coached him to stop complaining about
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.560]   taxes and appreciate the fact that he made money and that the goal is make a lot of money
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.680]   and pay a lot more taxes.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.240]   I found that type of advice very easy to listen to and much harder to actually feel.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.400]   So I do believe that it's good not to be that grumpy and not to be all upset about it.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.280]   I don't think that just because you try to have a good attitude doesn't mean that
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.760]   you can't wish to see things change or work to see things change.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.640]   But I do often feel this deep internal tension between trying to have a positive attitude
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.940]   and a general sense of unhappiness when it comes to tax time.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.080]   So if that filters into today's show, now you know why.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.680]   But I'm determined we're going to do this with a positive mindset.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.360]   I'm going to walk you through this.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.600]   And the question that I want to answer with today's show is just simply if you were
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   a friend of mine and you were saying, "Joshua, how should I actually do my taxes?
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.320]   I've never really done taxes before.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.640]   Should I go and hire an accountant?
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.240]   Should I go to a tax place on the corner?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.520]   What should I actually do?"
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.960]   That's the question that I'm trying to answer.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.320]   We're not unfortunately going to be talking about tax strategy because unfortunately for
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.480]   you it's too late.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.200]   March or April is not the time to be doing tax strategy.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.120]   Once you close out the calendar year, once you arrive at January 1, your tax planning
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.320]   is basically done.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   About the only decision that you can make when you're actually in the process of filing
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.520]   your taxes that's going to make a difference to your tax rate is whether or not you make
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:25.240]   contributions to certain tax qualified accounts such as an IRA or a Roth IRA, perhaps a health
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.160]   savings account, or if you're self-employed whether you make something like a SEP IRA
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   contribution.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.080]   Those decisions can be made and those contributions can be made up until the tax filing date.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.880]   The deadline, usually April 15.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:47.120]   But if you have not done that, but other than that, your choices pretty much close out on
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.560]   January 1.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.640]   So we can't do a lot of tax planning or tax strategy.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.380]   But what I can do is give you some guidance on how to approach just the nut of actually
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.260]   doing your taxes.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.400]   We got to begin though with the things that are common to all.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.440]   Many people want to go and hire people to help them with their taxes because they don't
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.440]   know where to start.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.040]   I'll tell you where to start and that's with your records.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.320]   The most important thing that will impact how pleasant or unpleasant your tax filing
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.480]   experience is, is the quality of your financial record keeping.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.180]   And this will impact it no matter the course of action you choose.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.540]   If you walk into your accountant's office and you drop down the proverbial shoebox full
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.220]   of receipts, guess what?
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.060]   You're going to have a big accountant bill and you're not going to have a great tax return
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.320]   because your record keeping system stinks.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.620]   On the other hand, if you have a good end of the year report that shows your profit
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.020]   and your loss, shows the categories of your income and the categories of your expenses,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.740]   you can sit down with a manual 1040, you could probably have your taxes done in a half day's
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.660]   work, even if you had to calculate everything manually, even if you were running a business.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.280]   It all is a matter of your record keeping.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.620]   If you're an employee, you're not really going to have much record keeping.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.820]   If you just simply have a W-2, maybe a couple of W-2 incomes in the household, then even
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.780]   that is negligible.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.300]   But if you have any kind of side business, the single biggest thing that's going to matter
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.340]   is the quality of your record keeping.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.700]   You can approach your record keeping in many different ways.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.380]   There are many fine accounting systems and pieces of accounting software that you can
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.120]   use that are built for business bookkeeping.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.700]   There are many fine personal finance systems that you can use that will run your personal
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.860]   household bookkeeping and that you can adapt to run your business.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.640]   This last year, I've used sponsor of the show, YNAB, You Need a Budget, the You Need a Budget
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.260]   budgeting software system.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260]   I've used that all this last year.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.860]   I started before 2016, but I had a good year, an entire year of perfect records in YNAB.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.780]   I think that was the first year I had an entire complete year and I wasn't splicing that together
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.500]   with my spreadsheets.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.860]   Taxes are pretty simple because I had all of my income there.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.100]   It was all categorized.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.940]   I just spit out some reports from my business budget.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.300]   I had all my expenses allocated there.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.100]   I adjusted the report slightly to make it simple to put in and I was able just to take
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.260]   that and slide that data over into TurboTax.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.580]   That's what I use this year is TurboTax.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.060]   We'll get to that in just a moment as far as tax programs.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.500]   The biggest favor that you can do yourself and your accountant is to have excellent record
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.620]   keeping.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:56.380]   If your situation is simple as in you have a household and maybe you have a small side
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.780]   business or two or even a primary business, but it's just you and it's relatively small.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.740]   You don't have a lot of employees, things like that.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:09.140]   In that case, I recommend you just keep a very simple accounting system.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.820]   All of you, as I have done many times, do a quick ad for YNAB, all of you should be
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.500]   using or should have at least tried the YNAB budgeting software.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.260]   It works and does phenomenally well.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.500]   YNAB is the best budgeting software that I know of for you to use for your personal household
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.180]   because it allows you to adjust your budget and actually do that magic thing that budgets
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.460]   can do of deciding where the money is going to go.

[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.540]   You can do that and you can use a system like YNAB or you can use a system like QuickBooks.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.220]   QuickBooks is kind of the leading accounting software.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.380]   It's probably overkill for many of you in your simple side businesses.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.380]   I like QuickBooks.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.540]   I don't find it that easy to use.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.780]   I think that for many people, it's just more of a hassle.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:14.740]   If you're in a simple situation, you should be using probably those solutions, YNAB or
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.500]   perhaps Quicken, perhaps Microsoft Money, perhaps even Mint.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.060]   You could do this with Mint.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.820]   Tiller, if you were a spreadsheet kind of person but you're not â€“ if you're a money
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.220]   nerd and you're using Tiller, you probably already figured this out.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.220]   That works great.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.500]   If you have a more complex system, you should be using a bookkeeper.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.180]   If you're a business owner and you have a bigger business than that, you should have
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.900]   a bookkeeper, somebody who's responsible for keeping these records for you.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.060]   It's just not a productive use of your time to be spending time in the bookkeeping.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.340]   You need to keep an eye on it.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.660]   But the actual reconciling of accounts and things like that, that is best hired out.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.940]   So hopefully you have good records.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.860]   If not, you need to construct them.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.740]   Now you have good records or you have some records and you're trying to figure out,
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.740]   what do I do?
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.100]   Well, you have a couple of options.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:12.440]   The first option is you can do your taxes yourself with some kind of manual system such
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:19.220]   as downloading a Form 1040 from the internet or going down to the library and using a Form
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.420]   1040 to do your taxes yourself.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.780]   You can do that.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:31.300]   And if you have the simplest of situations, I think that actually works pretty well.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.420]   By simplest of situations, again, you have no businesses.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.500]   You just have a â€“ you have no businesses.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.940]   You just have a W-2 income or a couple of W-2 incomes.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.100]   You can sit down and you can work through a Form 1040 pretty simply.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.820]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.660]   You may even be able to qualify and use a 1040 easy, some of you, which makes it pretty
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.980]   simple.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:57.380]   In that case, you'll be able to have an option that is completely free and it will
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:04.220]   be relatively simple and you'll learn something while you're working through the worksheets.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.740]   Many people have done this for many years.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:14.340]   If your income is below about $64,000 as the cutoff this year, I don't know why you would
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.800]   do it manually except that you just enjoy the process of it because if your income is
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:26.980]   below $64,000, you can use some of the tax software for free.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.700]   There are a bunch of options.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:36.940]   The best thing to do is to start on the IRS website and look for the free file options.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.780]   On the IRS website, they've set up various relationships, business relationships with
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.700]   some of the different tax accounting software packages.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.220]   For example, there's Free Tax USA.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.700]   There is 1040 Now.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.220]   There's TurboTax.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.020]   There is Tax Act.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.780]   There's H&R Blocks Free File.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.580]   If you meet the qualifications, which are generally your adjusted gross income is under
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.580]   about $60,000 and generally if your age range is, you're younger than 52 years old, you
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.260]   can use their software.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.860]   I think the software is really frankly, just to get right to it, is my favorite solution.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.740]   It's what I have done for many years is just simply use the software systems.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.840]   The very best thing about the software systems is for somebody who's intimidated by a form
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.740]   like the 1040 with rows of numbers and all these tiny little print, et cetera, it breaks
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.540]   it down into a simple step-by-step approach.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.580]   You read a sentence, one question, and you choose from the answers.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.940]   You click and you go on to the next one.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.780]   As long as you just simply take your time, read the questions carefully, it's pretty
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.660]   hard to screw up.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.100]   The only thing that's a hassle, which is why I started with records, is if you don't have
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.180]   the records for the information.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:55.940]   If you have the records for the information, it makes it pretty simple to use.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.180]   The software packages will guarantee your mathematical accuracy and they'll help to
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   make sure that you don't miss anything.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.860]   They'll help to make sure that you don't miss filling something in.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.100]   They'll check for errors and they'll do a pretty good job.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:16.220]   I have never had any complaints with TurboTax and I've used TurboTax for many, many years.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.300]   I've never had any complaints.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.500]   They've just done a great job.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:30.020]   That is my recommendation, is for most of you to use one of the software programs.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:36.140]   If you don't use â€“ ways to do it, try the free version if you make under $60,000 per
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.140]   year.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.660]   If you make over that, then there are other options.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.120]   A listener in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group just asked about the new Credit
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.820]   Karma tax software system.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.860]   Credit Karma is the website that I've recommended for using to work on improving your credit
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.300]   score.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.980]   Credit Karma, C-R-E-D-I-T-K-A-R-M-A.com.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.220]   What they do is you put your information in there.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:06.100]   They scrape the data from your return and they give you hints and suggestions and an
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.160]   estimate of your credit score.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.140]   Then what they do is â€“ the way they make their money is they market to you products
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.500]   and services such as a new credit card, a new bank, a new investment account, etc. that
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:25.140]   they think will help you to save money or do something.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.260]   Then they get paid a commission if you click on that.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.660]   So it's free to use and Credit Karma gets a commission if you use their website.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.740]   Now just this year, they started offering Credit Karma Tax which is a software system
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:45.460]   to provide and help you do your taxes.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:52.260]   They offer support for the 1040 and they also will offer support for a 1040 Schedule C which
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.900]   is for sole proprietorship, a Schedule E, partnerships, estates, trusts, S-corporations,
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.500]   C-corporations and Schedule SE, self-employment.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.780]   So they will offer those three schedules and support for those.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.820]   They bill their services entirely for free.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.540]   So if you're over $64,000, it's worth checking them out.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.860]   They evidently according to â€“ I've never tried them.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:17.820]   I had just checked into them and I just read their FAQs and they have exactly the same
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.780]   business model where they will seek to market to you products, financial products that they
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.700]   think are helpful to you and if you do that, they will be paid a commission.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.420]   So the tax software systems are really, really good.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.500]   If you want to try them, that's fine.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.820]   They're untested, read some reviews, try it out.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.140]   It's not going to cost you anything.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.020]   You're just going to be giving up some of your privacy.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.820]   Another thing that you can do is what I have done is just buy TurboTax for example at Costco.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.820]   That's what I did this year.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.260]   I bought it on discount at Costco and you buy it every year.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.660]   It has that year's forms and is updated and it works out.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.020]   It's cheaper than it was to do it online.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.660]   So that would be my recommendation.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.820]   Now do you need an accountant?
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.020]   This is a hard question to answer because of course it's always it depends.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.140]   But here's who I think it depends on.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.180]   If you're a complex business owner and you are filing multiple returns, you're filing
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:19.100]   partnership returns, corporate returns, you're filing those types of things, I think you
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.940]   would get benefit out of the accountant just simply to lessen some of that work off of
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.940]   yourself.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.020]   In general, that's probably good business to farm out to somebody else, to become a
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:34.580]   real expert with tax is going to take you a significant amount of time and that's time
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:40.420]   that you're not doing spending building top line revenue, building and making more of
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.420]   a profit.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:47.540]   It's also going to take you â€“ you're probably also going to miss a number of simple deductions
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.660]   and unique creative strategies that an accountant could be able to advise you on.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.620]   So if you're a business owner, in general, I would probably steer you towards working
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.540]   with an accountant.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:03.620]   The challenge is that for individuals, an accountant really can't do much planning
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.700]   for you.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.260]   If you're a W-2 income earner, an accountant can't really help you all that much with
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.820]   it especially when it comes to returns.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:20.820]   Many accounting practices even from a local accountant simply take the data entry and
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.500]   give that to a junior person and have a junior person do the data entry, do the return and
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.940]   the accountant just takes a quick look at it before it's sent back to you.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.020]   Much of the time, you're generally not getting much consultation and this is where I want
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.260]   to break down the difference between getting a return versus consultation.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:46.060]   A software program like a TurboTax is excellent for doing your return.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:52.540]   It's useless for giving you a consultation, a proactive consultation.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.940]   It's really not worth anything at all.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.260]   But an accountant can give you a consultation.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:07.920]   So many times, it could be worth it for you to approach it in the context of I'm paying
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.500]   for consultation and advice, not just for the doing of a return.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.460]   The challenge is with that, I can't give it a blanket recommendation and here's why.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.220]   One, most people can't do much.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:27.900]   Again, if you are a median income, W2 income earner, you can't â€“ there's not â€“ putting
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.940]   money in your 401(k) is about it.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.940]   That's about all you got.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.180]   There's nothing more that you can do.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.620]   If you start to get into investment property, if you start to get into business, if your
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.060]   income starts getting higher, then you have options.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.260]   But for just an average income earner, filing a W2, an accountant can't do anything for
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.260]   you.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260]   Most people are just going to take the standard deduction.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.380]   You're not even â€“ just the whole hassle of going through and filling out all the itemization
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.460]   is generally a waste of time.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.500]   It's worth doing it I guess just to see if you qualify.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.660]   But very few people do.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.820]   Most people just take the standard deduction and you're done.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.320]   So there's not a lot of options there.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.800]   So if you're all in that situation, you should just simply use tax software.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.380]   The other problem is finding an accountant who will actually give you proactive advice.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.220]   In my experience, I found this to be harder than I think it should be.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.000]   After trying to work with a few different accountants, I found that many people would
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.740]   just simply do my return for me.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   But it was much harder to find someone that would do proactive planning.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.420]   Now part of that may have been due to my income.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.840]   I wasn't earning half a million dollars a year and I wasn't willing to pay the fees.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.580]   But I even tried some of the high-priced â€“ I worked at a couple of high-priced accountants
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.260]   as clients of mine.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.940]   I would try to get them to help me.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:55.060]   So that brings me now to kind of the final option which would be not so much an independent
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.380]   accountant but more of a tax preparation firm like an H&R Block.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.300]   I don't have any problem with an H&R Block.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.060]   I think they do fine work.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:10.140]   I don't see a ton of value for you as listeners going to somebody like that.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:16.060]   I think that if you're going to go and work with a tax preparer, look to find a local
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.100]   accountant, perhaps a CPA, perhaps an enrolled agent.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.620]   But look to find somebody who can provide that real proactive advice.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.460]   I think if you're looking at just simply having somebody do it, if you have good records,
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.060]   you're better off going through it, the software yourself because you'll learn more with the
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:39.020]   software yourself versus having somebody at a large tax preparation firm just do it for
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.020]   you.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.620]   And if you need advice, go to an accounting firm.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:49.240]   So my least favorite option is one of the large things, the people you see advertising
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.680]   on the corner or a large brand name with loads and loads of accountants in there.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   They have plenty of business.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   Lots of people use it.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.180]   But for you, the discerning radical personal finance listener, I don't see a ton of value
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.180]   there.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.840]   I'd rather you work with somebody who could take the time to go and give you advice.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.220]   Don't forget about the volunteer income tax assistance program, the VITA program from
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.220]   the IRS.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:23.100]   The IRS brings in volunteers who will sit down and provide some free basic income tax
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:28.140]   preparation for you if you make under about $54,000 per year.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.900]   Look on the IRS website and you'll find options at irs.gov.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.140]   You'll find options for the VITA, the volunteer income tax assistance program.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.820]   And if you're under that situation of under $54,000, I think that would also be a good
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.820]   option.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.820]   It will save you money.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.760]   I like to save people money.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.500]   Now in closing, here's what I would recommend you do for next year.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.680]   It's March.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.100]   If you're finding yourself caught in the grip of madness, of tax madness, recognize the
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.780]   problem and commit yourself to making it different next year.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.660]   If that means you need to hire a bookkeeper, hire a bookkeeper.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.760]   The cost of a good bookkeeper is not going to be very much in terms of the time that
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.800]   it frees you up if you're a business owner, high income owner, the time that it frees
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.160]   you up to be able to pursue other things.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.780]   And you need to have those good records.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.860]   If you have fought for the last year and you weren't maintaining a transaction record of
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.700]   every single one of your transactions kept up to date, it's time to look into hiring
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.800]   a bookkeeper.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   Don't fool yourself.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.980]   Stop trying to convince yourself you're going to change.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   You're obviously not.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.140]   You haven't changed thus far, so you're obviously not going to change in the future.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.740]   Hire somebody.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.940]   And if that ticks you off because I said you're obviously not going to change, then let that
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.380]   anger cause you to go and change.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.300]   But you can hire a bookkeeper very, very inexpensively.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.660]   And take your tax return, however you get it done this year, and then next month give
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.820]   the accountants time to get through, wait till May.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.820]   Let them get through April.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.220]   Let them get through the busyness and the craziness.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:06.900]   Middle of May, schedule an appointment with an accountant in your area for a consultation.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.100]   And take into that meeting your tax return, a couple of previous years' tax returns if
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:18.460]   you can, and also take in with you your profit and loss statement for your business.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:25.740]   And have them look at those pieces of data and try to give some proactive advice.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.460]   Because right in the middle of the year, June, May, June of 2017, that's a great time to
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.140]   do tax planning because you got six months left.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.140]   And that's when you can make a difference.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:44.780]   It's too late for last year, but you're right on time for this next year.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.780]   Try out a tax program.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.780]   Remember, you can get it for free using the IRS Free File System.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.540]   You can get help from a volunteer income tax preparation person.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.940]   And make sure you have good records.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.140]   And next year, your experience can be very different.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.060]   I know this is short and to the point.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:09.220]   If you have questions that have been raised, go ahead and come on by today's show at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.300]   Put those questions in the comments.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.620]   I'll hang out there in the comments on today's show and do my best to give you some answers
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.620]   on this.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.500]   I know this is timely content and the tax deadline is piling up.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.020]   So come on by and do that.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.860]   Thank you to several new patrons who have subscribed to the show in the last few days.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.860]   Huge huge benefit.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.180]   And I thank you for your patronage.

[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.800]   That's very very helpful as it allows me to keep you, the listening audience, as my primary
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.380]   focus in the work that I do rather than leaning so heavily on advertisers for all of the revenue
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.380]   from the show.
