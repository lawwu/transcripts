[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:14.100]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.940]   where every week I'm unpleasantly surprised
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.580]   because we get new questions
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.700]   that we haven't thought of before.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.260]   Got a few this week.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.620]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.420]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.020]   Bird Dogs, some of the most comfortable clothes that I have.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.220]   I started with the shorts.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.740]   I have a bunch of those.
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.700]   A couple weeks ago doing the laundry,
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.820]   my wife said, "Did you really wear
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.540]   "all these Bird Dog shorts this weekend?"
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.020]   I said, "Yes, I was active."
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.700]   I was outside, I was running around, working out,
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.940]   playing with the kids.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.180]   I used a lot of them.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.020]   Now we're going to fall.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.460]   We have the sweatpants,
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.660]   the khaki pants that are stretch.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.300]   You have the polo shirts.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.140]   It's great.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.580]   And if you go to birddogs.com/atc,
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.780]   Ask the Compound, of course,
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.180]   you get a free white tech dad hat,
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.940]   which I think I wore on the show a couple weeks ago.
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.780]   - You did.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.820]   You looked like a tennis player.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.900]   - Yeah, I wore a promo coat.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.100]   Yeah, I look like I'd be in the U.S. Open.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.940]   It's ATC.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.980]   You get one of these really spiffy white hats.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.820]   Duncan, I still got one for you.
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.460]   I have to bring it to Future Proof for you.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.780]   - Oh, awesome, cool.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.540]   Yeah, I'm expecting to see a ton
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.620]   of Bird Dogs gear at Future Proof,
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.700]   so looking forward to it. - Yes, yes.
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.460]   All right, let's do first question.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.860]   - Okay.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.180]   Up first today, we have,
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180]   "My job is to run a concentrated 20-company portfolio,
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.260]   "all listed companies, buy and hold,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.240]   "long-term horizon, et cetera.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.900]   "I get a base salary and a bonus for performance,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.820]   "so a good amount of my annual earnings
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.580]   "are tied to the performance of the companies I pick.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.460]   "I also have a small personal investment account.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.200]   "My question is about how I should think
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.040]   "about investing this.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.900]   "Should I use the fact that I spend all day
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.960]   "or all my time researching companies
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   "and invest in those companies for myself,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.700]   "or should I avoid the concentration risk
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.340]   "and go for a passive strategy?"
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.460]   - I love questions like this because--
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.580]   - This is cool, I like this, yeah.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.380]   - There's a compelling argument either way.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.400]   So on the one hand, yes, it makes sense
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.620]   for you to practice what you preach
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.220]   or have skin in the game or you cook or whatever.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.160]   Like, why should your clients have faith in your strategy
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.460]   if you don't have some money invested alongside of them?
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.860]   On the other hand, if you do have all of your money invested
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.820]   in this one strategy,
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.380]   you're doubling down on concentration risk.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.460]   It's where you get your paycheck from,
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.020]   your bonus, all this stuff.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.220]   So it's like not only a career
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.340]   and earning potential tied up in it,
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.020]   but if the strategy does bad, then it's double whammy.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.080]   So I actually decided to look at what this was like.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.040]   So I talked to Morningstar's Jeff Patak,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.300]   who ran the numbers for me.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.540]   And he says there's 10,300-ish mutual funds and ETFs
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.780]   in the United States that are listed.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.420]   More than 5,900 have portfolio managers
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.640]   that have no shares in the funds that they manage, okay?
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.200]   So that's the other 4,300 have at least
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.940]   one portfolio manager who's listed,
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.080]   has some shares that they own.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.780]   What this means is that close to 60% of all funds,
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.680]   the portfolio managers who are managing the funds
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.480]   have not one cent invested in their own fund.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.880]   Now, I guess you could make an argument,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   well, they could be money market funds or bond funds
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   or other kinds of funds that they just don't.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.880]   But I mean, I'm not saying you have to have
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.760]   your entire net worth invested in your own strategy,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.920]   but I mean, it'd be nice if you had some skin in the game.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.840]   Right?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.340]   I heard this story about a quant manager one time
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.440]   who runs a well-known quant hedge fund.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.600]   And he keeps his entire portfolio
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.640]   in like the Jack Bogle Total Stock Market Index Fund.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.480]   And the reasoning was his whole livelihood
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.820]   is tied up in quantitative funds,
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.460]   and he has an ownership stake
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.780]   in the investment firm he's part of, so he was diversifying.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.800]   And I think that makes sense from a careerist perspective,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.360]   but I think it's also a little hypocritical
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.000]   if you're not investing right alongside your clients.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.020]   There are ways that this could go wrong, of course.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.040]   There was a long, short hedge fund manager
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.120]   that my old endowment fund was invested in
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   during the 2008 crisis, and I think they did okay.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.360]   Okay at that time was like,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.400]   you basically matched a 60/40 portfolio in the downturn.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.140]   But he was talking about how he's seeing
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.800]   like generational opportunities to buy stocks
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.900]   based on his discounted whatever models.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.560]   And, but he couldn't really get himself to go all in
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.400]   and just go crazy with these stocks
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   because he wanted to be more defensive
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.300]   in case the financial system really did implode.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.320]   And one of the reasons he gave for this
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.240]   is because he said he had his entire liquid net worth
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.180]   invested right alongside his clients.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.580]   So it was almost like he was more preserving
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.280]   his own personal capital than worrying about
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.460]   how to invest on behalf of the clients.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.140]   And so I think this can also go wrong
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.540]   as a careerist on steroids there.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.200]   So do I think you have to have all your money invested
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.760]   in this concentrated portfolio of stocks
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.980]   that also pays your salary and bonus?
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.020]   No, but do I think you should have some of your money
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.980]   invested in this strategy?
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.340]   Definitely, right?
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.100]   And I think if you're recommending clients
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.140]   put most of their net worth in it,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.940]   then you probably should have a lot of money too.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.260]   But if you're recommending, listen,
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.100]   this is a nice sleeve of a portfolio
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.420]   that can diversify you,
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.900]   then why don't you have the same stance, obviously, right?
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.300]   So obviously everyone has different risk profile
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.120]   and time horizon,
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.220]   but I like the idea of practicing what you preach.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.380]   Personally, I invest the majority of my liquid net worth
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.740]   in the same funds and strategies
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.400]   that our clients invest in.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.540]   I do have some other investments for justification purposes,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.820]   but the majority of that money is invested
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.800]   right alongside how clients would invest it
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.020]   if I was in their shoes.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.820]   Obviously, we have a bigger focus on financial planning
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.860]   and asset allocation here
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.480]   than a concentrated stock portfolio,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.420]   but yeah, if I was one of your clients,
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.100]   I would want you to have some money in the strategy.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.460]   You can diversify, of course,
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.780]   but I want some of that money invested in there
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.740]   right alongside me.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.460]   - Yeah, it kind of reminds me of seeing insider ownership
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.580]   in public companies.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.620]   It's kind of nice, yeah.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.940]   Nice to see that there's some alignment there.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.140]   - Yeah, you want some, put some skin in the game.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.340]   And I just want to,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.740]   if we hear some banging in the background,
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.780]   there was a huge flood in my building.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.260]   - I was going to ask you to explain, yeah.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.180]   - Like a week ago.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.900]   I was Forrest Gump and Bubba with the shrimp boat.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.360]   All the other shrimp boats around me got destroyed.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.260]   My office was like the only one that was untouched.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.900]   So they're demolishing the whole rest of the floor around me
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.980]   and fixing it and tearing out stuff.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.940]   And I'm sitting here just in my office,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.940]   just pretending like nothing's going on.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.180]   - Do people in the building resent you?
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.100]   - Probably.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.260]   I mean, there's no one else.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260]   On this wing, I'm the only one left.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.060]   So I made it.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.420]   All right, next question.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.260]   Yep.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.060]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Timothy.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.620]   With the rise in bond yields,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.200]   when does it make sense to sell out of long-term,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.620]   at a long-term, out of a long-term bond fund at a loss
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.860]   and buy short bonds?
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.940]   For example, something like a short-term treasury fund.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.300]   - All right, we've been talking for a while now
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.260]   about losses in bond funds,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.340]   especially at the long end of the curve.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.980]   TLT is the 20 plus year treasury fund.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.660]   That's 40% off the highs.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.820]   Even if you weren't that long,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.820]   they don't really specify here how long they are.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.980]   IEF is like the seven to 10 year treasury fund.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.740]   That's down 20%.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.080]   We're still in a bear market in bonds,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.300]   which not a lot of people talk about.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.440]   If there's a bear market in stocks,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.140]   people are talking about it.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.580]   The bond market doesn't get as much attention.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.780]   So I don't know how long-term you went,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.220]   but let's say you were in like a very long-term bond fund.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.060]   TLT, the average yield of maturity now is 4.5%.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.260]   So if we're doing a back of the envelope,
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260]   how long is it gonna take you to make up for that 40% loss?
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.060]   We're talking, I don't know, nine years or so
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.960]   based on current interest rate levels.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.420]   IEF has an average yield of maturity of 4.3%.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.140]   So we're talking at least four to five years
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.360]   to break even on that 20% loss.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.640]   The good news is at least you can sell
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.880]   for tax purposes right now, right?
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.060]   You can tax loss harvest any of those losses
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.760]   if it's in a taxable account.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.420]   Start with a clean slate.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.380]   But I do think that there's a huge conundrum
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.500]   if you are sitting in these massive losses
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.340]   in long-term bonds,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.260]   because what if we go into recession
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.140]   or the Fed pulls off a soft landing and rates fall
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.460]   and the Fed cuts rates, right?
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.940]   So the effective duration on TLT is 17 years.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.300]   That's one of the reasons it got killed so bad.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.740]   So what this means is that a 1% move in interest rates
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.840]   would effectively mean a 17% move in prices.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.500]   So rates rise 1%, TLT falls 17% in price.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.740]   You could net that out a little bit
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.580]   with the yield if you wanted to.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.920]   - Like a meme stock.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.140]   - It is, that's why it's down 40%, right?
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.320]   But if rates fall 1%, guess what?
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.060]   You're missing out on a 17% gain.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.380]   So I think this is one of the reasons,
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.020]   and this is of course one of the reasons
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.300]   that a lot of investors have loved long-term bonds
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.000]   for so long, is because anytime the stock market fell
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.100]   and the Fed cut rates,
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.080]   these things were a wonderful hedge against the stock market,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.540]   but they are very volatile.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.040]   Like coming out of 2009, they lost a ton of money.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.100]   So I think you're in a tough position.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.200]   I did write a piece this week about what would happen
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.100]   if you simply swapped out bonds,
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.720]   intermediate term or long-term for just T-bills
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.560]   and held cash.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.920]   So John pulled the first chart.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.460]   The results were actually closer than I expected.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.540]   So this is an 80/20 portfolio,
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.700]   one with a 10-year treasury
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.420]   and one with a three-month T-bill.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.020]   So it's 80/20 in bonds versus 80/20 in cash.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.380]   And these are rolling 10-year returns since 1928.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.260]   You can see they're pretty close.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.420]   John, do the next one.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.560]   This is 60/40 portfolio using five-year treasuries
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.140]   or one-month T-bills.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.400]   And the bond portfolios do better,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.260]   but it's closer than you would think.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.380]   So if you wanna make that switch,
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.940]   now is the time to do it with a clean slate.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.940]   Especially in a taxable account, you can harvest some losses.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.540]   But my biggest worry here would be psychological.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.060]   If like, I think you have to ask yourself,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.780]   if rates rose 1% and long-term bonds got killed again,
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.840]   man, I'd be kicking myself.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.740]   But if rates fell and long-term bonds took off
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.500]   and they were up 15 or 20%,
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.380]   how mad would you be at yourself?
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.340]   So I think this is kind of a tricky situation.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.540]   And so I think, yes, harvesting some of those losses
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.600]   is like the easy thing to do,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.580]   but I don't know about locking in the losses.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.460]   So I'm almost gonna punt in this question and say,
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.620]   it's really difficult to know what to do
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.660]   because the long-term bond thing
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.960]   is you're locking in some huge losses here.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.280]   Any thoughts, Duncan?
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.460]   - No, I mean, you know,
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.220]   I don't mess around with bonds very much.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.620]   - I guess the question you have to ask yourself is this.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.400]   I've personally never liked investing in long-term bonds
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.900]   because of that duration.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.560]   They're so volatile that I would rather accept my volatility
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   in the stock market
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.860]   because you're actually getting paid to accept it there.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.540]   Whereas in long-term bonds with these high duration levels
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.120]   and high maturity levels, it just never made sense to me.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.440]   Why would I wanna take that much risk in the bond fund?
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.020]   I prefer the barbell approach
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.960]   where you're taking way less risk in bonds
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.620]   and taking the volatility out of there as much as you can
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.620]   and accepting the volatility in stock.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.420]   So I think you have to ask yourself,
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.100]   you know, am I really okay accepting this much volatility?
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.600]   That's the question you have to ask
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.560]   because you could be giving up in some gains,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.080]   but you just have to be prepared for more losses as well.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.860]   - I know a lot of young and new investors
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.280]   were as confused as me back when the market
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.920]   started getting super volatile and dropping and gapping down
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.940]   and bonds were also going down.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.480]   'Cause yeah, like everything you always read historically,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.560]   or at least what I had always heard was,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.800]   oh, it's a hedge basically.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.960]   So when stocks go down,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.160]   bonds at least maintain or don't go down as much.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.760]   - Yeah, this time bonds caused it.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.480]   - Yeah, yeah, it was different.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.240]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.640]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Steve.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.920]   The state of the US economy
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.760]   seems very unclear at the moment.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.180]   It seems like you could twist the data
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.800]   to show anything from a hard landing to a soft landing
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.280]   to overheating or some other narrative.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.960]   I know these things are impossible to predict,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.880]   but what kind of framework do you use
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.960]   to think through the probabilities here?
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.420]   - This is like the Charlie Munger quote
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.280]   where if you're not confused, you're not paying attention.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.560]   I'm confused as well about the potential path forward.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.560]   So let's bring on one of the people
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.680]   who actually taught me to think in terms of probabilities,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.320]   Mr. Barry Ritholtz.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.160]   - Hey, Barry.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.000]   - Hey, guys.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.720]   - Barry, I've heard you kind of go through
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.520]   the different potential paths here
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.300]   where a soft landing or a hard landing
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.520]   or a no landing, whatever it is.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.620]   It does seem like every couple of weeks
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.160]   the narrative changes between like,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.440]   oh, the economy's too hot
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.400]   or the job market is slowing down now
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.560]   or rates are going too high or rates are falling again.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.600]   How do you try to think through this
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.360]   in terms of where we are and what the trends are showing?
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.040]   - So first, I love this question.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   And I want to just tilt it slightly.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.500]   I want to just change the framing ever so slightly.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.560]   The economy seems uncertain now, unclear,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.440]   but when is it ever crystal clear?
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.160]   Most of the time, someone's on the other side of your trade.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.080]   If you're a seller, someone's a buyer.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.280]   So there's always two sides to the conversation.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.560]   Think back to these like major turning points
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.840]   where there was no uncertainty.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.320]   There was a consensus.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.620]   I remember, I'm a little older than you guys.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.480]   I remember late 1999, trees grew to the sky.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   Everything is great.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.280]   We're all going to make a ton of money.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.840]   And that was just before the next quarter
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.520]   when we started an 81% crash in the NASDAQ stocks.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.600]   Even when things should be obvious, it's still missed.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.560]   I remember the debate in the middle of 2008, right?
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.440]   History tells us we're in the middle of the worst recession
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.240]   since the Great Depression.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.800]   People still didn't think we were in a recession.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.960]   They were arguing it is a recession and isn't a recession.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.680]   So if you can't see the worst recession in real time,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.900]   how can you see like this sort of,
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.000]   well, the Fed's tightened a lot,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.840]   but the job market is good
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.480]   and people still have some cash left
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.800]   in their savings account.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.760]   Well, the funny thing is that last year,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.880]   people thought it was clear.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.320]   And the clarity then was,
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.760]   well, sure, 2023 is going to be a recession.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.920]   It's almost a lock.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.560]   And of course it didn't happen.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.840]   So even when you think things are,
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.480]   you know it's going to happen, we really, we don't.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.440]   That's right.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.560]   And here's the,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.400]   I like to say economists suffer from physics envy.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.080]   You know, astronomers can land a craft
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.780]   on an asteroid going 50,000 miles an hour,
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.880]   a hundred million miles away,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.780]   but economists can't predict a recession six months out.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.680]   In fact, it was next month, next month,
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.160]   next quarter, next quarter.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.480]   It was going on for three years.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.440]   So the first question is,
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.280]   the first part of the answer is simply,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.520]   we don't know, we almost never know in real time.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.280]   It was obvious during the pandemic
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.200]   when we shut everything down that it was a recession.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   Other than that, you don't know.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.640]   That may be the only obvious recession
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640]   that we've ever lived through really.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.480]   Right.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.960]   But more importantly, and I know Ben,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.680]   you've done a bunch of really interesting blog posts
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.960]   on this, even if you knew it was a recession, so what?
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.240]   The market tends to roll over before the recession starts.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.960]   It starts to recover before we declare
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.320]   the end of the recession.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.380]   You've talked about the lead and lag.
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.880]   Even if someone could whisper in your ear,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.760]   here's the date the recession begins.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.160]   Here's the date it ends.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.480]   Would that even help you as a trader?
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.840]   Right, yeah, you could get those news headlines
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.680]   and you wouldn't know.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.240]   John, throw my next table up here.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.160]   One of my favorite things is,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.680]   so this is every US recession going back
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.000]   to the Great Depression.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.520]   And what I found was that like 84% of the time
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.360]   we are not in a recession, meaning 16% of the time
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.120]   we have been over this past 100 years-ish.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.520]   And so I think your baseline is, guess what?
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.960]   Most of the time we're not going to be in a contraction.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.240]   So if you're predicting one every year,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.680]   it's not going to happen.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.240]   It's kind of like the stock market
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.680]   is that most of the time it goes up,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.760]   but sometimes it stuff hits the fan.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.280]   Think about that sweet reward when you get it right,
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.760]   when you get that call right, Ben.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.800]   But to Barry's point, the timing is really the key here.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.960]   Like we could be in a recession and if it's a mild one,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.800]   you might not know it until six months after the fact
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.200]   when they actually say, hey, by the way,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.240]   we looked at all these indicators
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.840]   and we actually were in a recession.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.160]   Sometimes you just don't know.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.800]   And for most people, the only time it really matters
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.080]   is are you losing your job or is your income impacted?
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.760]   And Ben, you've shown some charts
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.200]   that markets have gone up through mild recessions.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.440]   They never even slowed down.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.800]   They haven't gone down.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.960]   You're probably the guy that does the most
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.600]   with taking the data around recessions
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.720]   and market performance
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.080]   and putting it into really good context.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   Yeah, so the answer here probably is
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.560]   you're probably not going to be able to use
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.280]   the economic indicators to predict the market
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.840]   unless it's a really bad situation.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.040]   It's one of these 2008-type calamities.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.560]   That's probably the only time that can actually help you.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.280]   And Barry, to your credit,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.120]   you were one of the people
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.040]   who were kind of pounding the table on that one,
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.560]   but most people at the time missed that one,
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.040]   which is, I think, one of the reasons
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.680]   so many people have been predicting a recession
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.120]   every year since then, 'cause they missed it the first time.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.360]   You know, the thing that was so fascinating
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.240]   about the run-up to '08, '09
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   is that if you looked at all the traditional indicators
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.880]   of recession, things like the yield curve
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.920]   or job creation or what have you, it wasn't there.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.880]   You had to take a 30,000-foot view,
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.640]   look at what was going on in the post-dot-com collapse
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.480]   and say what normally follows the end
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.240]   of that sort of recession,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.560]   and recognize it wasn't the traditional recovery.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.480]   It was free money, it was low rates,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.400]   and it was a backwards housing-driven recovery.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.740]   And if you looked in the right place,
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.560]   it was like those 3D posters.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.720]   If you looked in the right place,
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.200]   you could see the dolphin jumping out of the water.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   - I can never see those.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.540]   I've never been able to see that.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.240]   - Same, I could never do the magic.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.080]   - Cross your eyes or back up, I can never do it.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.840]   - That's why you missed the '08, '09 recession,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.680]   if you had that ability and you could look at housing.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.760]   But by the way, I love when you see these long charts
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.000]   of here's a relationship between cost of ownership
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.960]   and cost of renting, and then suddenly it spikes,
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.280]   or median income to median home price.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.040]   And when you see these two and three sigma events
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.760]   where things are just orders of magnitude
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.800]   out of the ordinary, that's when you have to say,
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.760]   "Hey, something unusual is going on here."
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.600]   - Right, all right, Duncan, next question.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.240]   - One other thought, just from my perspective on that,
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.200]   being a non-financial professional,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.680]   I thought that there was a potential
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.360]   that everyone just saying, "Oh, recession's imminent,"
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.800]   was gonna actually kind of cause a recession, right?
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.280]   Because everyone was gonna cut back and get scared,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.440]   and it didn't really seem like it worked out that way.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.260]   - It's like a watch what they do,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.100]   not what they say kind of thing.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.520]   People were saying that, but no one was acting like it.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.040]   - You can't jawbone the American consumer down.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.200]   If they wanna go out and spend, they don't care,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   they're gonna go out and spend.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.520]   - Everyone says, "My neighbor's broke, but I'm fine."
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.820]   - Right. - And they keep spending.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.660]   - That's the difference
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.400]   between a recession and a depression.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.280]   A recession is when your neighbor loses a job,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.920]   a depression is when you lose your job.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.080]   - There you go. - Sounds right.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.480]   Okay, up next we have a question from Elliot.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.420]   - Hi, I'm a younger listener who loves following the channel
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.200]   and wanted to ask a common man question
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.780]   on behalf of those in their 20s and 30s.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.900]   Outside of regular 401(k) contributions,
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.780]   what if I can only afford to add 25 to $100
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.780]   to my Roth IRA every paycheck via direct deposit,
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.000]   and I want to go super long with my buys?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.320]   Can you share some advice around long-term investing
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.800]   for those who can barely contribute,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.920]   but still want to maintain regular contribution behavior?
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.640]   Is this where invest-in-what-you-know/see-around-you
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.960]   comes into play?
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.520]   I'll just say, I've been burned on investing
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.800]   in what I know with my early.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.040]   - Well, I think the idea here is that like,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.000]   I don't have a lot of money yet, I'm still young,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.400]   I'm building up my savings.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.840]   Should I do this super long thing where I take more risk
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.360]   to try to get to that point?
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.560]   And I think the idea of trying to get rich overnight,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   especially when you're young and you,
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.700]   you know, if you're saving a couple hundred bucks a month
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.840]   or something, it takes a while for that compounding
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.720]   to build up and show a big, you know,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.340]   show a huge change in your balance.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.440]   And so you think, well, I have to get there much faster.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.240]   And I think that's probably the problem
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.600]   that most people come to where,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.120]   and that's where you get some mistakes, I think.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.760]   I think you have to, I would take the super
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.720]   out of the equation.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.320]   Sure, go long, but I don't think you need to do something
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.680]   out of the ordinary and try to hit the cover off the ball
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.560]   just because you're not where you want to be yet.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.020]   And I would add, I love the idea of developing
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.180]   very good investment behaviors early.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.300]   It's like eating healthy food,
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.120]   going to the gym, running every day.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.780]   It doesn't matter how far you go
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.020]   or how much money you put into the market,
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.660]   but the habit of thinking long-term and saying,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.220]   I'm gonna pull just even a little bit of cash
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.740]   and put it to work every paycheck,
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.740]   that'll compound over time, not so much $25 at a time,
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.220]   but when you're in your 30s and 40s,
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.880]   and it's so habitual, and you are making 500
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.960]   or $5,000 contributions,
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.920]   that's when it really begins to add up.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.540]   But the behavior, the good habits,
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.660]   that's really a sharp insight from a young investor.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.480]   - Well, and that's the thing, at that age,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.920]   in your 20s and 30s, the biggest thing
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.960]   is your saving behavior, not your investing behavior.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   Right, the percentage gain on $10,000
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.760]   is obviously a lot different dollar value
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.280]   than percentage gain in a million.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.900]   My favorite one, there was a interview with Bezos one time,
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.940]   and he said, he actually got some investing advice
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.420]   from Warren Buffett, and Bezos effectively said,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.700]   "You've been so successful in your career
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.220]   "being a long-term investor, what's the secret?
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.920]   "How come people just don't copy what you do?"
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.700]   And he said, "No one wants to get rich slow."
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.340]   And that's the idea, is when you're young, especially,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.840]   just keep saving and investing and slowly work up
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.740]   and save more as your career progresses
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.820]   and you make more money,
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.260]   but don't try to get there in a hurry
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.100]   because that's probably when you're gonna make mistakes
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.540]   and you're gonna get in your own way.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.420]   And the flip side of that is,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.460]   if you're engaging in that saving behavior,
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.500]   it also means you're living within your means.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.140]   You're not overspending, you're not buying flashy whatever
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.340]   just to show off, whatever you're doing,
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.700]   if you're putting money into a savings
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.100]   or an investing account,
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.780]   it means that you have a pretty well-balanced budget
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.760]   and you're managing your money well.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.460]   Right, and if you wanna have a speculative account
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.820]   that's 5% or 10% of your portfolio,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.740]   knock yourself out and go after penny stocks
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.020]   or whatever you wanna speculate on,
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.360]   but then leave the other stuff alone
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.980]   and keep putting money in on a regular basis.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.660]   - Do you think people typically get more risk-averse
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.100]   as they grow their wealth?
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.060]   Is that like a thing that they switch more to preserving
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.260]   what they have instead of trying to grow it?
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.700]   - Most people.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.900]   - I'm gonna give you a weird answer to this,
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.260]   which was a blog post I did a couple of months ago.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.180]   In the early part of my career, when my 401k was tiny
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.540]   and I had very little money at risk,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.700]   every market crash was like the every pullback,
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.420]   every 20% was a freakout.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.220]   And it seemed like it mattered a lot
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.220]   when the impact on my assets didn't make much of a difference
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.660]   because there was too little money for 20% of very little
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.340]   is still very little.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.700]   Later in life, as my 401k grew and my assets grew
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.140]   and my portfolios grew,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.800]   hey, I've now lived through the dot-com implosion,
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.500]   the financial crisis, COVID,
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.500]   and where it actually has a genuine impact on your assets,
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.900]   it matters much less because after you've seen this movie
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.540]   enough times, it's like, yeah, this too shall pass.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.300]   It's cyclical, it's a buying opportunity
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.700]   when you're down 20, 30, 40%,
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.660]   and it'll come back, it always does.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.220]   So it's kind of odd when it matters so little,
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.660]   it really feels like it's the end of the world.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.580]   And when it's real money at work,
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.340]   it's kind of like, eh, it's not that you're not risk averse,
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.780]   it's just, hey, I know how this movie ends.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.880]   - Well, Barry, you've posted a lot
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.020]   about the death of equity story in 1979.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.180]   If you read the actual story,
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.220]   it says, and they're kind of making fun of them,
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.540]   it says the only people who are still investing in stocks
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.860]   and putting money in are people who are like 60 and over.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.420]   And it was like everyone under 60
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.020]   is giving up on stocks except for them.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.780]   And it was kind of poking fun at them.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.660]   But guess what?
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.340]   It's because they'd been through a number of cycles
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.240]   and they realized like, okay,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.280]   this is a good thing to be putting money in
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.740]   when the markets are bad
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.020]   and everyone else has given up that's younger.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.220]   And that was the problem.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.640]   - Who has the last laugh?
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.900]   You know, you've mentioned the book "The Money Game"
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.740]   by Adam Smith in the past.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.100]   And he tells a story in that book
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.620]   about a fund manager who hires all these young hotshots
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.940]   to run, run and gun.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.100]   And Smith asked the guy,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.880]   why are you hiring these young guys?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.580]   He goes, 'cause they have the nerve
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.420]   to buy all the crap that I won't touch,
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.120]   but then I'll fire them after it crashes
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.340]   and then I'll go in and buy it cheap.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.340]   'Cause he's seen the cycle.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.740]   Listen, it never changes.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.600]   The names change, but you go back and you read
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.020]   about telegraphs and railroad and steel
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.700]   and cars and televisions and radio.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.700]   It's the same story as crypto and fiber and AI.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.580]   Human nature doesn't change.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.300]   So the cycles are always the same.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.660]   It's just what the specific object of desire is.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.460]   Maybe it's ETH or maybe it's radio.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.380]   It doesn't matter.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.340]   It's the people around it, that's the same.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.580]   - Yep, I'll do another one.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.260]   I'll do another one that's kind of similar actually.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.380]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.100]   Up next, we have a question from Kevin.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.580]   Aside from my retirement accounts,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.700]   the vast majority of which is in index funds,
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.820]   I have a brokerage account
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.660]   that's invested in individual stocks.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.540]   Not to brag, but what began as a garden variety
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.140]   percentage of my portfolio, about 5%,
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.100]   has now grown to 16%.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.460]   As a little aside here, I'm just gonna say,
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.500]   I really appreciate all these inside jokes
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.220]   that we have a huge viewership and listenership
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.720]   that gets these and makes this a lot more fun.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.340]   Two stocks account for almost 45% of this account,
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.220]   Spotify and Nvidia.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.780]   I've heard differing opinions about what I should do.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.640]   Cut the weeds and water the grass or trim profits
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.860]   so I'm not so overly concentrated.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.220]   In the first case, I'd only be getting more overweight
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.140]   in these two positions.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.180]   And in the second, I might lower my exposure
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.620]   to these winners in order to buy under performers.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.180]   I won't need this money anytime soon
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.500]   and plan to keep it invested.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.860]   Should I trim the large positions
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.980]   and buy a broad market index fund to bring the 16%
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.580]   down to a more manageable number?
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.480]   What would you do?
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.380]   - The psychology going on here is like,
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.700]   we know gains can be fleeting in individual stocks,
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.780]   but I also don't wanna sell the next Amazon or Apple
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.300]   too early and miss out on further gains.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.460]   So John, throw up a chart here I got of Nvidia.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.680]   This is Nvidia, so I'm guessing this is part of the reason
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.480]   that it's growing to be such a big part of your portfolio
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.020]   'cause Nvidia has just knocked the cover off the ball.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.660]   But Nvidia has experienced in the last five years alone,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.260]   a 36% correction in 2020, it was down 56% in 2018,
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.240]   which a lot of people forget about.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.700]   Last year alone, it was in a 66% drawdown.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.680]   So same with Spotify, in the last three years
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.000]   have been drawdowns of 40%, 36% and 80%.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.780]   So I think the simplest thing to, I can't tell you like,
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.460]   you should sell this stock or buy this stock
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.480]   because who knows with these things.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.540]   But I think you basically create a threshold on this account
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.820]   where this is what we told the last person is like,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.660]   you want a speculative account, that's fine.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.540]   Figure out a number that you want because these stocks
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.080]   are gonna go way above and way below.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.480]   So if it's 10% or 15% or whatever, figure out, let's see,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.700]   when it gets to 12 and a half percent,
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.540]   I'm gonna trim a little bit.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.740]   When it gets to seven and a half percent,
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.580]   I'm gonna buy some more.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.160]   So I would just put some sort of bands around it.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.140]   So you give yourself some rebalancing
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.880]   and occasionally you take those gains
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.700]   off the table yourself and you balance,
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.140]   pre-balance back into the pain as well.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.940]   - I had a buddy from grad school,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.120]   I may have told this story before on the show,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.800]   but it's perfectly fits the scenario.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.340]   He started at a new firm, they eventually get bought
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.920]   by Yahoo in the mid 90s and by the time his stock vests,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.940]   it's just immense and oversized,
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.640]   way over 45% of his portfolio.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.480]   And when he asked me, what the hell do I do,
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.640]   rather than talk about performance or alpha
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   or how much gains there were to be had,
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.240]   I gave him the regret minimization framework,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.120]   which is simply, hey, if you sell this here
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.440]   and it keeps going, how do you feel?
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.700]   And then the flip side is if you don't sell
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.200]   either of those here and they collapse, how do you feel?
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.420]   Sometimes it's really clear, with Yahoo it was clear,
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.500]   he 35% of his stock vested.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.980]   If he sold and it kept going, he didn't care,
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.620]   so he still had 65% of his options.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.860]   So he had the easy decision.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.820]   Sometimes it's a toss-up and when you have
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.740]   a toss-up situation, occasionally the right answer
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.660]   is split the baby, sell half.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.340]   If it keeps going, hey, you still participate,
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.180]   but you've locked in some real gains,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.640]   especially, we're talking percentages,
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.660]   but we don't know if this is a $100,000 account
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.620]   or a $10 million account.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.180]   There have been occasions where you see
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.420]   these one or two stocks.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.260]   We just met with a prospect the other night
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.300]   where their Apple and Amazon from 2000
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.980]   is 98% of their individual stock portfolio.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.100]   That's a lot of individual stock risk.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.220]   So if you're not sure which way to go,
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.220]   if either way the stocks go don't give you a decision,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.520]   sell half, take a little off the table.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.320]   If it collapses, hey, thank goodness,
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.780]   you took something off the table.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.440]   If it keeps going, you still participate.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.840]   Remember, as an investor, your goal is never to,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.040]   you're not generating alpha,
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.160]   you're not writing a shareholder letter
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.340]   explaining why you sold the big winner.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.080]   You wanna be able to sleep at night
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.320]   and own stocks towards a goal,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.760]   which is a comfortable retirement
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.600]   or whatever it happens to be.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.640]   - That's the point, no one's gonna dock you any points
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.160]   if you sold 50% too early, right?
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.500]   There's no points for complexity
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.460]   or degree of difficulty or whatever it is.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.940]   If you locked in some profits on a huge winner,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.340]   like you won the game kind of, that's good for you.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.940]   You should pat yourself on the back.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.540]   No one times these things perfectly
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.940]   and sells right at the top.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.300]   - Especially if it's enough money
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.180]   that it can change your standard of living.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.660]   If it pays off your student loans,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.100]   if it pays for your house,
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.340]   if it pays for your kid's college,
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.860]   hey, that's a huge win.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.400]   The idea is not to die with the most money.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.640]   The idea is to enjoy life
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.520]   and not be stressing constantly
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.840]   about what's going on with Nvidia or Apple
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.880]   or whatever the stock of the day happens to be.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.720]   - That's the other thing.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.880]   These stocks, if they get to a big enough piece
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.280]   of your portfolio, that's great, you won,
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.600]   but the stress level it could have on you,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.280]   we're watching on a tick-by-tick basis
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.200]   and living or dying by it, that's no way to live either.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.740]   - Yeah, it goes back to the guy
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.820]   who's an investment professional.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.660]   I've heard this from so many people,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.900]   people who manage billions and billions of dollars
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.140]   and their personal account is $100,000 of play money
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.980]   and they check the personal account three times a day
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.160]   and they check in on their portfolio,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.100]   the billion dollar portfolio once a week
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.940]   'cause they're not gonna make changes every day
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.700]   in the billion dollar portfolio
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.340]   and the tick-by-tick $100,000 account,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.580]   it's just fun for them.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.620]   And sometimes we kinda forget what's what.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.080]   - Yeah, well said.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.440]   Okay, I think that's it for today.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.080]   Thanks to Barry.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.760]   Thanks to everyone who hopped on the live chat,
