[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets, and
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   today I would like to talk to you about a second housing-related idea that I have changed
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   my mind on. Previously on Radical Personal Finance, I shared with you how I've changed
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   my mind about the value of a vacation home. Specifically, I have come to appreciate that
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   there are benefits of a vacation home that I didn't understand when I was younger that
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I now understand more clearly. And I see why many people, especially wealthy people, want
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   to maintain a vacation home. I always was focused on the downsides of a vacation home,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   the hassle of caring for a home and having someone come out and fix the septic system
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and the frustration and the annoyance of having to go to the same place every year when I'd
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   like to go ahead and go to a new place this year, etc. But how I've come to recognize
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   that actually having a vacation home is a big benefit. You can invite your friends and
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   say, "Come to the lake house this weekend and enjoy more time with your friends," or
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   your children have a spot where they can invite their friends to come out for a great weekend
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   on the lake. And by having a bunch of activities for them, then now they feel confident enough
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   to be leaders in a social circle, and that can just be great for their social life and
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   enhance their friend network and have deeper relationships, etc. It's just wonderful.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And so I've talked about how I now appreciate things I didn't appreciate. Now, here's
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   a corollary of that that I've also come to appreciate, and that is the topic of simply
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   having multiple homes. Now, those multiple homes could be vacation homes, but in this
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   context, I don't want to restrict them to vacation homes. These concepts are clearly
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   related, but I want to talk about some things I didn't discuss in the vacation home episode.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Similar to how I used to think about vacation homes as a hassle, I also used to think about
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   having multiple homes as a hassle. Most of the time, people who have just multiple homes,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   they generally tend to be on the wealthier end of the scale. But when I was younger,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I didn't understand why a wealthy person would want the multiple homes. Part of it
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   would be, of course, as a smug financial planner, you always read stories about, "Well,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   so-and-so went broke when they had six estates around the world." And you think, "Of
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   course they went broke, because they had six estates around the world." And you feel
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   quite smug and self-righteous about it. "If they were working with me, I would have
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   told them to be frugal, and of course, they wouldn't have spent all their money that
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   they earned." There's some truth to that, of course. But I always just thought, "Why
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   would you want to have six homes?" Again, why not just go and stay at the Four Seasons?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Why not go and stay at a five-star hotel and be in a different place? After all, you
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   don't have to commit to going to the same place every year. After all, what's that?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Why would you do it? I've spent time at some pretty cool resort places. I'm from
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Palm Beach, Florida, which is one of the big resort towns. We have a major seasonal
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   population. I've, here and there, hobnobbed with the elite of the elite. Over at the
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Everglades Club, having dinner with your friends at the Everglades Club on the
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   island, looking around and I'm thinking, "Here I am. I'm at the poshest of the
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   clubs, having the nicest of events, and okay, this is fine, but why is this, why?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Why do this? Why go back and forth like this? Why have a home in New York and a
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   home in Palm Beach? After all, isn't that a hassle to set your life up in such a way
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   where you have to go between them? And then what about your friends in each places,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and what about your children's appointments, and blah, blah, blah, and all the stuff?"
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And so I always thought, "What a hassle. I don't want to have multiple homes that
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I have to supervise." Again, a little anecdote I shared at the beginning of the
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   previous episode where I talked about the rich guy having to go and take care of his
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   home and his whole weekend is ruined fixing up the second home. But over the years,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I've wrestled a lot with where to live. And this is not something that I expected.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Three years ago, four years ago, I did not expect to be wrestling with where to live
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   because I was from one place and I lived a very stable life in that one place and I
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   was happy in that one place and I had a clear vision for the future. And so of course,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   that one place was fine. And so I thought, "Okay, the standard living model plus a
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   vacation is the right model. And why would you want to have multiple homes?"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I understand more now than I did back then. And what's interesting is I have found
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   it very difficult to figure out where I want to live in the world. And my wife has
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   found it very difficult to figure out where does Joshua want to live in the world
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   because for years of my life, I had a dream and the dream was very simple.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I wanted to be able to make my living from anywhere in the world. It took me 15 years
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to do it. It shouldn't have taken me 15 years, but it did. But once I did it,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I thought, "This is great. This is wonderful." And then I had to figure out,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   "Well, where do I live? What do I do? How do I do this?" And after all,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   if I'm going to have the perfect thing, I got to find the perfect thing.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I got to find the perfect place to live. And so you go on this intense search
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and you're like, "I'm going to find the perfect place to live." And for me,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I realized over time that I was giving up that concept. For example,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I've talked about this in the international space. One thing that brought me a lot
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   of personal freedom in my thinking in the international space was when I realized,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   "Listen, there is no perfect country. The United States of America is not
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   the perfect country. England, not the perfect country. Argentina,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   not the perfect country. Canada, not the perfect country. No country is the perfect country."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And it brought me incredible freedom through the concepts of flag theory
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and PT living when I just thought, "Just use each country for what they're best at."
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Want to drive really fast? Of course, you can go to a racetrack.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   But want to drive really fast? Then get a fast car and go drive in Germany,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   where the Germans consider it their birthright to drive as fast as they want to
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   on the unrestricted parts of the Autobahn. Want to go gamble and sleep with prostitutes?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Go to Costa Rica. Want to go and hobnob with the poshest of the posh and hang out
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   on your yacht? Well, go to Monaco. Go to Dubai. Just pick each place
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and don't try to make a place what it's not. Want to go and hang out in your beautiful vineyard?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Go to Argentina. Go to Chile. Go to another place and choose a place that has what you want.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Want wildly loud individual freedom? Go to the United States of America.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Want absolutely enforced mask mandates and vaccination and everyone? Go to a country where they have that.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Whatever the issues are, you can have a lot more peace in your life if you just go to a place
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   where that's there. And so from the internationalization space, it made sense to me.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And so I thought, "Well, I'll put my money in the place where my money is the safest,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   where they have the best banks. I'll do my investments where they have the best investments.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I'll get my citizenship from where I'm the freest and where I'm left alone, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But what about where to live? Where do I live?" And over the years, I've watched things change
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   for various people. And you start looking at places. And what happens is when you open up
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   the whole world to yourself of where you live, it's a little overwhelming.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Because generally as humans, we live in a place for usually one of three reasons.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Reason number one, that's where we were born and that's where we were raised.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Sometimes not the same thing, but that's where we're from.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You say, "Where are you from?" "I'm from West Palm Beach, Florida." Or, "I'm from Detroit."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So a lot of times, we just live there. Now, in the United States, it's less common,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   but most people around the world live in a place simply because that's where they're from.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That's who they are. They live in that village. They don't travel beyond the local area.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So that's where they're from. Of course, in the United States, we're much more restless.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   We tend to move a lot across the country. But of course, most Americans don't consider
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   living outside of the country. But within the country, there's tremendous options available
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and we tend to move a lot. But this is where I'm from.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Second reason is this is where my family is. So frequently, you find yourself wanting
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   to move close to family. You find yourself wanting to say, "How can I be close to mom and dad?"
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "How can I be close to grandpa?" "How can I be close to my grandchildren?"
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   "This is where my girlfriend lives," or "my boyfriend lives."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   These are very good and compelling reasons to choose a place to live because the people that are there.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   My friends, right? This is where my friends are. This is where the people that I click with are.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Very good reasons to choose to be in a certain place. It's for the people.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   In fact, I think this is generally the biggest reason. I find the more I travel, that although I can
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   appreciate certain things about different locations, the thing that I most care about in a place
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   is who the people are. Are the people that I love in this place?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And the third reason why we move is because this is where my job is.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I'm living in a little town, a little coal town in Pennsylvania. All the jobs disappeared.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Well, I'm going to go to where I can get a job. And I think that's a fine reason.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   If you need to move for a job, totally fine. But what if you take those things away?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   What if you're choosing not to live where you're from?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   What if you're not intentionally choosing to live where your family is?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   What if you are not making your money in a specific geographic location?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Well, now literally the world is available to you.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And I thought, "Oh, this will be great. After all, I've achieved my goal. I can live anywhere in the world.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   This is going to be wonderful." And I have found it utterly overwhelming, completely and totally overwhelming.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And it's like, it's too much. You think about, you know, there are times where it's just too much.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Someone is a glutton, right? It shouldn't be possible for us to have as much rich food available to us as possible.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   It's why historically many rich kings died of gluttony, because just too much.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   We're not meant to handle it. And in some cases it has felt that way with regard to freedom.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It's like, "Oh, this is too much. How am I supposed to choose this?"
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And what happens is you can get into this intense analysis.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And after all, you've got to make the best decision.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So what's the place that I'm going to live? Where am I going to live where it's the best?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And you're managing all these factors.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Well, I know these people here. Here's where my family is. Here are the people I love.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I really like the gun laws in the United States, but I don't like the cultural arguments with people.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I really like the cohesive culture in this other place, but I can't have so-and-so.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I mean, I could give silly arguments, but the point is that you look at it and it's a lot.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And it leads to a paralysis of analysis, or at least it can and it has in many cases been for me.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I go around and around and around. I'm like, "Well, look." I tell my wife.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I'm like, "Look, this place has this, this, this, this. We can get A, B, C, D, E that we like.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   But it doesn't have this, these things over here and this and that."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And I want to tell you that if you've ever been in that situation, trying to figure out what's the perfect place,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   number one, there is no perfect place.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And so you're just going to choose the place that you think is the best or at least the best for now.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But additionally, one of the things you can do is simply say, "What if I don't choose one place?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   What if I choose two places?"
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And the mental freedom that can come with simply saying, "I'm going to choose two places or more,"
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   can be really profound because there are many things that you can like about a place
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   for a certain amount of time and then you get tired of it.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   The example that I give is the Florida sunshine. I grew up in Florida.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   My favorite days growing up were always days that were cold and gray and rainy.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And I love those days because they always made me feel cozy.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And they're few and far between when you live in South Florida.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Now, having grown up in South Florida, I don't appreciate sunshine because that's all it is.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   If you come from Northern Michigan, all of a sudden now, or Quebec, we're in season now in Florida.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And so you see all the Quebec license plates and the Ontario license plates and the giant influx of snowbirds from Canada come down.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   You notice them the most.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And so if you're from Quebec, then being able to have sunshine in the winter is phenomenal.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   But here's the flip side.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   In Florida, you don't get any of the benefits of a white Christmas.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   You don't get to enjoy watching the snowfall on Christmas Day.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   You don't get to enjoy listening to the songs about sleigh bells ring.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Are you listening? Because there ain't no sleigh bells.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And so you don't ever get that sense of it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Whereas you can get that sense of it in a very different way, in a more northerly climb.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   So what if you have them both?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Then you can choose both.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   What if you have a home in the north and a home in the south?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Well, if you're really into having a cold Thanksgiving, maybe even a white Thanksgiving or a white Christmas,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   then you might choose to say, "We're going to enjoy staying at our home in the north.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   We're going to enjoy a white Christmas.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And then on New Year's Day, we're going to be on the beach in Florida where it's 70 degrees and sunny."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Because we don't want to go through the cold and dreary gray of January and February, etc.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Or you might say, "I personally don't have a four-season wife.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   She doesn't have any interest in becoming a four-season woman."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And so that annoys me.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   I'm like, "Pete, look, we can go skiing."
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   She's like, "All right, let's just go skiing.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   We don't need to live in the frozen north.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Let's just go skiing in the frozen north."
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And so you might have your ski cabin.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And you go and you spend a couple of months there or a whole month there or whatever it is at your mountain cabin
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and going to ski slopes, etc.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And you retreat back to the sunny south and you go to your place on the beach in Mexico.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Now, you can expand this beyond different lifestyles, beyond, right?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   You might enjoy certain aspects of the big city hustle and bustle.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I always enjoy traveling to a big city.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I enjoy going to New York City at Christmastime and doing all the big city stuff.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I enjoy that.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   But I may not enjoy it every day.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And so you might want to have a place out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   The point is that if you open your mind and you say, "What two places could we have?"
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   that could for you provide a major opportunity, a way to live a better lifestyle.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And that's what I now understand that I didn't understand about wealthy people,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   is that it is very common that wealthy people will have multiple homes.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And they do it because they like multiple places and they want to have homes in those places.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I don't have anything more profound to say than that.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   It's pretty simple.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You think, "Well, Josh, you should have recognized that years ago."
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But I was always so focused on the downsides that I hadn't arrived at a place in my life
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   where I appreciated the upsides.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   But I found this oftentimes with people.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   If you're struggling with consulting clients, and I have been able, using this new experience,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I have been able to ask better questions.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   See, I believe in a win-win lifestyle.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   This, of course, comes from Robert Covey's habit from Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   where he talked about win-win or no deal.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And for me, it's a very big principle that I'm committed to.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And his phrasing of that that I learned when I was a teenager was,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "Always go for win-win or no deal."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   The idea being that if we come to a transaction and we come to an agreement where you feel like you win
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   but I go away feeling like I lose, that is not an enduring agreement.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Meanwhile, if we come to an agreement where you lose and I win, that's also not an enduring agreement.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Obviously, a lose-lose is also not an enduring agreement,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   where both of us feel like we're losing is not an enduring agreement.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And so what Covey said is you have to search for win-win arrangements,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   which means that you need to not compromise but rather build consensus.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And so, especially in your most intimate relationships,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   your business partner says, "I want our business to be in such and such a place."
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Your wife says, "I want us to live in such and such a way."
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   "I don't want to do that."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   You have to look and find either a win-win deal where both of you feel like you win
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   or you have to stay committed to say, "No deal. We're going to keep trying."
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   And this is hard. This is hard in many situations.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   It's not automatic, but you have to keep working at it until you can build consensus.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Compromise often leads to hard feelings. Not always.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Sometimes you can compromise on things that are just not important to you.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Frequently, "Where do you want to go for dinner?"
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   "Let's go for Chinese food."
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   "I don't want Chinese food. I got Italian food."
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   "Okay, I'll compromise."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   "I don't care about it. Let's go for Italian food."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   "That's fine."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   But if you don't like Italian food, don't compromise.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   You need to look for the third deal.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   "How about Brazilian?"
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   "All right, great. Let's do that."
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   You got to find the third option until you reach consensus where everyone is happy.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Compromise often makes people feel bad.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So when you're looking at where to live, oftentimes compromising and saying,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   "Well, I really want to be close to Mom and Dad."
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   "Yeah, but I don't want to live in California."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Or, "I really want to live in California."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   "Yeah, but it never gets any snow."
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Or versions of that.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And so many times the right solution is just going to be keep looking for a great third option.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   But what I want to tell you is when it comes to your housing and where to live,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   many times I think you're better off if you expand your ideas.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And you say, "What two places could satisfy us?"
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Or, "Could we live in both places?"
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And while I feel like this is blindingly obvious now,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I recognize that it was not always blindingly obvious to me in the past,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   and it may not be blindingly obvious to you.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So if you're thinking about where to live,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   what if you gave yourself two places to live or three places to live?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   That way you could have the best of both worlds.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Now obviously in order to do this, you either need to not depend on a specific location
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   for your constant income.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   The working model where you're expected to show up at an office,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   the same office or the same job site 250 days per year, this won't work.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   But if you generate your income remotely or you live off of your investments,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   this will work.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Or if you have some form of seasonal work, this can work.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And this will work. This does work.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Because now you can say, "You know what?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I do want my children to have a close relationship with their grandparents.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I do really want that."
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So tell you what, let's go ahead and buy a condo in the same community
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   where our parents are.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Or let's buy a little house down the street.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Or let's get a bigger house that we can kind of share, but not all the time.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So that way we can have that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   But I don't want to stay there all year.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Let's also have a second place that's very far away,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   that's very exotic, that has other benefits.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And while I could circle the globe giving you the advantages and disadvantages
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   of different places, I think I'll keep this simpler and just say,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   ask yourself that question.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   If you, as I, have spent a lot of time doing, talking with my wife, right?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   "Honey, what's important to you? Here's what's important to me."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   You're putting these things down.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And in some cases, my wife and I, like, I can't find the consensus.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   She values these things. I value these things.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   How do I solve this?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I want her to feel valued and appreciated and have all of the things solved.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And I also want to feel like all the things that are important to me are met.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I don't want to compromise.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   I don't want to just say, "You know what?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I'm just going to give up what I want to go with what you want."
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I think that's a recipe for bitterness.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Similarly, I don't want her to compromise.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I don't want to say, "Well, honey, I don't care what you say.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   We're just going to do what I want because, after all, I'm the one that cares."
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Both of these are bad. These are bad.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   So you're looking for it.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   But one of the things that we have struggled with is,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   "Well, where is that location that has everything?"
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's unlikely that one location is going to have everything.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   What I found very helpful is, "Okay, what if there were two?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   What two locations could we do, could we use?"
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Now, don't get scared of this financially.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And let me give you a couple of specific financial tips.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Let's say that you had two locations.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Let's say that you had two places that you were interested in.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   As I stated in the show on vacation homes,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I think we often sell our capacity short.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   For many people, being able to afford one home is such a challenge
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   that they can't quite wrap their mind around the idea of having two.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And then that same mindset can continue even after you are no longer living
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, month-to-month.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And yet, what's true is that you actually could afford two,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   especially if you were thoughtful about the kinds of things that you did.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So what might you do?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Number one, you might just simply structure your life in such a way
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   that you could simply have two places.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   You might do that with a vacation rental.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   You might set up an arrangement where every summer you rent the house
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   for three months in the town where your parents are
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   so that you can spend all summer together.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Or you might set up an arrangement where we always rent your cabin
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   in January and February so we can go skiing,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   and so you can do it in the form of a vacation rental.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And that can be a perfectly affordable thing,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   as long as there's some wiggle room in your budget.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   In addition, you can choose two places that are different.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You might have a primary place that is expensive,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   and then just simply choose a second place that's not so expensive.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Either the rental rates are much more modest
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   or the cost to purchase is much less significant.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   You might do this in a phased approach.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   You purchase one house, you pay that house for a period of time,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   pay your mortgage payment, and then after five years
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   you can go ahead and afford a second place.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Or after 15 years you've paid off your mortgage on the first place
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and you go ahead and buy the second place.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And you just do it intentionally and you go back and forth.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   You can often do this if you'll be willing to take
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   a different standard of living.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   So for example, my family is not well suited to condo living.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   It doesn't work for us. I've got a bunch of children,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   they're active, it just would be a nightmare to live in a condo
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   without a big backyard.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   But vacationing in a condo is fine, and so for a second home
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   it would be no problem for us to have a condo
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   because during that time you just simply live a different lifestyle
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   and it's a temporary thing.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   So you might have a primary property and a secondary property
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and they're just different types.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   You might also choose a more modest living
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   than you would otherwise be able to afford.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Frequently as our wealth grows, we'll upgrade our houses
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   to be more lavish and more ostentatious houses.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Totally fine, but sometimes that doesn't give a lot more joy.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   If you've got seven bedrooms and your family occupies three,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   having the four extra bedrooms isn't often that big of a deal.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But what you might do is you might keep your current three-bedroom house
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and instead of upgrading, you might buy a second three-bedroom house
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   in a secondary location that is going to give you a different lifestyle
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   and then go back and forth between them.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   What's especially interesting about this is if you make it part of
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   the diversity of your life or your children's lives.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Many people wouldn't find it all that attractive if you are--
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   all that attractive to have two houses close to each other.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   But if there's a big difference in your houses,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   you've got a house in New York and a house in Florida,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   a house in Quebec, a house in Florida.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   A big difference seasonally between those opens a lot of things up.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   You might have a big difference culturally.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   You've got a house in Nicaragua and a house in Florida.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   It's easy to fly back and forth between Nicaragua,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   but the cultural differences between these houses are really significant.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   There might be cross-continental much farther away.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   We love to spend the summer in Europe,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   and we really enjoy that kind of cosmopolitan European thing,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   but we also really enjoy the American thing.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Go ahead and instead of upgrading from a three-bedroom house
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   to a seven-bedroom house, just grab a three-bedroom house in both places.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Now you can start to enjoy those different things to a greater extent.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Of course, you can fill in more and more scenarios.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   This is how I think about Asia.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   It's like I like Asia, but I don't want to live in Asia full-time, I don't think,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   but I do like it.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   So how can I just spend part of my year in Asia
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   so that I get more of a sense of the culture,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   more of a sense of being there, more of a sense of the excitement
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   than is possible with a two-week vacation or even a two-week work trip,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   but without actually committing to 12 months a year I'm going to live in Asia,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I'm going to uproot everyone and go there.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And so you can move among them.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Now what's interesting, in addition, is if you're thoughtful about the places,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   this doesn't have to be a major problem, and it can actually be a big advantage.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I've thought a lot about this over the years,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   particularly within the guise of international planning.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   A friend, Andrew Henderson, who runs the Nomad Capitalist platform and business,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   he has coined the term "trifecta strategy" to describe his approach,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   which is basically having multiple homes.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   What has been interesting to me is I've often not been attracted to Andrew's lifestyle.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   It's often seemed like just too much moving around for me, especially with children.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   The trifecta lifestyle is basically, "Okay, let's choose three homes."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   So Andrew has a home in Asia, he has a home in Europe,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   and he has a home in South America and a couple other places mixed in.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And so we just go between our homes.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   This is really fascinating because it can, with careful planning,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   it can result in a very tax-efficient lifestyle
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   without being a long-term resident of any of three countries.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   You may be able--again, a lot of caveats here--
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   but you may be able to spend significant amounts of time in places
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   otherwise thought to be high tax.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   The example I use here is, well, what if you spent--
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   you know, you generally wouldn't want to become a Canadian tax resident
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   because you have high taxes,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   but you could spend three or four months a year in Canada.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You could spend three or four months a year in the United States.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You could spend three or four months a year in Mexico.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And that could be a great thing to do.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I've encouraged many people to do this.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Let's say that you're from a country that is relatively--
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   let's make it clean and simple.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   You're a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis that doesn't impose taxation
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   on its citizens of any kind,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and you have visas to the United States and to Canada, proper visas,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   which allow you to gain easy access for an extended period.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   You have a B-1, B-2 visa to the United States,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   gives you six months access.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   So in this situation, you may thoroughly enjoy spending four months
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   in the summer at a beautiful cabin in northern Ontario.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Then on the shoulder season, you may love going to your cosmopolitan apartment
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   in the middle of Mexico City.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And then you may also enjoy keeping an apartment in Miami
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and spending your winters in Miami.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   It could be a wonderful lifestyle, but by going between those three countries,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   you are avoiding your income tax--
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   you're avoiding them imposing any income tax obligations on you
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   because you're not a long-term resident of those places,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   violating their tax rules.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And so you could use the trifecta strategy as an elegant way
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   of avoiding any tax obligations,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   even though you're spending time in places that are traditionally higher tax.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And again, you can mix and match anything you want.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   You could love spending your summer in the south of France.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   France is not a tax-friendly place to live,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   but if you spend three or four months there in the summertime,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   that's not a problem, especially if you've minimized other ties with the country.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Each country requires a careful review of its laws
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   to make sure you're not violating the laws.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   What I find--but the problem is that I don't think anybody actually is going to--
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   especially any wealthy person--
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   nobody wants to have some government bureaucrat dictate their lifestyle.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And if you actually think about designing your lifestyle
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   around tax optimization, that's what you're doing.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You're letting a government bureaucrat dictate your lifestyle.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   It's not that you should ignore it, in my opinion,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   but the whole point of being rich is that you don't have to let other people
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   dictate your lifestyle. You can live how you live--how you want to live.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   So I don't think it works for most people,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   and most people should not do that kind of lifestyle just for tax planning.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I think it's an interesting thing to think about,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   but you shouldn't do it just for tax planning.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   So what could you do it, though?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   You could think about the places in terms of a lifestyle.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And here's where I think it's really fabulous
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   to consider multiple places and ask yourself,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   "Are there many places that I could like being?"
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Now, one of the better concepts that Andrew Henderson brings in
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   is he calls it his "global citizen sandwich."
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's kind of an awkward name, but let me describe what he uses it for.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   There can be many places in the world that you like to be,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   but they're not necessarily perfect for everything.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And so the example he uses, which I believe is ideal,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   would be the three countries of Cambodia, Malaysia, and Singapore.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   If you look at these countries, they're all very interesting countries,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   but they're interesting for different places.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And so what Andrew talks about is,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   how can you gain from a high-value place, such as Singapore,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   without the cost and the frustration of actually living there?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And so one of the things that he does that I think is a perfect example
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   is, "I'm going to choose to live in Malaysia.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Malaysia is a wonderful value for the money, wonderful place to be.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   I'm going to live in Malaysia.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   I'm going to bank in Singapore, store my money in Singapore,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and perhaps have some business connections to Singapore.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   But it's hard to get a great investment return in Singapore,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   also possibly hard in Malaysia.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But there's Cambodia, which is a frontier market,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   where I really can build a lot of value from the Cambodian economy
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   without actually living there.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   It might not be where I want to live, but I can invest there."
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And so if you go around the world thinking about this,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   especially in terms of geographic proximity,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   you may be able to find your own little corners of the world.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And you could say, "All right, maybe Malaysia, Singapore, and Cambodia
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   are not for me, but maybe Mexico, Miami, and Nicaragua are for me.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I may really enjoy living in Mexico.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I'll do my banking and financial management in Miami,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   and then I'll do my frontier market investing in Nicaragua or Honduras
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   or something like that."
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Or you can put in any number of these.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I really enjoy living in--I don't need to give you more examples.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   If you think strategically about what you're trying to get
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   and you don't try to put it all--force it all onto one place,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I think it can open up options to you.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And what I now understand that I didn't used to understand
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   is that wealthy people are usually buying and/or establishing
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   multiple homes because they like to spend time in those homes.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And I'm going to skip the whole commentary on how I've also learned
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   that even the nicest hotels and even the nicest Airbnbs and whatnot
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   is kind of a hassle.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's nicer to have your own home where everything is just set up how it is.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Maybe I'm getting old and crotchety, but I have crossed that point
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   where it is annoying.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I don't enjoy being in rented facilities all the time.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   So consider that.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It may provide an option for you.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   If you're frustrated with where to live, if you're frustrated with
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   where's the one place that my whole family can agree on,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   maybe dial down the intensity and say, "What would be the two places
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   that would represent things that we really value?"
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Or maybe even the three places that would represent things
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   that we really value.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And then could we build a plan to accomplish those things?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   I'm telling you, I think you probably could, especially if you just simply--
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   even if you had to or you chose to moderate your finances.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   You might have a perfectly reasonable middle-class home in one place
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and a wonderful little condo in the city or a little apartment in the city,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and then just a wonderful little beachside villa.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And if you are full-time in any one of them, you may want something
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   a little bit more, meaning a little bit more expensive.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   But for part-time, it's a wonderful scenario.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I hope that provides you with a useful question to ask yourself
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   to open up your opportunities.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Thank you so much.
