[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   If you were advising Lee Kuan Yew in the 60s with the advice you would likely give to a
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   developing country now, would Singapore have been even more successful than it ended up?
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.160]   Would it have been less successful?
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.960]   With Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, I mean, it's the wrong way around. I mean, I learned so much from
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.480]   him. So the fascinating thing about Lee Kuan Yew is he took three decisions, really three
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.040]   important decisions, right at the beginning for Singapore. Each one of them now seems obvious.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.080]   Each one at the time was deeply contested. Number one, he said, everyone's going to speak English
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.240]   in Singapore. Now there were lots of people who said to him at the time, no, no, we've been thrown
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.640]   out of Malaysia effectively. We're now a fledgling country, a city-state country. We need to have our
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.080]   own local language. You know, we need to be true to our roots and everything. He said, no, English is
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.200]   the language of the world and we're all going to speak English. That's what happens in Singapore.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.920]   Secondly, he said, we're going to get the best intellectual capital and management capital from
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.840]   wherever it exists in the world, and we're going to bring it to Singapore. Again, people said,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.520]   no, we should stand on our own two feet. You're also bringing in the British who we've got all
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.720]   these disputes with. He said, no, I'm going to bring in the best from wherever they are,
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.040]   and they're going to come to Singapore. Today, Singapore exports intellectual capital.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.400]   The third thing he did was he said, there's going to be no corruption. One of the ways we're going
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.680]   to do that is we're going to make sure our political leaders are well-paid, which the
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.200]   Singapore leaders are the best paid in the world by a factor of about 10 for the next person,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.840]   and there's going to be zero tolerance of corruption. Zero tolerance of corruption.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.160]   Those are the three decisions that were instrumental in building Singapore today.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.360]   You know, you could go to the UK right now or the US and fundamentally, if you had to narrow
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.480]   down the list of the three key priorities and what would somebody who was in power to do so,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.640]   what could they do to fix that? Do Western leaders, if Starmer is elected in the UK or
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.360]   whoever becomes president in the US, would they have the power to enact what the equivalent would
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.200]   be for their societies right now? Or is it just sort of like you have all this inertia, you can't
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   start fresh like Singapore could start in the 60s? No, you definitely can. I mean, the American
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.160]   system's different because it's a federal system. There's probably, in many ways, this good thing
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.320]   that there are limits to what the federal government can do in the US. But if you take
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.640]   the UK or most governments where there's a lot of power at the centre, I mean, what we've just been
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.400]   talking about, which is the technology revolution - how do you use it to transform healthcare,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.480]   education, the way government functions? How do you help educate the private sector as to how they
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.120]   can embrace AI in order to improve productivity? I mean, this is a huge agenda for a government
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.680]   and a really exciting one. I mean, I keep saying to people that were in politics today, because
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   sometimes people get a bit depressed about being in politics because you get all this criticism.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.160]   People certainly in the West feel society's not changing fast enough and well enough.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.600]   And I say, no, it's a really exciting time to be in politics because you've got this massive
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.320]   revolution that you've got to come to terms with.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.960]   [END]
