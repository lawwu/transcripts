[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Wednesday. Thanks for listening.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   While I love finding sermons where Pastor John proclaims the God-centeredness of God,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   there are a lot of those sermons, and rightly so.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   This is the cornerstone of what we call Christian hedonism.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   God is thrilled with himself.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And without this point, Christian hedonism wouldn't make any sense.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And without this point, the gospel wouldn't make any sense either.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   To make this gospel connection, I recently came across the following sermon clip.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   It's from a conference message that Pastor John delivered in Massachusetts back in the fall of 1992,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   over 30 years ago now.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   In this clip, Pastor John is setting the table for the doctrine of justification,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and he's setting the table with the doctrine of God.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Here's how he did it.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   One of the reasons that it's hard to get a whole range of biblical doctrines across to Americans today
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   is because there is a secular mindset that is radically different from a biblical mindset.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Let me try to unpack what I mean by a secular mindset.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   The secular mindset is not necessarily a mindset that denies the existence of God,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   nor necessarily a mindset that denies even the truth of the Bible.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Rather, it's a mindset that rules man into the center and rules God onto the periphery.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's a way of thinking that starts with man at the center
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and a cluster of needs and rights and expectations that man has,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and then it begins all of its thinking and moves out from that center.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And it judges to be problems, things in the world and in the universe
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   that don't fit with this beginning, with this mindset, with this starting point,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   with man at the center, our rights, our needs, our expectations.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And so what are understood as problems are things that don't fit with that,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   or what are understood as successes are things that endorse that,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   that fulfill those needs, enable and establish those rights,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and jive with those expectations.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And so you interpret the whole universe with this beginning point
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   of man at the center with his needs and expectations.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We're born with this mindset.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It is not a modern mindset, though modernity puts certain twists on it
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and intensifies it through the media.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Nevertheless, it's not new.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   We were born with it.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Paul calls it the mind of the flesh in Romans 8:6.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He calls us, apart from grace, the natural man.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's the way we think.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We come into the world with this mindset.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You don't get it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It gets reinforced every hour of the day in America
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   through every form of journalism and television and radio
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and all kinds of media, books, newspapers.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But you didn't get it from the newspapers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It was part of your nature.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And you don't even know you have it.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The world does not know they have this mindset
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   until it collides with another one, namely the one in the Bible.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   The biblical mindset, on the other hand, is not simply one that includes God
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   somewhere in the universe or simply says that the Bible is true.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   That's not the biblical mindset, pure and simple.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   The biblical mindset begins with a radically different starting point,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   namely God and God's rights,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   an absolutely foreign concept in this nation,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   that God has rights and God has goals.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And when you start with that at the center and then move out,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   you define problems in the universe very differently
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   than if you start with yourself at the center.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Problems emerge as what doesn't fit with God's intentions and God's goals
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and God's rights and his will to manifest God.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And so you just see the universe totally differently
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   when you begin with God at the center, his rights and his goals
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   as the assumption of the universe.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Is the basic riddle of the universe to preserve man's rights
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and solve man's problems,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   say the right of self-determination or the problem of suffering?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Or is the basic riddle of the universe how an infinitely worthy God
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   in complete freedom can display the whole range of his perfections
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   adequately for all to see and if they will, to worship and enjoy?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Is his holiness and power and wisdom and justice and wrath
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and goodness and truth and grace the agenda of the universe?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Is the meaning and purpose of everything to manifest God,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   to display God, to exalt God?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Or are we the center? Are we the measure?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Are our rights the thing to be guarded?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Do we create and define the problems in the world?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Now how you answer that question will determine whether or not
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   you can understand the biblical teaching about justification.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   If you start with man at the center,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   with all of our natural tendencies of the human heart
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   to assert our rights and our wants and our expectations,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   you will assess the doctrine of justification radically differently
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   than if you begin with the biblical mindset that has God at the center
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and his goals and his rights uppermost.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Understanding the doctrine of justification, especially the ground of it,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   requires grasping the God-centeredness of God.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Until you feel that God is uppermost in the heart of God,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   that the most passionate heart for God in the universe is God's heart,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   until you feel that, you won't have an adequately biblical grasp
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   on the doctrine of justification.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   God does not disobey the first and great commandment.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   God, with all of his heart and soul and mind and strength, loves God.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   He delights in his glory. He rejoices in his magnificence.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   God is not an idolater.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And until you grasp that, until that takes hold of you,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   that God never commits idolatry.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   God always has himself at the center of his infinitely worshiping heart.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   You will not be able to make sense out of the doctrine of justification
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   the way the Bible makes sense out of it,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and especially its ground in Romans 3.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Now, I've been trying to say these kinds of things for about 20 years or so,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and if people are listening and they haven't thought about the God-centeredness of God
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and that he is uppermost in his own affections, it sort of hits them like a truck.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   But I want to tell you, this truck is laden with fruit.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And if you survive the impact, you will eat well for a long time to come.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   If it's strange to you, if what I've just said is strange to you,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   that God is uppermost in his own affections, that God never commits idolatry,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   that God loves God with infinite passion,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   that the Sunday school papers my boys bring home are defective
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   because they never have the words, "God loves himself more than he loves you."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   If you can survive the impact of that,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   then I think parts of the Bible will open to you that have been a closed book,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   and you may never even have known it.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I really want to encourage you to let God be God.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   What I'm claiming tonight now, so far,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   is that the answer to the first question of the Westminster Catechism
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   is the same for God as it is for man.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   What is the chief end of man?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   What is the chief end of God?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   The chief end of God is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Don't write a different catechism.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Don't make yourself the center of God's affections
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   if he has required him to be the center of yours.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   There's a demonic way to imitate God.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Satan used it on Eve.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Don't make that mistake.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   When God lives for his own glory,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   don't you interpret that to mean, "Well, we should imitate God.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   We live for our glory."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   The way you imitate a God who lives for his glory is to live for his glory.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Another way to say this is that God is righteous.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   What is righteousness to you?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I'll tell you what righteousness is as I understand it biblically.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   The opposite of righteousness is to value and enjoy
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   what is not valuable or rewarding, ultimately.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   The opposite of righteousness is when your valuing capacity,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   that heart in you that goes out and cherishes things and loves things
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and delights in things and craves things and wants things,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   goes after things that aren't valuable, namely anything but God.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Righteousness is doing what's right, namely,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   craving, delighting in, wanting, cherishing what is valuable
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   and infinitely valuable, God.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Therefore, when I say that God is righteous,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I mean that God never sets his infinite affections
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   on anything less than what is infinitely valuable,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   himself.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Solid gold.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   This is a clip worth listening to a few times.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's a profound and brilliant setup for understanding the doctrine of justification,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   why we must get right with God, why we must be justified.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   We'll never find out if we don't understand who God is in this way.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's a great clip.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I pulled it from John Piper's conference message titled,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "The Joy of God and His Fame," preached on October 9, 1992.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   The entire message is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Well, gold like this is all over the Piper Sermon Archive.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And if you find some gold to share, email me.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Speaking of the God-centeredness of God, on the flip side of this doctrine,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   we also find one reason why many people walk away from the gospel
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   and reject Christ outright.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   In fact, that is the story of Oprah Winfrey
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and why she rejects the God of the Bible.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   We'll hear her tragic story next time when we are rejoined in studio
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   We'll see you then.
