[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   On occasion, we talk about writing on this podcast and episode number three is a great
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.520]   example of this. And just this week, Josh from Bel Air, Maryland writes in and asks
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.600]   this, "Last year," I think it was January of 2013, "you tweeted about how much you love
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.680]   commas. Can you expand on what you meant by this tweet? 'I love commas. No punctuation
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.240]   mark is more useful in helping a reader know how you want your sentences to be read.'"
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.760]   And of course, it should be noted for listeners that your tweet about your love of commas
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.120]   has no commas.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   I have the conviction that grammatical rules and punctuation rules are practical ways of
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.920]   helping us love people. So grammar has a moral dimension to it. In other words, it's a moral
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.520]   dimension. In other words, if we could agree on certain grammatical features, that's what
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.240]   rules are, agreeing on certain grammatical features, what they mean, we will be able
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   to communicate. And that is a loving thing to do. It's unloving not to care if people
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.480]   understand what you say. If you say, "I'm going to talk and write any way I want. I
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.320]   don't care if people understand what I say," well then you're not a loving person, at least
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.320]   not in that moment. You're not acting in a loving way. It's unloving to cultivate patterns
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.920]   of grammar or punctuation that make communication harder.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   So when it comes to the comma, here is a friend indeed. This little fellow is the next best
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.280]   thing to being there. I mean, face-to-face communication lets you divide your phrases
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   by pauses, right? But in writing, how does your reader know when you want him to pause?
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.960]   Answer? The comma tells him so. So here's a couple of funny examples. Really more serious
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.000]   and funny maybe. Ephesians 4.28, so I'll put in the comma. "Let him that stole," comma,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.560]   "steal no more," comma, "let him labor working with his hands." Well, what if you dropped
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.920]   out all the commas or put them in the wrong place and you read it like this? "Let him
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   that stole steal. No more let him labor working with his hands." Same words, just paused in
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.640]   different places. Well, that's the opposite of what you mean. And so the comma rescues,
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   comes to the rescue to keep your meaning from being given exactly the opposite of your intention.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.400]   And I just was online with Justin Taylor a little while ago because I could remember
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.200]   him referring to this issue and he pointed me to this one. The serial comma, you know,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.840]   people say when you've got a list this and this and this and this, you don't need to
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   put the comma before the last and. Well, here's one where if you don't, you're in big trouble.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   "I'd like to thank my parents," comma, "Jesus and Ayn Rand." Like, oh, Jesus and Ayn Rand
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.440]   are your parents? No, no, no, that's not what I meant. Well, then put a comma after the
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.560]   second and. So it goes like this. "I'd like to thank my parents," comma, "Jesus," comma,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.280]   like it's before the end, "and Ayn Rand." So he's thanking three people, not parents
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.240]   who are Jesus and Ayn Rand. Without a comma there, it's very confusing and you'd have
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.080]   to reread it and say, "Oh, he couldn't mean that and so he didn't mean that." So rescue,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   be nice to your reader, help your reader. So when I'm writing, I think about the comma
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.160]   as a humble little servant ready at any moment to make my pauses clear. I'm not going to
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   make it clear and thus make my meaning understood. So the rule, I have one rule for commas. The
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   rule I follow is this. The comma signifies a pause in thought so as to avoid confusion.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.400]   That's my rule. Given that rule, I use it wherever it's needed. I don't care what anybody
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   else says, I'm going to use a comma if I can help my reader not confuse himself about my
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.200]   intention. Let me add one more thing and this would be a whole other way to go, but I've
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   got to stick it on at the end here. I write to be heard in the ear, not just to be understood.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.240]   I want what I write to sound good. I want it to have a certain rhythm or cadence or
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   meter or pulse. And I think reading is more enjoyable and more impactful and more memorable
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.760]   if the writing sounds in the ear as good as it means. So any place I think people might
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.600]   miss my cadence and could get help from a comma, I'm going to stick in a comma just
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   to help them keep going with me as if they're listening to me talk into their ear. So conclusion,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.680]   for love's sake and for understanding's sake and for beauty's sake, I love this little
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.160]   servant the comma.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.200]   Excellent. Thank you, Pastor John. Well, Jesus and Ayn Rand would have made a horrible couple,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.260]   but speaking of matchmaking, what about online dating? Is that a legitimate way for Christians
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.400]   to find a spouse? Pastor John says yes, and tomorrow he'll explain why. I'm your host,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.360]   Tony Ranke. We'll see you then.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360]   [END]
