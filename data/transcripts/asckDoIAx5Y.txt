[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   Getting dirty is not only good, it's essential. We're all focused on the screens and the kids
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.340]   are on computers too much of the time, and that's all true. But the bigger issue is they're not
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.920]   outside getting dirty, interacting with nature. Because after our initial journey through the
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.560]   birth canal, those of us who are lucky enough to be born vaginally, that's when we get colonized
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.420]   with a mother's good bacteria. And that forms the beginnings of our foundational microbiome.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.540]   So after that, we then need to get those microbes from nature, from food, ideally that's grown in
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.220]   dirt, and from getting dirty ourselves, from being out there with grass and trees and all of it. And
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.400]   we see that kids who are born in the hospital via C-section, who don't get the benefit of coming
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.620]   through the birth canal, they are colonized with hospital-acquired staph instead of the mother's
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.060]   healthy bifidobacterium lactobacillus. And interestingly, Chris, for years after birth,
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.300]   they have higher rates of allergies, of asthma, of autoimmune disease, and of obesity.
