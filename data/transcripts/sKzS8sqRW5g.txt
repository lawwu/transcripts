[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   The following sermon which was recorded on Sunday morning January 30th 1955
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.600]   is the 16th in a series of sermons preached by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000]   on St. Paul's letter to the Ephesians.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   The doctor has arrived at Ephesians chapter 1 verses 8 and 9
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.000]   and we join him now during his opening introductory remarks.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.800]   That each thought as it were lives on to the next.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.400]   Each one has something new and fresh and yet every one of them is related to all the others
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   so that they all go together and in a sense must always be considered and remembered together
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   if we really are to have a good and a thorough grasp of the truth.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:57.400]   The apostle that you remember has been externing the glory and the riches of the grace of God
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.000]   by which the things which he has already mentioned have come to us.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   It is because of this wonderful grace of God that God has chosen us in Christ
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600]   before the foundation of the world and has predestinated us
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.000]   unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ and all that that involves.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And all that he has reminded us has come to us in experience and experimentally
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   by means of the great redemption through the blood of Christ.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We could experience none of these things apart from that
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   because we are sold under sin by nature.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We are all the children of wrath.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So that before this great purpose can come to us something had to happen and it has happened.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   God sent his own Son and he has delivered us, he has purchased us, he has redeemed us,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   he has ransomed us from the grip of the law and from the devil and from hell.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And we have been set free.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And in particular we enjoy the priceless blessing of the forgiveness of sins.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Now the apostle has been saying all that and he couldn't say it
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   without praising the riches of God's grace.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But even there he can't stop.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   He goes on because as he tells us, grace does not exhaust itself at that point.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The tragedy is that so many think that that is the end of grace.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That the one and only message of Christianity is the forgiveness of sins.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But it isn't. That's the mere beginning.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Paul puts that first as we saw because it is the first thing.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But the riches of grace don't end at that point.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's, I say, but the introduction, the essential first step.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And then there are other great and mighty things that follow.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You notice the apostle having used his superlative feels that even that wasn't enough, he must add to it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Let us take it together.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   according to the riches of his grace, wherein he has abounded.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   The riches of abounded.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You see, that wasn't enough to call it riches.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And to define its endlessness in terms of riches, he's got to add that it's abounded towards.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And it is to that further aspect of the working of God's grace that we now turn.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And to which we must give our careful and our serious attention.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Now, in order to understand these two verses, we must first of all deal with what we may describe as the mechanics.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We must get clearly in our minds exactly what the apostle does say.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And that leads to a consideration of the very phraseology of the two statements.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Now, in this authorized version, we have "wherein he hath abounded towards us".
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But it is generally agreed, and there can indeed be no question about this, that that is not a very good translation.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It is better to take it like this, "which he has caused to abound towards us".
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's a better way of taking it for this reason.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   This "wherein he hath abounded towards us" rather directs our attention to God himself.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Whereas it's perfectly clear that at this point the apostle really wants us to concentrate upon the grace.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The riches of his grace.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And then he goes on to say, "the riches of his grace, which he hath caused to abound towards us".
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Of course, it's God who's done it.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But what the apostle is here emphasizing is the way in which God's grace in its riches has abounded towards us.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So rather than "wherein he hath abounded", let us take it as "which he hath caused to abound towards us".
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And then there is a further problem.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And that is to decide the relationship of the statement "in all wisdom and prudence".
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Now there has been a good deal of disagreement about this.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Here in this authorized version and in the revised version which you have before you,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   you find that these words "in all wisdom and prudence" are in the eighth verse
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and linked to God causing his grace to abound towards us.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But you will find in this revised standard version, which is so popular at the present time,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   that there, there is a difference.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   They put those words in the ninth verse.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And so the eighth verse there is a very short verse, just this, "which he hath caused to abound towards us".
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Then it goes on to say "having in all wisdom and prudence made known unto us the mystery of his will" etc.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Now ultimately of course it comes very much to the same thing, and yet it does seem to me
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   that it is rather vital that we should be clear about this matter.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Because as I understand it, if this is a description of how the grace of God abounds towards us,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   it is rather important that we should take these words "wisdom and prudence" in the eighth verse
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and not in the ninth, and take them in connection with the grace of God.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Now there are three possible ways in which you might interpret it. Let me just note them.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   You might say that God in the exercise of his wisdom and prudence has abounded towards us in grace.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   That's one possible way of taking it.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Another way of taking it is this, that he has made known to us in all wisdom and prudence the mystery of his will.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's how the revised standard version takes it.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But it seems to me that a much better way, and the one that is rarely suggested by the authorised and revised versions,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   if we just change that first part of verse 8, is to take it like this, which, referring to the grace,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   "in connection with this, or together with it, he has caused to abound toward us his grace in wisdom and prudence."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Now then, I argue that it should be taken like that for this reason.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I don't think that it is right to attribute the all wisdom and prudence to God, and for this reason,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that God being himself absolute wisdom, we have no right to say, and it is indeed not right that we should say,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   that God does anything in all wisdom.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We can speak of men doing things in all wisdom, but God is essential wisdom.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And therefore you can't apply a term like all wisdom, doing something in all wisdom, to God.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It's lacking in reverence.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And that is still more applicable to the use of the word prudence.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Nowhere in the whole range of the Bible and the realm of Scripture is the term prudence ascribed to God.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   You can use it about men again, but it's inappropriate to use it with respect to God,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   all whose ways are perfect, and who is, as I say, absolute and eternal wisdom.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Very well then, surely I say that we must regard the wisdom and the prudence as something that are applicable to us,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and which have come to us as the result of the working of God's grace.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Very well then, we can translate our statement, our passage, in this way.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   What the apostle is saying is that the riches of God's grace toward us have not stopped in the matter of forgiveness,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   but that God's grace toward us has so abounded that it has brought to us something further.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And what is that something further?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Well, it is this very wisdom and prudence, whereby we may know,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and which are absolutely necessary too, a knowledge of the mystery of God's will
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   and of his eternal purpose in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Very well.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   If that is so, this is the third great statement which the apostle makes here,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and in which he tells us the things that God has done with respect to us.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   First, he has chosen us.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Secondly, he has predestinated us.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Thirdly, he has made known unto us the mystery of his will.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   In other words, you see, there is a definite sequence here.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   The apostle is concerned to tell us what God has done, and those are the three great things.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Here it is, he puts it again in this ninth verse.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   God, in his own eternal purpose, you see,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   which he hath purposed in himself.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   God has purposed in himself, before the foundation of the world,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   this great plan, this great scheme of redemption and of salvation.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It is something that originated entirely in the mind and in the heart of God.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   He purposed it in himself.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It is not a response to anything that man has asked for.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It is not God's reply to anything that man has initiated.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   No, no, he purposed it in himself, before the foundation of the world.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And what he has purposed is, of course, this good pleasure of his towards men,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   this good will towards men that the angels talked about, you remember.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Peace on earth, good will towards men, the good pleasure of his will.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   There it is, according to his good pleasure.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Now, says the apostle, God has not only purposed and planned all that,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   he has revealed it.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It was a mystery, but he has made it known.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Yes, and still more wonderful,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   and this is the particular message of these two verses,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   God has also done this something which makes it possible for you and for me to know that,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   and to apprehend it, and to receive it.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Now, that's the way in which the riches of God's grace have abounded toward us.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   in order that we might have this insight and understanding
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   into the mystery of God's will and his gracious purpose.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Very well, that's our theme.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And I think you see at once what a fundamental and vitally important theme it is.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   It is particularly important at this present time,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   because here the apostle is handling and dealing with
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   the whole question of our approach to Christian salvation.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And as you know, it is not only a matter of great discussion at the present time,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   as it always has been in a sense in the history of the Church,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   but it is a particular cause of stumbling to the modern man.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   We are here face to face with the whole problem, if you like, of revelation and reason,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   or if you prefer it, faith and reason.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   The problem that is raised here by this statement of the apostle,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   it's we who make the problem, not the apostle,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   but the problem is, how does man enter into all this?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   What is the place of man's mind and reason and understanding in connection with faith?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   You see how contemporary and up-to-date a problem it is.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   There are so many today who reject the Christian faith because they don't understand it.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   They say it's unreasonable, it doesn't fit into the usual categories of thought,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and so on and so forth.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And that seems to them to be good and sufficient ground for finishing with it and rejecting it,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   and saying that it's got nothing to say today.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Now, that's the very thing which the apostle lays down here.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It is, I say, one of these crucial matters.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's absolutely vital for the preaching of the gospel and evangelism.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It determines our whole approach towards these questions,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and particularly with respect to the message.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   The question is, I say, how does a man come to a knowledge of the great salvation
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   which is in Christ and the mighty and eternal purpose of God?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Now, we can do nothing better than just take the terms that the apostle uses.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   His first term is the term "mystery,"
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   having made known unto us the mystery of his will.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Now, this word, this term "mystery," is, as you know, a very important one
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   in the whole teaching of the epistles of the apostle Paul.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But it isn't confined to him by any means.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It is, I would suggest, a very vital term in the entire teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Our Lord himself, you remember, used this term.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   You remember how we are told in the thirteenth chapter of the gospel according to St. Matthew,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   in the parallel passages such as Mark 8, etc.,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   how our Lord had to explain to the disciples this method of his of teaching the mystery of the truth
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   concerning the kingdom in parables.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   They couldn't quite understand this, so our Lord took them into the house,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and he said unto them, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   but to them it is not given."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   The teaching concerning the kingdom of heaven is a mystery,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   and to the disciples he is making it known, but not to the others.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   So that though the Pharisees and others were standing by and hearing the same words
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   as he spoke and uttered his parables, they didn't understand them.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   They went away with a wrong impression.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   "It's the mystery of the kingdom," says our Lord.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Very well, there's our term.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   But it isn't the only place in which it's used.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Listen, for instance, to the apostle Paul using it in the sixteenth chapter,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   the last chapter of the epistle to the Romans, in verses 25 and 26.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   "Now unto him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   made known to all nations for the obedience of faith."
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   There it is, very clearly.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   But then you remember we had it in that chapter which we read at the beginning.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   It's in the first epistle to the Corinthians, the second chapter, and verses 6 and 7.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   "Howbeit," says the apostle, "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to naught,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   which God ordained before the world unto our glory."
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Now there is a further example of it,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and again the apostle uses it in the third chapter of this epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   in the third verse.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He says, "You have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you, O Lord,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   as I wrote afore in few words, whereby when he read, he may understand my knowledge
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Doesn't the apostle Paul repeat himself?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   You know, every good teacher repeats himself.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And of course a teacher of the gospel has got something worth repeating.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   In these different epistles you find the apostle saying exactly the same thing.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And again he says it finally in writing to Timothy in 1 Timothy 3, 16,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Now then, it is a patently key term,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and if we don't understand its meaning, we shall certainly go astray
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   in this matter of how a man becomes a Christian,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   and the relationship of reason to faith, and of mind to salvation.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   What then does this term mean?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Well, let us have a few negatives.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It does not mean, after the manner of the cults and the mystery religions
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   which were common in Paul's day, a kind of mystic secret,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   which is only revealed to a few initiates,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and which is deliberately kept from and guarded from everybody else.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Now that was the characteristic of the mystery religions.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   You went into the temples and you went through certain procedures.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   It was a secret that rarely was confined to certain philosophers and exceptional people.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It was never given to the common ordinary people.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Oh no, it was closely guarded and kept,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   and there was a great ceremony and ritual, and then you were initiated.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   There are certain cults, as you are familiar with at the present time,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   which are clearly based upon such practices,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   and of which the very antithesis of the Christian faith,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   behind closed doors, and the secret is kept, it must never be divulged, and nobody knows.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   It is the opposite of Christianity, which proclaims, preaches, expounds, heralds,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   wants everybody to know it.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It isn't that, you see.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It isn't some closely guarded mystic secret, into which the initiates alone are admitted.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   But still more important, perhaps, is it that we should say this,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   that when this truth is described as a mystery,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   it doesn't mean that it is something which is incomprehensible to the human mind,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   in and of itself, and therefore vague and nebulous and indefinite.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Now that, perhaps, is the more important point to emphasise today,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   because there is a popular school of thought which says something like this.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   It says, you know, the Christian faith can never be stated in propositions.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Those of you who are interested in theology and the contemporary debate,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   and who are following the journals, will know that that is the essential position
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   of the so-called Barthian movement, the followers of Karl Barth, of Switzerland.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   They say that truth, salvation, cannot and must not be stated in propositions.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Well, what is it then? Well, it's essentially an encounter.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It is this existential moment when God speaks to man and addresses him and something happens.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And all men's attempts and endeavours to put it into printer of necessity are wrong and false and misleading.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   That is why they say that ultimately all you have in the Bible is very fallible, of course.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It's only men's attempts to state this vital thing that happened at the moment of encounter.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   But you mustn't tell men that they've got to believe certain propositions.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   They say truth can never be stated propositionally. It's a mystery.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   In other words, their definition of a mystery is something that is incomprehensible,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   something that men cannot state and men cannot express,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and that any attempt to do so derogates from it and detracts from it.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Now, I say that it is vitally important that we should realise that that is not the meaning of mystery.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   That view of mystery is not confined to the Barthian movement and to its various adherents.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   There are others who believe the same thing. There was once a slogan which put it like this.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It said, "Religion is taught, not taught."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   You see, it's something that you catch.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It's a spirit, something indefinable, something that you can't state in terms.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   You must never have a confession of faith. You must never have a creedal statement.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   No, no, they say that's wrong, that's to be rationalistic, that's bringing the mind in.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   No, no, they say religion is something of the spirit, and it's something that you catch.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You meet people who've got it. You can't tell exactly what it is,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   but you know they've got it and you'd like to have it, and you can have it, and you catch it,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and it spreads like this from one to another.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Religion is taught, not taught.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Not a matter of ideas and statements and propositions.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Now, I'm contending that that is an utter violation of what the New Testament means by the term mystery,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   and that there is nothing, finally, which is more dangerous than that teaching.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Of course, as I'm suggesting, it's very popular today.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You really, you know, cannot have a successful ecumenical movement unless you believe something like that.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   The only hope of having a successful ecumenical movement is to say,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   "Now, you mustn't come down to particularities. You mustn't insist upon anything."
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   As long as we all believe in Christ and are somehow in Christ, well, we're all one.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Roman Catholics as well, of course, an ultimate great world church, inclusive of everybody.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   People call themselves humanitarians. Well, of course, that's their attempt to explain things.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   They're all one. They believe in Christ. Let's all get together who are in Christ.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Evangelism, they say, "Yes, but if you're going to evangelize, you must have a theological truth."
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   We've been hearing a lot about that during this last year.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Let's have a theological truth during the campaign.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Evangelism means bringing people to Christ. You afterwards begin to decide what they're to believe about Christ.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   But it doesn't matter about that. Let them come to Christ, and afterwards they can decide what they're going to believe.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Now, all that, in a sense, is based upon this idea that the Christian truth is essentially mysterious in the sense
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   that it is incomprehensible to the human intellect, and that it never can be understood,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and that therefore we must never try to do so and to state it, but must all vaguely believe in Christ.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I suggest that those definitions of mystery are utterly erroneous.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   What does mystery then mean? Well, this.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   It is not something that is incomprehensible to the human mind,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   but it is rather something that is undiscoverable to the unaided human mind.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   You see the difference?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   The first definition says that it is always incomprehensible.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   The second definition says no.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   The human mind, by its own efforts and endeavours, can never arrive at it.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   But if it is enabled to do so, it does begin to comprehend it.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It is a mystery in the sense that men with his unaided human form, mind and intellect,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   can never discover it and arrive at it.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   But when it is revealed, he is able to do so.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Notice how Paul puts it. He calls it God's wisdom.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   He says it is a hidden wisdom.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And he says the princes of this world didn't know it. Why?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Well, because they were seeking to understand it with their own minds.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   But, says the apostle, God hath revealed it unto us by the Spirit.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   We have received, he goes on to say, not the spirit that is of the world,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   but the spirit that is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   We may know them.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   They become comprehensible because of the result of the operation of the Spirit.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And, of course, in saying all that, the apostle is simply repeating what our blessed Lord had said before him.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Go to the eleventh chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And there you will find our Lord turning to his Father and saying,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   that thou hast hidden things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Even so, Father, for so it hath seemed good in thy sight.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   God hides them from the wise and prudent.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   It remains a mystery to the wise and prudent, but not to the babes.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   God reveals them unto the babes in order that they may enjoy them.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   In other words, the term mystery means this,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that this great truth of God's will and purpose and salvation
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   can only be received when God makes it known and reveals it.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And what the apostle says that he has done so,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   having made known unto us the mystery of his will.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Very well, then, mystery means this,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   not something inherently and essentially incomprehensible to the human mind,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   but rather something which is a secret to the natural human mind,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   which God nevertheless has revealed and unfolded.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   The whole case of the New Testament turns upon this,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   that the believers in Christ, the Christians, have entered into the secret,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   have had the mystery revealed to them.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It doesn't remain a mystery to the Christian.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   It's a mystery to the non-Christian.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   To the Christian it is an open secret,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   because God in his grace and kindness has been pleased to unfold it and to reveal it.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Very well, that's the first step.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   But let us go on to the second step.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Is it therefore true to say that because God has made this revelation
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   of the mystery of his will in Christ,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   that anybody who chooses to do so can receive it and understand it?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   God has revealed it in Christ. Very well.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Can any man come to the New Testament and read it,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   and apply his mind and his intellect to it,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and therefore receive the message?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   The answer is no.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And this is the very thing that the apostle is here emphasizing.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   It brings us to the words "wisdom and prudence".
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   What does it mean exactly?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Well, it means this,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Not many wise, not many noble are called."
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Yes, there was the truth staring them in the face, as it were,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   standing in front of them.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   They couldn't see it.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Men come to the New Testament with all their ability and understanding and training.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   They don't see the truth.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And they never can without the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   The Holy Spirit and his operation upon us is absolutely essential
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   before we can receive the truth and begin to understand it.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Wisdom is necessary.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And wisdom means, of course, knowledge and understanding.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   The best exposition of these two verses, in other words,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   is to be found in the first two chapters of that first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   "The great quest of the Greeks was for wisdom.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   The great quest of all philosophers is for knowledge and for understanding.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   They try to find God and to understand him and the world,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   but the world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   The world's wisdom is not enough, yet not the wisdom of this world, says God.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   We speak the wisdom of God.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   It's entirely different.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   God must give the understanding also.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   So that the apostle says in writing to the Corinthians again in that first epistle and in the third chapter,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   one of the most vital things he ever said,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   "If any man would become wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be made wise."
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   In other words, if you want to understand and enter into this wisdom of God, what have you got to do?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   You've got to become a little child.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You've got to renounce the earthly human wisdom and the human powers and faculties.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   You've got to become a fool.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   You've got to say, "I know nothing. My abilities are of no value. I become as a little child."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except he be born again, he shall not enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's it.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   But the glory of it is this, says the apostle,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   that God in his grace has revealed it unto us.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   He's given us. His grace has abounded toward us,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   so that we can say, "We have the mind of Christ."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Did you notice that peroration at the end of that second chapter of 1 Corinthians?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   "He that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   He understands, but nobody can understand him.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   "Well, who hath known the mind of the Lord? Who hath been his instructor?"
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   How can we understand these things?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Here's the answer. We have the mind of Christ.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   How have we got it?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   It's because of the riches of God's grace, which have abounded toward us in all wisdom.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   He's given us the power to understand and to comprehend, but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It's not only all wisdom, but also prudence, you notice.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Now, what's the meaning of this?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Well, the term prudence, as used in the New Testament,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   at least the word that is translated prudence here,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   doesn't carry generally the meaning that we normally attach to the word prudence.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Our familiar customary use of it is of further refinement.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Let me give you some other examples of the use of the same essential word in the New Testament.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   You remember Simon Peter, after having made his great confession at Caesarea Philippi,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   when our Lord told him that he'd got to go to the death of the cross,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Peter said, "Far be it from thee, Lord, this shall not happen unto thee."
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Our Lord turned on him and said, "Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest not the things which be of God."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   You don't savour them.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   You're not appreciating them, you're not understanding them.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   But let me give you another illustration.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   In Romans 8, 5, you read this,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   "They that are in the flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and they that are in the Spirit, or after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit."
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   That's the same term, the minding of the things of the flesh.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   That's their interest, that's the realm that attracts them, that's where they live.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Those are the things that they savour and enjoy.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Or take again in Colossians 3, 2,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   "Set your affections on things above."
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   The same word as this, "Set your affections."
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Now then, that helps us to understand the meaning of this prudence, doesn't it?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   It means, you see, a state of mind which includes the affections as well as the understanding.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Wisdom is a matter of the intellect and of the understanding.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Prudence includes the affections as well as the mind.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   So you can translate it, if you're right, "insight."
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   In all wisdom and insight, or if you prefer it, you can translate it as "spiritual discernment."
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   The ability to discern, spiritual apprehension of the excellence of the things of God,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and the corresponding affection towards them, that's the thing.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   So that the riches of God's grace have abounded toward us,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   not only in this wisdom that gives me understanding,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   not only that it takes up the whole of my soul, the whole men,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   it includes my affections, my interest, my love,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   my whole being is called out unto it and I want it,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and with my whole being I take it up and take it in.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   All wisdom and prudence.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   The riches of God's grace have abounded toward us in this way, then,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   that not only do I understand it with my mind,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   my whole being goes out to it in a glad and a willing and a ready response.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   That is the doctrine.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Well, if that is the doctrine, I'm following conclusions,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and I'm just going to give you them boldly, asking and pleading of you to consider them at your leisure.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   If this is true, then advances in knowledge and in science
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   and the advance of the centuries make not the slightest difference in this connection
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and are completely irrelevant.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Now, I came across a statement only yesterday,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   which shows you how necessary it is to say something like that today.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   I was reading a review of a book by a man,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   and he went on to deal with those who are very fond of praising the theology of the 15th,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   16th and the 17th centuries, and also certain Roman Catholic writers.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And he put it like this.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   He said, "I am less sure than I was, however,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   that the categories of those great days are adequate for a discussion of the problems
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   raised for our thought by our neophysicists."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Do you see what he means?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   He says, "It's no use reading and considering the great theologies of the past, in a sense.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   They can't help us now.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   We've got the problems raised and poised for us by this new physics,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   atomic physics, the neophysicists.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And of course there are new problems confronting us because of the advances in knowledge and in thought
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   and this understanding that we have of the cosmos and the working of the universe."
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And he says, "It's no use going back.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   We obviously must have something new before we can understand spiritual truth
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and the way of God with respect to men and the way of salvation at the present time
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   because of these new problems, because of the advances of men's minds."
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   But that's simply a complete denial of what the apostle teaches in these two verses
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   we are considering this morning and, I suggest, the whole of the New Testament.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   The mind of men at its best was never adequate.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   To the natural men this remains a mystery.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   It was a mystery nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   It is equally a mystery today.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And neophysics doesn't make the slightest difference.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   We are concerned about God, man, sin, and what has the atomic discovery to do with that.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   It's quite irrelevant. It's right outside.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   And to say, therefore, that the age of neophysicists needs some new kind of truth and understanding
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   is a denial of the very basis of the Christian faith.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   The mind of men at its best in any age or generation will never arrive at it.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Secondly, therefore, I say this.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   The scriptures and the scriptures alone must always be our sole and final authority
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   with regard to all these matters.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   The modern men, the modern mind, make no difference at all.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   The revelation is here and it remains here.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And there is nothing additional. There never will be. It is all here.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   The revelation has been made. God has revealed the mystery.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And, therefore, to talk about the modern mind and the modern men is to deny the scriptures.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   There will be, there never can be, any advance on what has already been revealed.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   We live upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and cannot go beyond them.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Thirdly, I say that the work of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential to an understanding of the scriptures.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I don't care who you are nor what you are.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   If you are not enlightened by the Holy Spirit, you will not understand the scriptures.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   You cannot. It's impossible.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   But, lastly, I delight to say this.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Because of God's way, there is hope for all to understand.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Being that it is something that is revealed by God and which he enables us to understand
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   by giving us wisdom and prudence,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   intellect or the absence of intellect does not make a vital difference.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   The understanding which is given by God through the Holy Spirit is open to all.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Again, I remind you what Paul says to the Corinthians.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   "Not many wise, not many noble are called.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   God has taken the foolish things, the ignorant, the hopeless, the vile, the things that are not,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   to bring to nothing things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence."
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   It isn't intellect that makes a man a Christian.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   There is no advantage in having a great brain in this realm.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   It is all spiritual. It is all given by God.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   He gives the wisdom and the prudence as well as the truth.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   We are all on the same level.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   And we must therefore glory in nothing and in no one, save in the Lord himself.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And this is the whole basis of the missionary activity.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   You can go this morning to the heart of Central Africa,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and you can visit a tribe that can't read nor write and has never had any learning,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   and you can take this great epistle to the Ephesians and present it to them,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   and they can believe it. Why?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Because God enlightens them through the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Most of the early Christians were slaves.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   The gospel is preached to the poor.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Throughout the centuries it has been the same.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Thank God for this.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   If it were otherwise, men of intellect would have a greater advantage over others.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   But here we are all one. There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   No man can arrive at it. The world by wisdom knew not God,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   but it hath pleased God by the foolishness of the thing preached,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   to save them that believe.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   What a marvelous, what a glorious thing it is,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   which he hath therefore caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   which he purposed in himself.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   I cannot end without uttering these great words of the same apostle.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Who but God would ever have contrived such a way of salvation,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   such a perfect way of salvation?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   For on him and through him and to him are all things,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   to whom and to whom alone be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
