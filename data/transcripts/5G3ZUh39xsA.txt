[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.120]   in the first epistle to the Corinthians, the fifteenth chapter, verses 8, 9 and 10.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.640]   Verses 8, 9 and 10 in the fifteenth chapter of the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.720]   And last of all, he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.600]   For I am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle, because
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.960]   I persecuted the church of God.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.000]   But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.200]   in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.120]   which was with me.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.440]   And last of all, he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.400]   We are considering together this all-important theme to all of us who are Christians and
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.240]   in the Christian life, the theme that we have described under the heading of spiritual depression.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.840]   God's people are constantly subject and prone to this, and there is nothing that therefore
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.480]   should engage our attention more closely or more urgently than this condition, because
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.440]   there can be no doubt at all about it that what finally explains the fact that the vast
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.000]   majority of the people in this and in other lands are outside the Christian church is
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.520]   the failure of those who are inside the church to represent the truth truly.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.080]   Men and women are ready to look at anything and to be interested in anything that is attractive.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.400]   We are living in an age of advertising, and people are ready and credulous to believe
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800]   anything that is said to them.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.040]   They believe advertisements, they believe what they are told.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.360]   And so it follows of necessity that were they to see something or to find something in Christian
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   people and in the Christian church, which evidently and obviously proclaimed that such
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   people were living a life of joy and of happiness and of triumph, they would crowd after them
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.000]   and be anxious to discover the secret of their successful living.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.440]   Therefore I say it is not an unfair deduction to say that what accounts for the fact that
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.460]   the masses are outside is the condition of those who are inside.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.440]   So often we give the impression that we are dejected and depressed.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.960]   Indeed many would almost give the impression that to become a Christian means that you
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.160]   are face to face with lots of problems which never worried you before.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.520]   And looking very generally and superficially, the man of the world comes to the conclusion
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.640]   that if you really want to be happy, you go to the people who are outside the church rather
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   than to those who are inside the church.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.960]   He is quite wrong, of course.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.320]   But I say we must recognise his merlent manner of thinking, and we at any rate have to,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:16.080]   I plead guilty to this charge, that far too often, because we suffer from spiritual depression
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.800]   and are more or less miserable Christians, we grossly and grievously misrepresent the
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   gospel of redeeming grace.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.840]   And that is why we are engaged in this study of this condition, not only for our own sakes.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.160]   We do look at it for our own sakes, because it is tragic that anybody who claims the name
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.420]   of Christ should be in this condition.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.520]   But more important far is the other consideration of which I have just reminded you.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.700]   Now this, of course, is all due to the fact that we are confronted by a very powerful
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   adversary.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.920]   I have said what I have said not merely by way of criticism.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.040]   I have stated it as a fact in order that we may consider it.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.200]   The fact is, of course, that the moment we become Christian, we become subjected to the
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.160]   most subtle and powerful onslaughts of the one who is described in the Bible as the prince
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.240]   of the power of the air, the one that now ruleth in the children of disobedience, the
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   God of this world, Satan, the devil.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.920]   And as we go on considering this condition and its various manifestations and causes,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.460]   we cannot but be impressed by his subtlety, the way in which he is able to come to us
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.240]   and to attack us, and the subtle way in which he deludes us and leads us astray without
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.420]   our realizing it at all.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.720]   And of course he is at his most subtle when he comes to us as an angel of light and as
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.080]   a would-be friend of the Church and one who is interested in the gospel and in its propagation.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.560]   For according to the scriptures he does that.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.580]   It is this apostle Paul who tells us in his second epistle to the Corinthians that he
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.480]   is able to transform himself into an angel of light.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.920]   And it is at that point, I say, he is most subtle of all.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.040]   Not only is he able, not only is he powerful, he is subtle.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.880]   And as we look at these various forms and methods of attack that he implies, this, I
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.480]   say, becomes more and more clear.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.640]   The only thing, therefore, to do is to prepare ourselves for the hymn and for the attacks.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.920]   And the way to do that is to study the scriptures.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.240]   Here we are told all about it.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.520]   We are given an insight into his methods.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.480]   We are not ignorant of his devices, says the apostle Paul, again to these Corinthians.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.120]   But the tragedy is that so many are ignorant of his devices, do not even believe in his
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   existence.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.680]   And even those who do believe in him forget him and fail to realize that he is always
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   there and always attacking, and in this particularly subtle form.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.760]   Now, as we look at what he does to us objectively, we cannot, of course, but be amazed at ourselves
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.940]   and at our unutterable folly.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.220]   You look at some of these cases of spiritual depression that are recorded in the Bible,
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.440]   and as you read of them and look on at them, you say, "Well, how could a man have fallen
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   to that?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.940]   It seems so perfectly plain and obvious, yet we are constantly falling to the same thing."
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.400]   That is because of the subtlety of his method.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.600]   He conceals himself, and he puts it to us in such an interesting and attractive manner
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.760]   that we have fallen almost before we realize that anything happened.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.920]   Well, now then, I say the way to deal with all this is to study the methods and to study
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:04.000]   the various teachings of the Scripture itself with regard to this condition.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.840]   And that is what we want to continue doing this morning.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.600]   Now we have looked at this from various aspects.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   And last Sunday morning we were looking at it in this way, that so many are depressed
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   because they will keep on looking back into their past life, and especially to some sin
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.880]   of which they once were guilty.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.720]   Not sins in general, not sin in general, but some one particular sin.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.840]   That has often crippled many people.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.640]   They seem to be quite clear about everything but this one thing.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.040]   They cannot forgive themselves.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.600]   They cannot get over it.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.640]   They cannot forget it, and they are constantly in trouble as a result.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.920]   Now I want to continue that theme in a sense.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.500]   I want again to consider with you the case of others who are crippled in the present
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.320]   by looking back to the past.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:03.680]   Not this time to some particular sin, but rather to the fact that they spent so much
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:10.480]   time in that condition and were so late in coming into the kingdom.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.520]   Now this is again an extremely common cause of spiritual depression.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.120]   The people who are depressed by the fact that they have wasted so much time, wasted so many
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.680]   long years, and have been so slow to become Christian at all, they are always bemoaning
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:36.560]   the fact that they have missed so many opportunities, opportunities of doing good and of helping
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.480]   others and opportunities of service.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.120]   They say, "If only I had seen all this when I was young, I would have volunteered for
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.800]   service, but I didn't.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   I have only seen it now.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   It is too late."
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.840]   They have missed opportunities.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.320]   Or they put it in terms of what they might have done in some other form, some various
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.600]   other activities.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.000]   Or they may put it in this form.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.720]   What they might have been by now, if only.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.480]   That is the term, if only.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   But they didn't.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.520]   They spent so many years out in the world and not understanding these things.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.600]   And they have missed the opportunities of doing good and of helping others and of service.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.840]   And they think of themselves, what they might have been, how they would have grown in grace,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.960]   the point they would have arrived at by now.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.000]   But they are mere beginners and mere children.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.880]   They look back like this to the past and they regret it and they bemoan it.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.200]   They look back at the joys they might have had, the years of happy, joyful experience
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.020]   they might have had.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.160]   But it is too late.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.640]   The opportunity is gone.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.840]   Why were they so foolish?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.800]   How could they have been so blind?
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.880]   Why were they so slow?
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   They had heard the gospel, they had read books, they even felt something at a certain point,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.960]   but nothing happened.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.200]   The opportunity was allowed to go.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.320]   And here they are now, at long last, they have come into it, but.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.720]   And there is the phrase, "if only."
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   Now this, I say, is a very common condition.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.620]   And it accounts for this state of spiritual depression in large numbers of people.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.620]   How do we deal with this?
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.200]   What have we got to say about it?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.240]   Well I want to look at that with you this morning.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.880]   Let me start by saying that while it is perfectly right for such people to regret the fact that
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.960]   they have been so slow in this respect, it is quite right to regret it.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.760]   But it is quite wrong to be miserable about it.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.040]   You cannot very well look back across your past life without seeing things that you regret.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.440]   That is perfectly all right.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.240]   But this is where the subtlety comes in with this condition.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:57.480]   We cross that fine distinction, that line between a legitimate regret and a wrong condition
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.880]   of misery and of dejection.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.000]   Now the Christian life is a very finely balanced life.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.760]   That is one of its most attractive features.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.240]   It has often been compared to a man walking on a knife edge.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.640]   You can fall here or there.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.400]   It is a condition which involves a certain type of tension, a true tension, a good tension,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.520]   a right tension.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.680]   Not that the tension that involves strain, but it is such a high and noble and exalted
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.040]   life that all along we are having to draw these subtle distinctions.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:43.520]   And here is one of them, a legitimate regret, a wrong condition of dejection and of misery.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.240]   Well very well then, how do we avoid this being miserable?
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   Well we are going to do that in terms of what the Apostle Paul says here about himself,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.840]   which always seems to me to be such a perfect illustration of what our Lord taught in that
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.920]   parable that we read together out of the twentieth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.840]   I hope at some later time to return to that parable in the twentieth of Matthew again
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.560]   and look at it from a slightly different angle.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.640]   We shall be looking at it this morning from the standpoint of the people who are only
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.280]   engaged at the eleventh hour and who are the last to enter into the kingdom.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.920]   But before we come to that specific treatment of the matter in terms of scripture, let me
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   consider this with you in a more general way.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:40.200]   Now there are certain principles of common sense and of general wisdom that need to be
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.920]   applied to this condition.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:50.360]   I wonder whether I need to make an apologia for saying that or for proposing to do that.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.120]   There are some people who seem to think that it is wrong for a Christian ever to use common
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.440]   sense.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.640]   They seem to think that he must always be doing everything in some kind of purely spiritual
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.800]   manner.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.920]   Now that seems to me to be very unscriptural.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:16.680]   The Christian is never less than the unbeliever; he is always more.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.440]   The Christian is a man who can do everything that the unbeliever does, but more than that.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.060]   That is the way to look at the Christian.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:31.060]   So the Christian is a man who is to apply common sense to positions and to situations,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.880]   and it is right and legitimate that he should do so.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   If you can conquer the devil at that level, conquer him at that level.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.720]   It doesn't matter what level you conquer the devil at as long as you conquer him.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.680]   If you really can defeat him and rout him by using just common sense and ordinary wisdom,
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   do so.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:02.600]   It is a perfectly right and legitimate thing for a Christian person to do.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.880]   Now I am saying all this because I often find that people are in difficulty about this matter
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.400]   because they fail to do that.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.720]   They have spent the whole of their time in praying about this thing instead of doing
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.240]   something that I say is perfectly obvious from the standpoint of common sense.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.480]   Let me go on to explain what I mean.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.600]   Now the first thing, in other words, for anybody to say to himself who is in this condition,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.320]   or if you have to help somebody who is in this condition, the first thing you have to
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:35.960]   say to them is this, that to be miserable thus in the present because of some failure
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.880]   in the past is a sheer waste of time and a waste of energy.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.480]   That is all I mean.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.720]   Now I say that is common sense.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.280]   The past cannot be recalled.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.520]   You can do absolutely nothing about it.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.040]   Here you are in the present, you have become a Christian, you say, "Oh, if only!"
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.440]   But what a silly, what a foolish, what a ridiculous thing to say.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.560]   You cannot recall the past.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.480]   You can do nothing at all about it.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.520]   You can sit down and be miserable and go round and round in circles for the rest of your
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   life.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.000]   It will make no difference to what you have not done.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.400]   Now that is common sense, isn't it?
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.360]   It does not need a special Christian revelation to see that.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   The world in its wisdom tells us that it is no use crying over spilt milk.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.920]   Well apply that to the devil.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.280]   Why should the Christian be more foolish than anybody else?
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.920]   Why should he fail to apply common sense and ordinary natural human wisdom?
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.080]   But that is precisely what these people are doing at this point.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.520]   They are wasting their time and their energy in vain regrets about something that they
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.040]   cannot affect.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.600]   They cannot change, they cannot undo it.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   Now I lay down as a fundamental postulate of life at any level that that is a purely
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.040]   foolish and irrational thing to do.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.120]   Very well, then let's lay this down as a principle.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:21.520]   We must never for a second worry about anything that cannot be affected by us.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.120]   It is a waste of energy.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.400]   If you cannot do anything about a thing, stop thinking about it.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.800]   If it is done or has not been done once and for all and belongs to that past that is finished
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.980]   with once and forever, never again look back at it, never think of it.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.760]   If you do, it is the devil who has defeated you, beyond any question.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:51.840]   Again, useless regrets must be dismissed as irrational and idiotic.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.920]   But oh, how many are victims of that.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:00.260]   They sit down and they go back over it and go over all the details again and express
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.840]   their sorrow and their regret and their misery.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.560]   My friends, stop doing it.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.720]   Quite apart from Christianity.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.520]   It is a foolish thing to do.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   It is a sheer waste of energy, a waste of time.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   But let's go on.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:26.120]   Not only that, to do that simply causes failure in the present.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.480]   While you are sitting down and bemoaning the past and regretting what you haven't done
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.960]   in the past, you are crippling yourself in the present and preventing yourself from working
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.000]   in the present.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Is that Christianity?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.080]   Of course it is.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.160]   Christianity is common sense and much more.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.800]   But it is common sense, let's remember.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.320]   But you say, I could have heard that out in the world.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.360]   Well, if you could, hear it and act on it.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.200]   Our Lord himself has said that the children of this world are wiser in their generation
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.580]   than the children of light.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.120]   He commended the unjust steward.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.220]   I am simply doing that.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.600]   The world there, the common wisdom of mankind is perfectly right.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.800]   It is obviously a wrong and a foolish thing to be crippling yourself in the present by
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   vain regrets about a past which you can't undo.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.400]   It is always wrong to mortgage the present by the past.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.880]   It is always wrong to allow the past to act as a brake or as a drag upon the present.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.960]   Let the dead past bury its dead.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:43.400]   There is nothing, I say, that is more reprehensible, judged by any canon of thought, than to allow
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.920]   anything that belongs to the past to cause you to be a failure in the present.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.080]   And it does, of course.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.440]   The people I am describing are failing in the present.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.840]   Instead of doing something and getting on with the Christian life, they are sitting
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   down and are bemoaning the past.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.640]   They spend hours and weeks and months and, if necessary, years.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.680]   They are so sorry about this that they are doing nothing in the present.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.000]   How wrong it is!
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.560]   How reprehensible!
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.240]   And my third argument from the standpoint of ordinary common sense and human wisdom
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.920]   is this, that if you really believe what you say about your past, if you are really quite
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.960]   genuine about it, if you really do bemoan the fact that you have lost and wasted so
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   much time in the past, the thing to do is to make up for it in the present.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.480]   Isn't that common sense again?
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.800]   Here is a person who comes to me in utter dejection, "Oh, if only!
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.480]   The time I have wasted!"
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.600]   And what I say to such a person is, "Are you making up for lost time?
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.400]   Why are you using these minutes and this energy in telling me about that wasted past which
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   you cannot undo?
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.480]   Why don't you put your energy and your time into doing something now?"
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.880]   I speak with vehemence because I believe this condition has got to be dealt with in this
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.960]   way.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.600]   The last thing to do with such people is to sympathise with them.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.000]   And if you are suffering from this condition, be ruthless with yourself.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.280]   Shake yourself.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.400]   Attack yourself.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.880]   On all grounds of ordinary common sense, you are behaving as a fool.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   You are irrational.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.360]   You are wasting your time and your energy.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   You are not really believing what you are saying.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.980]   You are indulging in self-pity.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.200]   If you bemoan the wasted past, make up for it in the present.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.920]   Give yourself entirely to activity at this present moment.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.640]   That is what Paul did, wasn't it?
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.080]   "Last of all, he was seen of me also as one born out of due time.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.640]   For I am the least of the apostles, that I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.720]   I persecuted the church of God.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.440]   But by the grace of God I am what I am.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.600]   I have wasted a lot of time.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.840]   The others have gone ahead of me.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.880]   But this is the truth.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.000]   I laboured more abundantly than they all.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I have made up for it.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.520]   I have caught up with them.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360]   Very well.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360]   There is the argument.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.960]   There is the way of dealing with this thing from the standpoint and the aspect of common
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.320]   sense and of ordinary common or garden human wisdom.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.680]   But now let's go beyond that.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.800]   That is enough, you know.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.680]   That should be sufficient.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.640]   But let's go beyond it.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.680]   The Christian, I say, is not less than the unbeliever.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.420]   He is always more.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.480]   He has all the common sense and wisdom of the unbeliever, yes, but he has something
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.720]   on top of that, much greater than that.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.960]   And here we come to this statement of the great apostle and to our Lord's teaching
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   in the parable of the vineyard in Matthew 20.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.760]   Now let us again see what the apostle has got to say.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.720]   As we saw last Sunday morning in what he said about the great sin in his life, and as we
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.760]   saw that that alone is enough, rarely we will find the same thing again this morning.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   What does the apostle say?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.160]   Well, listen to it.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.760]   He has been giving an account of these resurrection appearances.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.680]   He is rarely concerned about that great doctrine.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:13.720]   But this is how he puts it, "Last of all, he was seen of me also."
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.560]   Now the apostle undoubtedly regretted that.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.040]   Let us be clear about what he means when he says "last of all."
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.160]   He means, first of all, the last of the apostles.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.440]   He was the last of the apostles to see the risen Lord.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.080]   They had all seen him in different ways together.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.320]   He was not with them then.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.760]   He was a blasphemer, a persecutor at that point and at that time.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.480]   So last of all, last of the apostles.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:50.840]   But not only last of the apostles, he was literally the last person of all persons to
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.080]   see the risen Lord.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.120]   No one has ever seen the risen Lord with his naked eyes since the apostle Paul saw him
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.800]   on the road to Damascus.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   Last of all.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   You see, he showed himself to five hundred brethren at once.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.320]   We do not know their names even.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.080]   But he did show himself to these various witnesses that are recorded here.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:22.280]   But the very last person of all to see him was Saul of Tarsus.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.760]   Because what happened on the road to Damascus was not that Paul had a vision.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.280]   Many have had visions since.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   That was not a vision.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.240]   He literally saw the Lord of glory with his naked eyes.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.520]   And that was what blinded him.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.080]   And that is what he says here.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   Last of all he was seen of me.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.400]   That is what made him an apostle.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.360]   He was a witness to the fact of the resurrection.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:51.680]   But the thing he is emphasizing is this, that he was the very last of all.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.720]   But you see, he is not content with leaving it at that.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:24:02.800]   He adds, "Last of all, he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time."
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:09.120]   The translation here is this, "Last of all, seen of me also who am an ectopic."
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.120]   He is a sort of ectopic gestation.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.680]   There is something unnatural, almost monstrous about his birth.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.880]   He has not come into these things in the way that others came in.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.040]   The others had been with the Lord during his life.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.440]   They had listened to his teaching.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.720]   They had been with him right to the very end and had seen the crucifixion.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.160]   They had been together when he appeared unto them after the resurrection during the forty
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   days.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.960]   They had been together at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.640]   They were all there at the beginning.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.000]   They had been right through it all.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.800]   And here is Paul, a kind of unnatural birth, untimely birth, an ectopic.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.840]   He has come in as it were in some odd, strange way.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   There is something unnatural.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.960]   That is how he has come in, "and last of all."
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.560]   That is what he says about himself.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.960]   And of course he could never think of that without regret.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.060]   He should have been in at the beginning.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.520]   He was a Jew like the others.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.660]   He had had the facilities and the opportunities.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660]   But he hated it.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.660]   He hated Christ.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.420]   He verily thought with himself that he should do many things contrary to the name of Jesus
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.420]   of Nazareth.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.160]   He regarded him as a blasphemer.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.840]   He tried to exterminate his followers and his church.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   There he was outside.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.400]   All the others were in, and in from the beginning and knew it all.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:41.080]   But at last, and last of all, and in this strange way, he had come in.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.540]   How easy it would have been for him to have spent the rest of his life in vain, regrets
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.760]   about the past.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:52.040]   He does say, "Last of all he was seen of me, for I am the least of the apostles, that
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.840]   I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.120]   It is perfectly true.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   And he bitterly regretted that, but that did not paralyse Paul.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.960]   Paul did not spend the rest of his life sitting in a corner and saying, "Of course I have
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   no right to speak.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.440]   I have been so long coming in.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.080]   I am the very last to come in, and I did this and that.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.720]   Oh, why did not I see it?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.840]   Why did not I believe in him?
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.400]   How could I have rejected him?"
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.240]   That is what these people with spiritual depression do.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.860]   They pass from regret to dejection.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.560]   The apostle did not.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.200]   What struck him was this amazing grace that ever brought him in at all, though he was
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   the last.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.440]   And he said, "There is no time to lose.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.720]   I must be up and doing."
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:37.000]   And he pressed into it with his tremendous zeal and passed them all.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Last of all, and yet he became first in a sense.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.640]   Well, what is his teaching?
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.320]   Well, let us take the apostle's experience and look at it in the light of the parable
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.800]   in the twentieth of Matthew.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.620]   They both say the same thing.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.540]   The teaching that I would deduce would be something like this.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.560]   What matters first of all—my dear friend, if you are a Christian, what matters first
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.660]   of all is not what you once were, but what you are.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.580]   Does not it sound ridiculous?
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.580]   It is so perfectly obvious.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.700]   It is almost childish.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.820]   I say that what matters is not what you once were, but what you are.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.500]   Yes, how obvious when I put it like this, but how difficult to see it sometimes when
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.340]   the devil attacks you and takes you back over your past.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.460]   The apostle having said that he is not worthy to be called an apostle because he persecuted
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:37.620]   the church of God adds, "But by the grace of God I am what I am."
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.740]   What does it matter what I was?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.980]   I am what I am.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.580]   Put your emphasis there, I say.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.580]   Do not be ever considering what you were.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.380]   The essence of the Christian position is to be ever reminding yourself of what you are.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:00.340]   Oh yes, there is your past with all its sin, but say this to it—ransomed, healed, restored,
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.540]   forgiven, who like thee his praise should sing?
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.340]   I am what I am.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.300]   Whatever the past may have been, it is what I am that matters.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.380]   What am I?
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.380]   I am forgiven.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.860]   I am reconciled to God by the blood of Christ.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.020]   I am born again.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.540]   I am a child of God.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.420]   I am adopted into God's family.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.420]   I am an heir with Christ and a joint heir with him.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.660]   I am going to glory.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.660]   I am.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:31.700]   That is the thing that matters, not what I was, not what I have been.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.580]   Do what the apostle did, therefore.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.700]   If the enemy is attacking you along this line, turn to him and say, "What you are saying
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.900]   is perfectly true.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.020]   I was that, but what I am interested in is not what I was, but what I am.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.200]   I am what I am by the grace of God."
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.260]   The second deduction is this, and they are all simple and they are all obvious.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:29:00.540]   It is not the time of your entry into the kingdom that matters, but the fact that you
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.260]   are in the kingdom.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.660]   That is the thing that matters.
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:12.780]   How foolish it is to mourn the fact that we were not in before and to allow that to rob
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.900]   us of the things that we might be enjoying now.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:23.980]   It is like somebody going into a great exhibition, but there is a long queue and this person
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:30.000]   has come rather late, has not got up in time or something else.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.660]   This person arrives at the exhibition and has to wait a long time.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.660]   Lots of people get in.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.780]   He is about the last to get in.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.660]   What do you think of such a man who, now having got in through the door, is in a position
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.820]   to look at the paintings or the sculpture or whatever it is, simply stands just inside
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.220]   the door saying, "What a shame that I was not the first to get in.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.540]   What a pity that I was not in quite right."
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.980]   You are laughing at it very rightly, but may I point out to you that you are laughing at
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.980]   yourself.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   That is precisely what you are doing spiritually.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.140]   "Oh, that I have left it so long!"
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.820]   My friend, begin to enjoy the pictures.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.820]   Look at the sculpture.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.820]   Enjoy the treasures.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.380]   What does it matter when you came in?
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:16.260]   The fact is that you are in and it is there open, all of it before you.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.220]   It is not the time of your entry.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.700]   Go back to your 20th of Matthew again.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.620]   They were the last, the eleventh hour, but they were in.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.180]   That is the thing that counts.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.300]   They had been taken hold of.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   They had been implied.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   He had called them.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.300]   They are in.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:38.540]   It is being in that matters, not when you came in or how you came in.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.220]   I could elaborate this at great length.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.180]   One so constantly has to be saying this.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:49.340]   It is not even the mode or the manner of your conversion that matters.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.940]   What matters is the fact that you are converted.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.620]   But people will sit down and worry about the way they have come in.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.340]   They have not had somebody else's experience or it did not happen in this precise way or
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.340]   manner.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.020]   It does not matter.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.960]   What matters is, are you in?
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.380]   If you are in, rejoice in it and forget that you were ever out.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.260]   The time element is quite unimportant.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.900]   But I must go further.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:20.300]   I suggest that this condition of spiritual depression, because of this particular thing,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:26.900]   rarely is due to the fact that this person is still morbidly and sinfully preoccupied
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.980]   with self.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:34.460]   I said just now that we have to be brutal with this condition and it has got to be said.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.860]   The real trouble with this person is still self.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.860]   What are they doing?
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.860]   Well, this is what they are doing.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.540]   They are still judging themselves instead of leaving it to him.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:50.660]   You see, there they are lashing themselves and scarifying themselves because they were
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.780]   so late and so long.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.340]   And they are condemning themselves.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.700]   They appear to be very humble.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.220]   They appear to be full of contrition.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   They are not humble at all.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.220]   It is mock modesty.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.220]   It is self-concern.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.140]   They are judging themselves instead of leaving it to him.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.780]   Listen to Paul saying the same thing in the fourth chapter of this same epistle.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.620]   "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.620]   God.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.260]   Moreover, it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:27.740]   But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of men's judgment.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:33.740]   Yea, and this is one of the greatest things Paul ever said, yea, I judge not mine own
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:34.740]   self.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.380]   For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not hereby justified.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:45.340]   But he that judgeth me is the Lord."
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.340]   As Christians we must leave our judgment to him.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.380]   He is the judge.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:56.820]   And you have no right to waste his time nor your own time and energy in condemning yourself
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.660]   and lashing yourself.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.660]   Forget yourself.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.980]   Leave the judgment to him.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.700]   Get on with the work.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.020]   It suggests this morbid preoccupation with self in the matter of judgment.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:16.180]   Not only that, you see, it indicates a proner still to think in terms of amassing merit
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.460]   and of what we can do.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.540]   Here this person comes to us in this apparent modesty and says, "You know, if only I had
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.740]   come in sooner.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.060]   Not a lot of work I could have done."
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.660]   And so on and so forth.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.580]   What this person is really indicating is that he or she might have done so much and the
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.580]   kingdom would have benefited so much.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.700]   You see, it's amassing merit.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.260]   The number of years counts.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.980]   I could have built up this tremendous amount of credit and of merit.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.540]   It's quite wrong.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.980]   That's utterly false.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:53.340]   The whole parable our Lord spoke in the 20th of Matthew was designed to demolish that argument.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.900]   We must be rid of that.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.300]   We must cease to think in terms of what we can do and what we can build up.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.660]   The time element of necessity introduces that.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.460]   But let me put this positively as I close.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.900]   I have said part of the trouble of these people is that they are still morbidly preoccupied
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.900]   with themselves.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:20.820]   They haven't learned that as Christians they should finish with self, deny self, take up
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:26.220]   the cross and follow him, leave yourself in his hands utterly and absolutely past, present
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   and future.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.060]   Ah yes, but what's it due to?
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.340]   Why are they thus morbidly preoccupied with themselves?
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.860]   The answer is of course that they are not sufficiently occupied with him.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.700]   And that is the final explanation of this condition.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:49.000]   It is our failure to know him and his ways as we should know them.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.140]   My dear friends, if we only spent more of our time in looking at him, we'd soon forget
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.140]   ourselves.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:35:00.540]   I said just now, if you are in that exhibition, don't stand at the door bemoaning the fact,
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.140]   look at the pictures, look at the treasures.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.860]   Oh, let me take that into its spiritual content.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.180]   You've come into the Christian life very well then.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.620]   Stop looking at yourself and begin to enjoy him.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   What's the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian?
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.180]   St. Paul in the second epistle to the Corinthians says it's this, that the non-Christian is
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.340]   a man who looks at Christ and at God with a veil over his eyes and over his heart and
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.780]   he can't see what's a Christian.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.820]   This is his description.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:39.060]   But we all, every one of us as Christians, we all, with open face, the veil is gone,
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:46.100]   beholding as in a clasp the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.100]   to glory.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.060]   That's the Christian.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.180]   He spends his time in looking at him, in gazing upon him, in meditating.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:57.900]   He's so enraptured by the sight of him, he's forgotten himself, his past, his everything
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.900]   else.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.400]   That's the trouble.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.220]   If you were only more interested in Christ, you'd be less interested in yourself, my
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.900]   friend.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.700]   Begin to look at him, gaze upon him with this open face.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.500]   And then go on to learn that in his kingdom what matters is not the length of your service
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:22.780]   but your attitude towards him and your desire to please him.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.740]   He doesn't count service as other people do.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.420]   Go back again to the parable.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.820]   He's interested in the heart.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.980]   We are interested in time.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.340]   We're all clocking in and counting the time we've spent and the work we've done,
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.780]   like those first men who went in.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.740]   All this time we've spent, we all tend to do that.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.100]   And then if we haven't gone in at the very beginning, we say, "Oh, we haven't done
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.500]   this, we've missed all this time."
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.900]   Our Lord isn't interested in your work and mine in that way.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.020]   He's interested in the heart.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.260]   It's the widow's might that interests him, you know.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.340]   It wasn't the amount of money.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.340]   It was the sacrifice.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.940]   It was the woman's desire.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.660]   It was the woman's heart.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.660]   And it's the same everywhere.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.020]   It's the same there in the 20th of Matthew.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.420]   He gives a penny to the people who've only been in an hour.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   Why?
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.460]   Well, he's interested in the devotion.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.340]   And that was the case of Paul as he defines it here.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:19.140]   Last of all, last of all, he revealed himself unto me also.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.660]   I'm a sort of ectopic, but thank God that doesn't make any difference.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.220]   His grace covers it all.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.740]   By the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.260]   He's not interested in time.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.140]   He's interested in relationship.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.180]   And that brings me to the last point.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:44.500]   The thing you see that matters in the kingdom is nothing but the grace of God.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.460]   That's the whole point of the parable, isn't it?
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.260]   He's got a different way of doing things.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.860]   He doesn't see as men do.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.420]   He doesn't compute as they do.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.460]   Is thine I evil because I am good?
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.100]   It's all grace from beginning to end.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.620]   You see, the last people who went in were given the penny exactly as the first.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.580]   They were given the same wage, the same amount, the last as the first.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.460]   And indeed he impresses it and drives his point home by saying this, that many that
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:19.620]   are last shall be first, and the first last.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:25.860]   We've got to cease thinking in this carnal, human, fleshly, temporal manner.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:31.420]   In the kingdom of God and of Christ, the standpoint is that of grace, and it cuts across all our
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.740]   rules and regulations.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.460]   It's his grace that matters.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.940]   By the grace of God I am what I am.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.820]   So stop looking back at what you haven't done, at the years you've missed, or anything like
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:55.700]   that, and realize that in his kingdom and under his grace, you who have come in last
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:02.300]   may find yourself to your own amazement and astonishment one day as first.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.620]   And like the people in the parable at the end of Matthew 25, you'll say, "When did
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.620]   I do this?
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.460]   When did I do that?"
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.220]   He knows, he sees, his grace is sufficient.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:19.900]   Very well then, I close with an exhortation from the Old Testament.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:31.540]   In the morning, therefore, sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hen, for
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:37.220]   thou knowest not whether they shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.620]   shall be alike good.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.340]   I wonder whether I'm speaking to somebody who's spent a lifetime outside Christ and
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.340]   in sin and in the world.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.340]   Somebody who's come in at an old age and is tempted of Satan in the way I've been
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.340]   describing.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.500]   My friend, my word to you is this.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:01.460]   In the evening, the evening of your life, withhold not your hen.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:06.980]   In this marvelous kingdom of grace which is miraculous and supernatural, you may find
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:10.100]   on the day of judgment that you've got a much bigger crop than those people who were
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.020]   saved in their youth.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.900]   What a glorious gospel.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.260]   This is the great word today.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.500]   Here's a gospel for the aged, for the octogenarians, the nonagenarians.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   It doesn't matter.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:28.620]   Age is irrelevant, and it's unscriptural to emphasize it as we do.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.420]   In the morning, sow thy seed.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:38.500]   Yes, but with equal force, I would say, in the evening withhold not thine hen.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:45.100]   And then, perhaps one of the most comforting and wonderful things that is found anywhere
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:52.980]   in scripture, it was spoken through the prophet Joel as he was given that great vision and
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:58.300]   understanding of the kingdom of grace and of Christ that was to come.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.700]   This was the word he was given to Utah.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:09.980]   I will restore the years that the locust hath eaten.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   He's promised to do it.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.220]   He can do it.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:17.740]   The wasted years, the barren years, the years when the locust and the canker worm and the
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.580]   caterpillar and all these others have devoured and destroyed everything.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.580]   There was nothing left.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.940]   It was out of barren waste and wilderness.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.180]   There's nothing there.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:31.980]   He says, I will restore the years that the locust hath eaten.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.820]   You see, if you think of it in terms of what you can do with your strength and power, well,
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.980]   time is of the essence of the contract, isn't it?
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.980]   But we're in a realm where that doesn't matter.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:47.220]   He comes in, and he can give us a crop in one year that'll make up for ten.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:52.020]   I will restore the years that the locust hath eaten.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.500]   That's your master.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.180]   That's your savior.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.180]   That's your God.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:01.300]   So I say in the light of this, never look back again.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.120]   Never waste your time in the present.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   Never waste your energy.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   Forget the past.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:13.220]   Leave it and rejoice in the fact that you are what you are by the grace of God and that
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:19.940]   in the divine alchemy of his marvelous grace, you may yet have the greatest surprise of
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:25.700]   your life and of your existence and find that even in your case, it will come to pass that
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.140]   the last shall be first.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:38.220]   Praise God for the fact that you are what you are and that you're in the kingdom.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.060]   Amen.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:43.980]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
