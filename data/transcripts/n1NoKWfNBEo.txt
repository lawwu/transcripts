[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   How do we determine the monetary value
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.560]   of our personal skills and gifts?
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.100]   And what are they worth to other Christians?
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.840]   This is a really practical question for a lot of you,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.640]   applicable to anyone in a local church
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.440]   who has a skill set or a gifting that benefits others.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.560]   Today's question comes particularly from a listener
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.680]   in Los Angeles who writes this.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.880]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for the APJ podcast.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.600]   My question is a reoccurring heart issue for my life.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.080]   I am a graphic designer.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.800]   I'm trying to live out my gift according to 1 Peter 4.10,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.920]   as each has received a gift, use it to serve one another
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.360]   as good stewards of God's varied grace.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   How can I obey this verse without feeling resentment
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.940]   and bitterness towards people, Christians and non-Christians
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.480]   who mainly contact me because I have a skill
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.640]   that can fulfill their need,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.160]   but who use my skills and never pay me for them?
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.780]   I often feel used and deemed worthy
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.540]   of quote unquote friendship by what I can do,
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.040]   not who I am.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.080]   My assumption is that if I did not possess
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.880]   this graphic design gift,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.980]   these people would never contact me.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.040]   How do we think about the value of skills that are God given
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.800]   and about the right of making a little bit of money
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.120]   from these God given gifts to make a living?
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.880]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.440]   That's a really good question
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   that many Christians need to think about
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.440]   because I have seen professionals in the church
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.120]   misused when people unthinkingly,
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.240]   I think it's usually unthinkingly,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800]   take advantage of the church family connections
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.680]   to get services that most people are paying for,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.280]   to get them free.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.040]   Like a doctor or a lawyer or a plumber
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.520]   or a carpenter or a designer.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.360]   And people just ask them to do little jobs
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.360]   or little consultations say in the evening or after church.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.400]   That's their gift without even thinking
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   how this may be unbiblical by mooching or exploiting.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.280]   And I'll come back to those words,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.680]   mooching and exploiting in just a minute.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.360]   So the first thing that I would say about the text
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.440]   of 1 Peter 4, 10 and 11,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.680]   is that they're not speaking directly
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.840]   about professional services,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.280]   but spiritual gifts in the church.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.800]   It says, "As each has received a gift,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.600]   use it to serve one another
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.560]   as good stewards of God's varied grace.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.680]   Whoever speaks, like preaching or teaching,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.040]   as the oracles of God,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.960]   whoever serves as one who serves in the strength
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   that God supplies in order that in everything,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.720]   to him belong glory and dominion forever and ever.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.400]   Amen."
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.320]   But even though I think these are directly
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.440]   referring to spiritual gifts in the church,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.920]   some of them are remunerated in the church.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.560]   For example, when Paul says that some elders
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.600]   who have the gift of teaching should be paid,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.240]   that's elevating some of these
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.080]   to the point of professional skills.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.240]   Let the elders who rule well,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.360]   this is 1 Timothy 5, 17,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.960]   let the elders who rule well
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.400]   be considered worthy of double honor,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.360]   especially those who labor in preaching and teaching,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.280]   for the scripture says,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   "You shall not muzzle an ox
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.840]   when it's treading out the grain,"
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   and the laborer deserves his wages.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.920]   So I think some of those spiritual gifts
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.240]   rise to the level of vocational callings,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.760]   which Paul says should be paid.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.800]   And that means I think it is fair
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.680]   to draw some principles out of these texts
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.080]   that do in fact relate to the question of natural gifts
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.040]   or natural skills that a person has
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.680]   and which they use to make a living.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.120]   One principle is this,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   God intends for us to work in order to make a living
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   and not be dependent on others when not necessary.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.760]   Here's where I get that, 1 Thessalonians 4, 11,
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   "Aspire to live quietly, mind your own affairs,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.080]   work with your hands as we instructed you
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.000]   so that you may walk properly before outsiders
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.560]   and be dependent on no one."
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   So one of the functions of work is to make enough money
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   so that you don't have to depend on others inappropriately.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   So it's right to be paid for your work,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   the laborer deserves his wages,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.320]   don't muzzle the ox while he's treading out the grain.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.640]   Now, this does not mean,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.920]   I don't want to overstate the case,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   this does not mean there's no room for merciful generosity
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.680]   to help those in need with your professional skill.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.640]   I mean, Christians all over the world do this, right?
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.800]   Dentists will take his Fridays off and go to an inner city
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   and set up a little clinic and give free help to teeth.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.040]   That's beautiful, I'm not at all discouraging that.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.840]   In fact, Paul says that one of the reasons for working
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   to make a living is so that we might have something to give.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.920]   (laughs)
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.640]   It's what he says in Ephesians 4, 28, he says,
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.880]   "Let the thief no longer steal,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.480]   but rather let him labor doing honest work with his hands
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   so that he may have something to share with anyone in need."
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.120]   So I'm not saying that those with special skills and gifts
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.920]   should never use them freely and generously to help others.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.120]   All the commands to be generous, to give to the needy,
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.040]   even to be willing to be taken advantage of, Jesus says,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.520]   they're all still in the Bible.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.960]   But what our friend is drawing our attention to
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.480]   in asking this question is that there is more
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.140]   than one kind of teaching in the Bible
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.880]   and neither should cancel out the other.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.680]   There's the command to give freely to the needy
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.680]   and there's the command to earn your living
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   so that you and your family can eat and be clothed.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.640]   So work to get to use and work to get to give
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.360]   are both in the Bible, right?
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.840]   Go to work so that you can get,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.320]   so that you can use it to put a roof over your head
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   and work and get so that you have lots to be generous with
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   and help others.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.060]   They're both in the Bible
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.320]   and that's the challenge of love and wisdom
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.480]   that our graphic designer in this question
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.300]   is challenged with.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.540]   But those in his network, his friends, his church,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.120]   I think they need to hear another message from the Bible,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.080]   namely the message found in 2 Thessalonians 3.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.360]   Remember, some Christians in the church in Thessalonica
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   had become seized by a kind of hysteria
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.080]   about the nearness of the second coming of Christ
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.040]   and they had stopped working
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.380]   and started to live in idleness
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.720]   expecting the momentary return of Jesus
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.480]   while mooching off of those
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.040]   who kept on working for a living.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.720]   So here's how Paul responds to that.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.800]   Verse six of 2 Thessalonians 3.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.360]   Now we command you brothers
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.560]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.720]   that you keep away from any brother
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.680]   who is walking in idleness
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.200]   and not in accord with the tradition
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   that you receive from us.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.540]   For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.720]   because we were not idle when we were with you
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.040]   That's amazing.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.000]   Paul was so jealous not to give the impression
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.540]   that he could exploit the work of others
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.960]   while he lived in idleness
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.840]   that he didn't eat anybody's bread without paying for it.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   Amazing.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.380]   But with toil and labor, we worked night and day
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.940]   that we might not be a burden to any of you.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.920]   Now that's the message some of the believers need to hear
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.220]   who are taking advantage of people's services
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.700]   without paying for them.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.500]   It was not because we do not have the right,
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.640]   this is Paul continuing in verse nine,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   it was not because we do not have the right
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040]   but rather to give you ourselves as an example to imitate.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.460]   For even when we were with you,
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.320]   we would give you this command,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.940]   if anyone's not willing to work, let him not eat.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.860]   For we hear that some of you are walking in idleness,
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.420]   not busy at work, but busy bodies.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.740]   So the point that I'm drawing out of that text
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.940]   for our question is the network of Christians
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.660]   who are taking advantage of the work of others
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.100]   to get something that most people are paying for,
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.520]   they need to be taught, don't do that.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   That is don't presume upon that, be willing to pay.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.560]   If the skilled person wants to make a special gift to you,
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.980]   that's his to decide, not yours to expect.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.580]   And to the graphic designer himself or herself,
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.100]   I couldn't tell which we're dealing with here,
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.760]   to him or her, I would say,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.540]   pray that God would direct people's hearts in the right way.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.180]   In other words, pray for people,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.020]   that he would wake up to what they're doing.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.900]   And then perhaps talk to your pastor or teachers
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.380]   in the church to see if they can begin to apply
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.360]   the scriptures to this issue for a while in the church
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.080]   so that there's a culture in the church
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.040]   that includes both generosity and even willingness
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.240]   to be taken advantage of for Christ's sake,
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.240]   but also a sense that we must not mooch off of,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.600]   we must not exploit those who are hard at work
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.740]   making a living, but rather take responsibility
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.440]   for our own needs instead of depending on others
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.420]   to give us freebies.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.640]   Behind both those aspects of church culture,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.560]   generosity and responsibility,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.940]   those are the two poles I'm talking about,
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.960]   behind both of those aspects of church culture
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.080]   is the grace of the Lord Jesus.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   He gives the grace to work and he gives the grace to give,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.660]   and he gets the glory both ways.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.400]   - Yeah, really good balance here, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.740]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.780]   the authentic Christian life,
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.260]   what distinguishes the Christian life
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.660]   from the non-Christian life?
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.500]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke,
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.300]   and we're gonna find out on Monday.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.200]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.780]   (upbeat music)
