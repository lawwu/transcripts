[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.280]   All right, let's do one more question about deep work.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.200]   This one, appropriately enough, comes from Deep Academic.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.160]   I think if your parents named you that,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.440]   it would be a shame if you became like a YouTube
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.120]   influencer.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.560]   So I guess you didn't have any options
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.180]   about what your job was going to be once your parents named you
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.960]   Deep Academic.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.080]   Here's a question, how do you handle paper rejection
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.040]   as an academic?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.800]   How do you help your students get over it?
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.960]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.480]   I struggle with it.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480]   Non-academics don't realize this.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.000]   They don't realize how incredibly competitive
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.240]   academia is, especially sort of tenure track R1 research
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.920]   institutions.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680]   There's these venues in which you
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680]   can publish your papers that are very stratified.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.560]   And it is incredibly hard to get your papers published
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.800]   in the good venues.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   It's very competitive.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.960]   Most things get rejected.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.040]   So you're constantly in this competition.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.080]   I think the public sometimes has this view of academia
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.120]   where A, they call it teaching, which, again,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.900]   research-oriented academics, it is a source of frustration
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.080]   that their job is described as teaching.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   It's like if you're a professional basketball player
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.680]   and people were like, oh, yeah, you do leg pressing.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.160]   And you're like, well, yeah, I do leg pressing in the gym
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.720]   as part of my training for being a really good basketball
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840]   player, which is incredibly competitive and hard.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.720]   The hardest thing in academia is trying
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.160]   to publish in these competitive venues.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.280]   It's intellectual warfare, the very smartest people
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.680]   in the world fighting for a small number of slots.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.440]   10% to 15% of what is submitted is going to get accepted.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.200]   It's very difficult. So you get a lot of rejections.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.360]   And it's competitive and it's difficult.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.440]   I struggle with this.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.560]   I've gone through different phases in my career.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.160]   So when I was a graduate student,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.280]   my pace of publication would be much less, maybe one or two
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.520]   papers a year when I first got going.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.760]   And it would hit me hard when a paper would get rejected
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.960]   because it's all I had worked on for a few months.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.240]   And I have notes in my Moleskines I can go find
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.120]   of me reacting to rejections.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.920]   I took them hard.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.320]   But then as I hit my stride as a junior faculty member,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.520]   the wheel started to click.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.240]   And I published a lot.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.560]   And I really got a lot of stuff accepted.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.520]   So it was a nice golden period where I published a ton
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.640]   of papers, got tenure early, distinguished professorship.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.960]   Things were really rolling well.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.040]   I was publishing four or five papers a month.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440]   And then I, more recently--
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.160]   I've talked about this on the show-- the pandemic
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.600]   knocked me back to the world of not submitting as much,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.320]   but way more rejections for the small number of things
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.120]   I was submitting.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.400]   So I'm back into that world of rejection.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.040]   Briefly, what happened there for people who are non-academics,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.440]   again, because it's so competitive,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.760]   there is an incredibly high quality threshold.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.440]   And so what happened to me during the pandemic
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.360]   is two things happened.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.520]   One, I got knocked out of my collaboration cycles
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.360]   because I have collaborators around the world
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.800]   and we meet in person twice a year.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.640]   And they're top-notch collaborators.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   I've known most of them since I was 22 years old at MIT.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.840]   And they're all over the world, but we meet twice a year.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.400]   Usually, there's a time in the summer for whatever.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   There's a conference we all go to.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.440]   And one of my close collaborators,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.400]   longtime collaborators, comes back to DC every summer
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   as family's here.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.520]   And we bring in other collaborators
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   and we all get together.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.160]   And that's where most of the ideas
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.440]   were generated that we then write papers on.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.960]   Turns out, if you don't have those meetings,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.440]   as happened during the pandemic, you
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.960]   don't have the good ideas to work on.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.480]   And two, I just didn't have the time.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.320]   I just had-- it was the typical impacts a lot of people had,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.480]   especially people with kids.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.320]   With the pandemic, I didn't have as much time
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.160]   to spend on research.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.480]   So I went to about 50% effort.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.120]   The issue is in competitive academia,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.280]   50% effort doesn't mean, oh, you publish 50% less papers.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.360]   It means any paper you write, the quality
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.200]   falls just enough that they're all below the acceptance
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.040]   threshold.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   And so I did that for a year.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.520]   I basically didn't publish anything.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.480]   And then I realized, oh, I should probably just
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.160]   put all of my energy into less papers.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.840]   And last year, I published a very nice paper
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.600]   where I put my energy just--
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.800]   if I can't have as much time to spend on this,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.040]   let me put all the time into one paper
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.080]   because I can't fall below it.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.840]   But anyways, I've been really struggling with it.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.680]   It's the lowest publication year last year.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.320]   It was the lowest publication year
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   I've ever had as a professional academic because
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.480]   of the pandemic.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.320]   I still struggle with it, the academic.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   I think it's hard.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.480]   The best thing you can do is tune up your process.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.960]   So after some hard rejections, tune up the process.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.520]   What's missing here?
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.280]   What do I need to do?
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.880]   What would I need to do to not get rejected as often?
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.600]   Do I need better collaboration, more work, more whatever it is?
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.280]   Figure out how do I tune up my process.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.200]   And by the way, you can decide, I don't want to do that.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   I don't have time to do that.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   That's not where I am in my career.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.080]   But be clear about it.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.520]   And then two, do the real work.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.400]   So there's no shortcuts around it.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.880]   You probably just have to do the stuff that's hard.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.000]   Read the papers, understand what's going on,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.600]   push your ideas farther than you think they need to be pushed.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   Do the work that's required.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.480]   Tune up your process.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.400]   It's the best you can do.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.680]   And then keep in mind there's some stochasticity too.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.960]   There is going to be some luck.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.200]   And that should even itself out.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   But anyways, I'm with you.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.160]   I came off a five-year period of hot shot publishing
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.040]   down to nothing.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.400]   And now I'm crawling back out of that,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.280]   but carefully because I don't know
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.400]   that I want to go back to hot shot computer science
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   publishing.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.360]   There's so much other interesting stuff
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.600]   happening in the world now, especially
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.960]   my involvement in digital ethics and some of the public-facing
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.740]   writing I'm doing.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.360]   So I'm rebuilding my life from scratch academically.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480]   Then we'll have more publications than I just had,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.840]   but maybe not as much as I used to.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.760]   It's hard.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.240]   I feel your pain.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.280]   Tune process, do real work, recognize there's luck.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.600]   And otherwise, try not to obsess too much about it
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.800]   because, man, paper rejections is tough.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
