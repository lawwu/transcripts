[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Again, maybe another dumb question, but--
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   - There are no such things as dumb questions, Tony.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   - There you go.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.940]   But what is money?
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.080]   So you've mentioned credit and money.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.480]   Another thing that if I just zoom out
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.440]   from an alien perspective and look at human civilization,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.760]   it's incredible that we've created a thing
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.400]   that's not, that only works because currency,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.500]   because we all agree it has value.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.360]   So I guess my question is,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.960]   how do you think about money as this emergent phenomenon?
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.760]   And what do you think is the future of money?
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.500]   You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.600]   What do you think is its history and future?
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.360]   How do you think about money?
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.120]   - There are two things that money is for.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.840]   It's a medium of exchange, and it's a storehold of wealth.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.680]   - Yes.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.880]   - That's, so money, so you could say something's
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.560]   a medium of exchange, and then you could say
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.320]   is it a storehold of wealth, okay?
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   So those, and money is that vehicle that is those things,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.840]   and can be used to pay off your debt.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.040]   So when you have a debt and you provide it,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.880]   it pays off your debt.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.760]   So that's that process.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   - And it's, I apologize to interrupt,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.120]   but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   when everybody recognizes it to be of value.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.680]   - That's right. - Right.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.440]   - And so you see in the history around the world,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.360]   in which they had as money these big stones,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.800]   and literally they were taking a boat,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.160]   this big carved stone, and they were taking it
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.560]   from one of the islands to the other,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   and it sank, the piece of this big stone piece of money
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.120]   that they had, and it went to the bottom,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.560]   and they still perceived it as having value,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.960]   so that it was, even though it was in the bottom,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.840]   and it's this big hunk of rock,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   the fact that somebody owned it,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.920]   they would say, oh, I'll own it for this and that.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.440]   I've seen beads in different places,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.840]   shells converted to this in mediums of exchange,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840]   and when we look at what we've got,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   you're exactly right, it is the notion that
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.160]   if I give it to you, I can then take it,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.880]   and I can buy something with it,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.480]   and that's, so it's a matter of perception, okay.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.000]   And then we go through then the history of money,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   and the vulnerabilities of money,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.800]   and what we have is, through history,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.840]   there's been two types of money,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   those that are claims on something of value,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.600]   like the connection to gold or something.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.440]   - That's right.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.640]   - That would be, or they just are money
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.800]   without any connection, and then we have a system now,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.900]   which is a fiat monetary system.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.640]   So that's what money is.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   Then it will last as long as it's kept a value,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.080]   and it works that way.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.760]   So let's say central banks, when they get in the position
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.200]   of like they owe a lot of money,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.760]   like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.680]   and they also are a bond, and they have the printing press
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   to print the money and get out of that,
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.480]   and you have a lot of people might be in that position,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.440]   then you can print it, and then it could be devalued
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.880]   in there, and so history has shown, forget about today,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.120]   history has shown that no currency has,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   every currency has either ended as being a currency,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.920]   or devalued as a currency over periods of time,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440]   long periods of time.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.560]   So it evolves, and it changes, but everybody needs
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.320]   that medium of exchange, and everybody needs
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   that storehold of wealth, so it keeps changing
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.460]   what is money over a period of time.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.620]   (silence)
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.780]   (silence)
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.940]   (silence)
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.100]   (silence)
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.260]   (silence)
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.420]   (silence)
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.580]   (silence)
