[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.600]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 167.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:18.040]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.080]   No, Jesse again.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.480]   No, I actually just talked to Jesse
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.600]   and he gave me permission to update you on what's going on.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.160]   He's fine, here's what happened.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   Last week, he came for our weekly recording session.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.400]   We do rapid COVID testing here at the Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   At least we're doing it now during the period
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.920]   where Omicron is high in the DC region.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.320]   And our courageous esteemed producer tested positive,
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.800]   so he had to go home.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.720]   He's almost done with his isolation period.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.680]   So we considered, why don't we just record
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.320]   a little bit late this week, so that he could be here.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.960]   But my schedule was such that I needed to stick
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   with the existing schedule.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640]   So it just was bad timing that,
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.500]   we record two episodes at a time.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.160]   Last week's recording session was actually pretty close
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.440]   to this week's recording session.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.640]   So one COVID isolation period covered
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.720]   two weeks worth of recording sessions.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.760]   But anyways, he will be out of isolation soon.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.360]   He'll be back in the studio for next week's episodes.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.560]   He's fine by the way, he feels fine.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.640]   He's exercising all the time.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.560]   I just saw him today.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.920]   We had a weekly production meeting outside.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.840]   So we're nice and safe, but I can attest
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   that he is looking and feeling fine.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480]   Just working remotely on the show
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.280]   and we'll be back next week.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.640]   All right, speaking of the show,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.080]   we have an exciting announcement.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.360]   Early on, early on in the history of the show,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.860]   I began talking about this dream of we need video.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.020]   And it became almost a running joke on the podcast
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.240]   because week after week, I would say video is coming soon.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.400]   I'm recording things, video is coming soon.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.360]   And it never did because it turns out actually,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.000]   it's quite difficult to get this right.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.760]   And I wanted to get it right, but we are finally there.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.800]   As you hear this episode,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.240]   Deep Questions video is available.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.860]   You can go find it right now.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.960]   Now I'll explain what video recording,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.160]   why we're recording it, our philosophy,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.280]   the plans for the video,
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.760]   but just so to get the logistics out of the way,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   right now the videos are being hosted on YouTube.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.080]   We don't yet have a personalized URL
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.380]   because you have to, it's a chicken and the egg problem.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.500]   I think you have to be around for a certain number of days
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.160]   and have a certain number of subscribers
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.560]   before they'll give you a simple URL.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.320]   So what we've done is two things.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.760]   One, there's a link in the show notes for this episode
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.000]   for the YouTube page
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680]   that contains the Deep Questions videos.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.480]   Also, there's a post on my blog.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.280]   So if you go to calnewport.com/blog,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.380]   you'll see a post there that has a link to it.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.160]   All right, so what are we doing with video?
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.800]   Well, the idea was to videotape
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.120]   basically every question and deep dive,
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   and then release each of those as a standalone video.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.620]   Now, the reason why we're doing this,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.200]   and I really wanna emphasize this,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.380]   is that I am not a YouTuber.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.780]   I have no interest in being a YouTuber.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.200]   If I did, I would probably spend a lot more time
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.760]   on this podcast talking about Minecraft.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.660]   I do not need people to smash the subscribe button
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.020]   and click the bell and to get notifications.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.680]   I have no interest in making a living on YouTube.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.160]   I have no interest in trying to use YouTube ads
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   to make money.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.520]   The whole point here is that I picked up pretty quickly
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.160]   into being a podcaster,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.500]   that for this format of show,
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.520]   where I cover a lot of different material,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.720]   so it's not just interviews,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.180]   but as we do a lot of different questions,
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.800]   the biggest issue is that it is difficult
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   to bookmark, save, pull out,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.120]   come back to just one piece of content from the show.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.600]   If there's a particular question, you say,
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.280]   you know what, that really applies to me,
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.120]   and I really like that answer, and I wanna remember that,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.460]   or I wanna send that to someone.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.200]   It's very hard when all you have
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.080]   is an hour-long audio recording file.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.740]   So my whole idea was if we have a standalone video
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.740]   for every question, now you can go and save a question.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.880]   You bookmark it.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.560]   You can email it to someone, like, oh, hey,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.320]   remember how we were talking about Zettelkasten?
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.360]   Well, Cal just did a thing on it, here's the clip.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.720]   You can keep whatever you wanna do with it,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.680]   but I just think it's a way
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.000]   of extending the podcast technology
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.320]   so that it's more useful to you.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.080]   So our goal is every question to have a standalone video,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.000]   and we'll see if we meet that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.560]   Also, every deep dive, let's make those separate,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.480]   and we're recording full episodes as well.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.620]   So if you're interested in what does it look like here
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.220]   in the Deep Work HQ, what does Jesse look like,
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.160]   what does Cal look like, what's actually going on,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.320]   we are releasing the full episodes as video too,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.360]   because it turns out that some people
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.720]   prefer to watch podcasts instead of listening to them,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.880]   which makes sense to me.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.380]   There is something oddly compelling
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.520]   about watching people talk.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.940]   You think it would be boring,
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.200]   but if there's a video of a podcast they like,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.400]   and I have the time to see it, I like to watch the video.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.680]   So we're recording the whole thing.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.440]   That's why we have shifted the format
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.880]   to a live format more recently
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.360]   so it's not cut up so we can actually film the whole thing.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.960]   Right, so anyways, that is the idea,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.760]   is that you can now grab any question,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.580]   any question you hear on this podcast today that you like,
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.500]   or from recent episodes,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.400]   you should be able to go and find it.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.720]   You know, it takes a little while to edit,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.280]   so probably what we'll be doing is videos
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.920]   from each week's episodes will be trickled out
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.020]   a few at a time until they've all been released.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.980]   Okay, second point about this.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.380]   I have a mixed relationship with YouTube.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.380]   I don't know YouTube well.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.660]   I don't spend a lot of time on YouTube,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.940]   but I know some people have trouble with it.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.580]   It's not the same as social media
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.900]   where you are posting stuff and people are reacting to it.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.300]   It doesn't necessarily have that same,
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.080]   I'm gonna make you feel, chemically speaking,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.100]   just terrible at a moment's notice
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.740]   in the way that Twitter can do,
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.740]   in the way that Facebook can do,
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.860]   but it has an addictive nature, so I hear,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.780]   because of these recommendation links.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.940]   I went to watch a Cal video,
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.700]   and then I saw a recommendation that was interesting,
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.220]   and then I saw another recommendation that's interesting,
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.460]   and it's Nazis, right?
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.460]   So you go down these rabbit holes of recommendation links,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.380]   and they bring you to weird places.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.540]   So some people don't care about that.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.580]   They go on YouTube to, like, I'm looking up this thing.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.420]   They have no problems.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.580]   Like I talk about in my book, "Digital Minimalism,"
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.140]   use YouTube like a library, not a TV channel.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.100]   "Hey, I heard a question I liked
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.540]   "in episode 167 of Cal's podcast.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.940]   "Let me go just get that episode."
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.500]   But some people have a hard time with it.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.520]   So let me tell you about phase two of this vision.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.820]   Concurrently, with all the work we were doing
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.500]   to get video ready, which among other things,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.660]   meant we had to rebuild out this studio,
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.100]   light this studio, have the cameras
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.660]   going through switchers.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.500]   I discovered at some point,
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.940]   no way I was gonna do this on my own.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.580]   It's a big part of why we brought Jesse on,
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.820]   so we have someone who can actually produce,
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.660]   watch the videos in real time, produce them, et cetera.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.720]   A lot went into that.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.420]   Concurrently to all of those efforts,
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.580]   which have been going on pretty seriously
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.180]   since the last summer, I've also been working
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.180]   with a fantastic branding web development technology company
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.600]   that actually does quite a bit of work
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.060]   with the music industry.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.140]   But anyways, they have been working with me
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.180]   also since last summer.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.180]   We're developing a portal, a standalone website.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.180]   So not calnewport.com, but a different website
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.580]   that is going to be a collection place
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.860]   for all of this content.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.500]   So it's where the podcast will live.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.900]   Each podcast episode will have its own dedicated page
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.620]   where there'll be a player for that podcast.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.700]   The description show notes will be there
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.700]   and separate videos for every single question
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.020]   will be right there on the page as well
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.900]   that you can just watch right there.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.020]   All of the videos that we record and release to YouTube
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.060]   will also be accessible through this portal
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.220]   when we launch it.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.660]   And they're gonna be arranged
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.900]   in Netflix style horizontal carousels.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.180]   So it's a place you can go that is free
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.780]   from the YouTube algorithm.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.740]   It's just the video setup and carousels
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.400]   in exactly the way that Jesse and I want them.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.900]   This portal when it launches
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.100]   is completely mobile responsive.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.360]   So you can load it up on your iPad,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.420]   you can load it up on your phone
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.660]   and it's just like you're using
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.060]   the Netflix app on your phone.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.860]   You can just scroll through the different categories,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.020]   their horizontal carousels,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.500]   oh, I wanna watch that video.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.140]   On the back end, the videos are still for now
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.140]   hosted on YouTube,
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.620]   but they get sucked into this custom built ecosystem
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.420]   we're creating.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.700]   So you can listen to the podcast,
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.100]   watch videos, et cetera,
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.140]   read my newsletter, all that stuff.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.540]   You can do it in a environment that we're custom building
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.300]   to be free of those distractions,
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.840]   to be free of the addictive impulse.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.400]   And so we're probably about,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.360]   look, I hate to predict,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.960]   I'm always so wrong with predictions.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.120]   Right, how many times did I say,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.040]   okay, we're gonna have video next week,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.960]   cut to six months later,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.880]   but we're probably one to two months out
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.900]   from the portal launching.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.120]   All right, if that makes sense.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.000]   Most of it's built,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.880]   then we had to get the videos up and running
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.660]   and then we can do the final testing.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.840]   So knock on wood,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.500]   that portal will be up soon.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.920]   All right, so anyways, that's the exciting announcement.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.640]   I think this is a important step forward for the podcast.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.400]   The ability to view, save, and share with other people
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.100]   individual questions or deep dive discussions,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.480]   I think is needed.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   It was needed.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.720]   And so keep your eyes out for that.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.000]   Link in the show description.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.480]   You can also find a link for the videos
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.640]   at calnewport.com/blog.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.120]   All right, so that's enough announcements.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.860]   I would want to move on now with our questions.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.320]   And as always, we will start with questions
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.180]   about the deep work.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.120]   The deep work, man, I'm tired.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.240]   I need some more sleep.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.280]   Deep work.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.480]   All right, question number one.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.420]   Question number one about deep work.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.840]   This comes from Joshua.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   Joshua asks, how do I decide how much work is enough?
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   He elaborates that he works in software engineering
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   and he feels like there is always more work to do,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.440]   some new goal to push forward,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.080]   something to optimize, something to improve.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.680]   Well, Joshua, it's a good question.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.960]   I've been thinking about this recently,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.600]   and actually I want to test out with you in my answer
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   a new idea about this.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.240]   So an experimental system,
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.480]   and we can see if it actually works.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.200]   It'll be a sort of breaking news advice
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.160]   I want to offer you.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.900]   But here's the big picture that sets up this advice.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.600]   Maximizing output is not sustainable.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.520]   It almost always leads to some notion of burnout
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.720]   or some notion of pain.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.340]   If your goal is how can I get more done?
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.600]   Can I add even more onto what I'm doing?
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.880]   You're trying to maximize that amount.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   This is not a road that long-term
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.800]   is going to lead somewhere good.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.240]   In the short term,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.720]   it's not necessarily a counterproductive play.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.740]   In the short term, in certain jobs or certain positions,
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.320]   hustling on lots of different things
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.520]   and trying to maximize that output can be impressive.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.960]   It can open up new opportunities.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.880]   It can accelerate the pace at which let's say a business
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.440]   is able to find its footing or figure out what works well.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.100]   So it's not that it's entirely negative in the short term,
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.760]   but long-term, I think it is negative.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.720]   Two things happen.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.660]   One, long-term you burn out.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.160]   You burn out and then long-term that significantly hurts
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.680]   obviously what you're able to produce.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.760]   If you go strong for two years
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.060]   and then completely burn out
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.420]   and basically leave the industry,
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.040]   your lifetime productivity obviously is much lower.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.680]   Two, I think the quality goes down.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.380]   So the issue with maximizing output
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.980]   is that when you do more and more things,
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.000]   you're context switching more,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.340]   you're burning up through more energy
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.800]   so that the care with which you're able to approach
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.160]   each individual thing goes down.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.320]   I'm a big believer that your best lever,
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.040]   if your interest is impact or interestingness in your life,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.880]   your best lever is doing the thing you do best better.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.720]   It's almost always the right lever.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.680]   Almost always gonna open up more opportunities,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.000]   create more impact
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.260]   and lead to a more interesting professional life.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.580]   If your focus is what do I do best,
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.920]   how do I make that better?
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.860]   Now that's different than the approach
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.680]   that you're talking about that you're tired of,
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.880]   which is the approach of how can I do more?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.560]   It's a quantity over quality mindset.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.280]   Now again, short-term maybe it looks impressive,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.800]   short-term maybe it opens up opportunities,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.360]   but focusing on a small number of things,
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.120]   doing them really well,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.600]   that's gotta be the sustainable play.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.360]   I've long believed that.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.120]   All right, so let's test out as promised a new system
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.160]   and this is preliminary.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.360]   So, take all this with a grain of salt,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.360]   but here's one way to think about limiting your work
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.240]   without let's say crippling your ability
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.600]   to actually do anything of value.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.360]   Let's break up the work on your plate into three categories,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.680]   small, medium, large.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.840]   The extremes here are the interesting ones
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.760]   from the planning perspective.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.840]   Small is administrative work and tasks.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.720]   These are small things,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.040]   most of them don't take very long to do.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   There's a certain baseline of small tasks
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.160]   that are unavoidable.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.240]   You're a software developer,
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.160]   you have to submit your TPS reports
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.200]   or Lumberg is gonna yell at you.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.840]   On the other extreme, you have large work.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.720]   And I think this, as the projects that require
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.160]   more than a week or two to complete,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.360]   this tends to be the category where you find the things
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.180]   that really move the needle.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.600]   It's the producing the next release of the software,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.040]   it's writing the next book, et cetera.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.480]   And then you have medium, which is,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   it's an important in between.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.160]   These are things that aren't tasks in the sense that,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.640]   give me 20 minutes and I'll be done.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.860]   They might take multiple sessions or an afternoon,
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.080]   but they can typically be completed in less than a week.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   Hey, Cal, we need you to process these faculty applications
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.160]   and put your feedback into this spreadsheet
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.440]   before our meeting on Thursday.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.160]   That was my, that's my week this week, for example.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.840]   I have a meeting later today,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.520]   we're discussing faculty applications
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.720]   and I had to read through a bunch of applications
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.400]   and put my notes into a spreadsheet.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.380]   And that's not a large project.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.080]   It's not something that's gonna take weeks and weeks.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.140]   It's not a core, like this really moves the needle
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.020]   on your career, but it's also not a small task.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.160]   I can't say, hold on, I'll be right back.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.880]   I just need to go over there and look at these applications.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.760]   That took about four hours.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.040]   So less than a week, more than 10 minutes.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.320]   All right, now we have categories.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.280]   How do we tame it?
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   First things first, let's get real serious
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.680]   about the small.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.640]   I'm a big believer that if you do not tame
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.320]   the small administrative, it can be a background hum
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.660]   of overload and anxiety that makes almost everything else
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.500]   difficult to do.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.120]   So let's get our handle around the small.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.240]   And I don't wanna go too much into detail here
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.640]   because we could do a whole episode
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.200]   on taming the administrative.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.600]   And this is something that I still need to think about
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.360]   some myself, but you wanna eliminate some things,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.400]   you wanna automate things,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.920]   you wanna have better communication processes for things.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.680]   So it's not just emails arriving randomly.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.320]   For more on that last idea, see my book,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.560]   "A World Without Email."
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.960]   But really the goal here is to get your small
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.760]   administrative task automated/corraled.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.120]   There are set times when I work on these things
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.520]   and do a better systems engineering and do batching
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.920]   and do elimination.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.720]   I am able to just know here's when I work
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.640]   on administrative stuff happens.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.880]   And some of this is just simple, your batching email.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.360]   Some of this is way more complicated.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.800]   I have an office hours on this time.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.600]   And this is when you come to me if you have quick questions
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.480]   and that's when I deal with those quick questions.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.120]   In a recent New Yorker article,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.000]   I even suggested sort of off the top of my head,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.280]   imagine a system and most people can't get away with this.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.800]   I just love this idea.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.560]   Imagine a system in which you have
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.880]   a couple administrative blocks
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.620]   pre-assigned on your calendar,
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.040]   maybe three times a week, one hour each.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   And you have slots.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.680]   I don't know how many, 10 slots on a shared Google Doc
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.920]   for each of these sessions.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.640]   You say, okay, if you need me to do something quick,
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.720]   answer a question, fill out a form, get back to you,
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.360]   that's great, I'm happy to do it, I wanna be useful.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   So you just have to go find
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.520]   one of my upcoming administrative blocks
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.800]   where there's a free slot,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.840]   enter the information from what you need from me,
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.640]   where to find the files, et cetera.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.240]   And when I get to that session,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.900]   I'm gonna go down that list.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.580]   The number of slots I have on this document are such
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.440]   that I should have time to get through everything.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.520]   And that's when that work will get done.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.680]   And oh, if all those slots are filled this week,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.440]   that means I don't have time for this this week,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.760]   you'll have to find a future slot.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.080]   Like imagine a world like that,
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.160]   as opposed to our current world
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.640]   where that person will just shoot you an email
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.720]   and be like, take care of this
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.520]   and give you none of the information.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.840]   The stress of how much email we have
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.640]   really seems to dumb down the detail and sophistication
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.480]   with which we talk.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.220]   I mean, if you were to come to me and talk to me in person,
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.640]   you need something from me, you would get into it.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.880]   You'd be like, yeah, yeah,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.920]   let me tell you about this thing.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.520]   Here's this form, don't worry about these two things.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.720]   And then once you get it signed,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.080]   actually why don't you just put it in my mailbox.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:21.920]   I don't need it till Friday.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.280]   We'd have a very normal conversation.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.680]   In an age of email overload,
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.080]   instead what we get is,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.700]   you have six seconds at the keyboard,
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.560]   you form fill good, think good with a typo.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.740]   And then like a signature under it that says,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.480]   sent from an iPhone, excuse the typos, right?
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.320]   It's just crazy.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.100]   Imagine a world where you had to go find a slot
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.300]   that I had free.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.980]   And if the information was not there that I needed to do it,
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.460]   you would just see a note at like insufficient information
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.380]   and you'd have to find another slot.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.660]   All right, that's extreme because it would annoy people,
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.140]   but man, I think we should annoy people more.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.420]   That'd be great.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.840]   Stepping back, the point here is small work,
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.900]   I want you to have corralled.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.060]   This is when it happens.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.360]   I know how much time it takes and where that time falls.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.180]   All right, step two in my experimental system.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.140]   Look at the time that remains.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.200]   Now how much time remains depends on
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.180]   how much you wanna work.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.860]   If you're in a normal nine to five office job, it's clear,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.900]   you're working backwards from roughly 40 hours,
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.200]   but hey, if you're a small business owner,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.500]   you're a freelancer,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.380]   you can set this number to whatever the hell you want.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.940]   And it could be like, okay, I work 20 hours a week,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.860]   let's see what I can do with that.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.340]   So whatever the hour is, whatever hour amount it is,
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.160]   you work backwards to say how many hours are left.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.900]   The next thing I want you to do is figure out
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.660]   how do I partition these remaining hours each week
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.340]   between medium and large?
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.300]   Is it 50/50?
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.020]   Is it 10/90?
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.340]   Again, this really depends what your job is.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.380]   If you're a novelist, for example,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.140]   that should probably be 10% of the remaining time,
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.500]   medium, 90% large.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.120]   Because mainly what you should be doing
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.420]   is writing your novel.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.940]   And the 10% is like, okay, I have to do,
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.740]   get back some interview questions
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.460]   or fill out this thing for publicity.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.840]   Like there's not that much stuff
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.220]   and 10% of your time should get it done.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.780]   But if you're in a project manager job,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.500]   you might have a very different equation there.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.860]   Where you're like, actually, maybe 80% of my time is medium.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.800]   It's gonna be sort of short-term things
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.840]   that need to be dealt with to keep my team going.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.900]   We have to figure out,
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.060]   get this report together for this client.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.460]   We have to figure out how to deal with a,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.540]   someone's on leave and how we're gonna reassign to work.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.060]   A lot of what you do is medium.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.180]   And then maybe you have 20% of your time for large.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.980]   You're like, I need to be working on one large project
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.420]   at a time because there's some big swing ideas I have
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.660]   and the medium is gonna keep my job.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.260]   But this one large thing I'm working on
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.240]   is what's gonna get me to my next job
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.860]   or let me start my own business.
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.700]   So you figure it out.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.820]   What's my division between medium and large?
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.420]   All right, now you have a number.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.680]   Yeah, I have this many hours a week to work on medium.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.480]   I have this many hours a week to work on large.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.180]   And then you just work backwards and say, okay,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.500]   so how many large things can I sustain
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.700]   with that many hours a week?
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.460]   And there's your answer, Joshua, for that question.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.660]   Then you look at medium things.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.820]   Well, how many with this many hours a week,
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.220]   how many is sort of these medium one week size projects
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.720]   can I handle at a time?
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   There's your answer.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.020]   And then those are the slots you have free for work.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.100]   And as you finish something,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.700]   you pull something else into it.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.780]   Now, what do you do with this other work?
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.800]   Again, this is another whole discussion,
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.560]   but essentially either your company or your team
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.520]   or just you on your own need some sort of external system
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.040]   in which incoming work is filtered.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.080]   Then once it's in there, it's stored.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.740]   And people understand that this is not being worked on.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.200]   It's being stored.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.600]   And you pull work out of that system to fill in these slots.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.100]   And again, that's a whole other discussion.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.180]   Let's not get into that right now.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.040]   But basically what I'm suggesting here, Joshua,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   is that you're very carefully figure out
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.680]   based on how much I wanna be working,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.820]   how much time do I have available?
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.820]   What then does that allow in terms of how much I can do?
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.540]   And that's just a reality check.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.580]   That like actually like this is how much you can do
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.780]   if you wanna stick to roughly that amount of work working.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.900]   And this is after you're being very efficient, right?
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.720]   But the main thing you're doing here that's super productive
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.820]   in the old school sense is that
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.940]   you're taming all these small tasks,
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.220]   you're getting them consolidated,
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.940]   you're automating things, you're improving processes.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.820]   You're being very careful with your time.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.180]   What remains, you're just being very honest.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.400]   How much of this, how much stuff can I actually do?
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.500]   Now, if you don't like that answer,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.140]   there's two things you can do.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.920]   One is you can change your ratios.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.380]   You might say, I gotta be doing more large things.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.660]   Like what am I doing with myself here?
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.020]   I'm doing too many TPS reports.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.300]   So change that ratio.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.280]   Or you might be saying, this is not enough medium stuff.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.900]   I can't keep up with what my job requires
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.120]   if I only have this much time to work on medium projects.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.580]   Then you have to just face the reality and say,
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.220]   I just don't do large projects.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.740]   Or I spend very little time on large projects.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.580]   And that's just reality.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.100]   Two, you can change the hours.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.060]   I'm gonna add more hours to it.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.500]   I'm gonna start work early.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.460]   I'm gonna work Sunday mornings.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.660]   I'm gonna add another hour every day.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.620]   And that extra hour lets me do like one large project.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.460]   Those are your options,
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.380]   but you're facing the productivity dragon,
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.000]   and you're facing the productivity dragon.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.300]   Here's my new twist in a quantitative fashion.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.500]   You don't just see it as this general
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.820]   mess of smoke and fire.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.940]   You're measuring its weight
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.060]   and how far its flames can go and its strength
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.100]   and coming up with like, what can I do with this year?
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.460]   I'm stretching that metaphor.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.220]   All right, but anyways, that's what I'm thinking, Joshua.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.220]   Maximizing, just generically speaking,
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.060]   is gonna burn you out,
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.660]   make you less productive in the long run.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.700]   You should have a number for how many big projects
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.900]   and medium projects you can do at a time.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.060]   Stick to that number
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.200]   and figure out that number systematically.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.260]   All right, let's move on now.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.180]   We have a question from Steven.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:04.440]   By the way, a quick, now that we're doing video,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.980]   I think about these things.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.780]   This isn't a side, but there is a guy on YouTube
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.940]   that some of you have been sending me his videos,
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.140]   and he's very popular, 2 million subscribers.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.420]   And his name is John Campbell.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.100]   And he's, I think, a doctor in the UK,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.260]   and he does COVID update videos.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.340]   Like, here's what's going on, mainly like UK-centric.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.700]   Here's the numbers, here's whatever.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.100]   And they're insanely popular.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.500]   And the two things that make them so popular,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.500]   it's not that there is like some sort of new content
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.660]   or something like that.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.020]   He has a great accent,
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.020]   but two, he has a camera that aims down at his notes,
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.100]   and he literally just cuts to this camera,
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.700]   and you see him underline words
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.900]   or put check marks next to things he just talked about.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.060]   So I just checked off Joshua's question on here.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.880]   You would think, objectively speaking,
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.960]   that that would be the least interesting visual content
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.900]   that you could imagine,
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.560]   especially in this cable news age of graphics and chyrons
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.500]   and sweeping whatever.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.740]   It's incredibly compelling.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.980]   He has 2 million subscribers.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.340]   It is really compelling to watch someone
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.940]   just sort of cross off and underline things
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.780]   they're talking about.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.000]   So my point is, Jesse, when you hear this
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.100]   and you're editing it,
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.020]   I think we gotta get an overhead cam in here
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.740]   so people can watch me check mark off
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.940]   and underline things with the questions.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.260]   If it works for Campbell, it works for us.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.340]   All right, that's an aside.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.460]   Let's get to Stephen's question.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.760]   Stephen, my apologies.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.620]   Stephen asks, "Why don't you show overhead camera shots
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.460]   "of your notes?"
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.700]   See, Stephen knows it.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.140]   Stephen knows what's going on.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.960]   No, I'm joking.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.380]   Stephen really asks, "I've really gone all in
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.720]   "on time blocking, and it definitely works.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.580]   "Now though, it feels like I have even more to do,
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.980]   "and I find myself feeling as though
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.960]   "I am forgetting something,
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.340]   "even though I do a shutdown ritual and weekly plan.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.520]   "Is this normal?
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.940]   "And with time, does this feeling go away?"
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.100]   Stephen, it does go away.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.860]   The thing you need to lean into to make it go away
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.060]   is the shutdown ritual.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.940]   I created the shutdown ritual for exactly this issue.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:14.500]   I was suffering from this as a grad student at MIT.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.660]   I was having a hard time shutting down.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.740]   Like I'm forgetting things,
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.660]   or I need to keep making progress on a problem.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.220]   I've talked about this before on the show,
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.020]   but at the time there was like a key theorem
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.940]   for my PhD dissertation, and it was not working.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.260]   I was like, "Oh man, I gotta keep thinking about it,
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.100]   "'cause if it doesn't work,
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.440]   "the dissertation's not gonna work, it's a problem."
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.460]   And I was like, "I need a way to just kind of shut down,
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.440]   "like shut down, here's what I worked on today,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.760]   "this didn't work, here's why,
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.320]   "here's the next avenue of attack I'm gonna do tomorrow,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.380]   "and write that down as part of my shutdown ritual
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.800]   "so I could just trust it.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.340]   "All right, I don't have to keep thinking about this tonight."
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.740]   And aside about that, by the way,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.880]   just a tip to aspiring doctoral students,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.900]   because I was bored and antsy in general,
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.620]   I was writing books and doing things like this,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.960]   I had a ton of publications,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.940]   what you normally do in theoretical computer science,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.580]   is say, "Yes, it's time to write a dissertation."
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.740]   Of course, I'm gonna draw from these mini publications
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.180]   I've spent a lot of time on,
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.620]   and I'm gonna pull together ideas
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.140]   I have already published and presented and has peer reviewed,
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.960]   and I'm gonna expand upon it,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.780]   and this is what I'm gonna do for my dissertation.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.500]   That is what you should do.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.740]   Instead, I said, "I don't know, I'm kind of bored,
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.840]   "I'm just gonna do something from scratch.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.080]   "I'm gonna come up with a brand new idea,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.820]   "pull it out of the air,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.960]   "and do a whole dissertation in a six month period
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.400]   "on mathematical concepts that I'm just gonna invent.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.060]   "I haven't published, I haven't gone through them,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.780]   "I have no collaborators on them, just because I was bored."
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.060]   It worked out, the thesis was fine,
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.300]   but it was nerve wracking,
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.740]   because exactly what I'm talking about here,
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.740]   I'm halfway through this thing,
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.620]   like, "Wait, maybe my idea doesn't work here,
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.420]   "because I'm doing it from scratch,
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.860]   "as I'm supposed to be writing my dissertation."
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.980]   So it was quite stressful.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.020]   Anyway, so I invented the shutdown ritual.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.180]   It works, it takes some time.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   Let me just briefly review what you have to do
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.060]   to make the shutdown ritual work properly.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.320]   Mechanically, the idea with the shutdown ritual
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.420]   is that you go through
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.600]   and you review every potential open loop.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.580]   All right?
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.840]   Loose notes have been processed.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   There's no critical email that needs an urgent response
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.200]   that I missed.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.040]   I've looked at my weekly plan on my calendar.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.680]   I know what's coming up.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.840]   I know what's coming up tomorrow.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.400]   I see a plan for tomorrow.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.020]   If there's some things I need to do tonight,
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.000]   non-professional things that I need to do tonight
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.280]   that I see in my calendar, my weekly plan,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.360]   I've written them down, so I can see them right there.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.700]   There is no open loop, there's nothing I am forgetting.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.920]   I've taken notes on the conversations,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.740]   I've sent the follow-up emails.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.760]   Now I say a phrase that is unique,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.160]   like schedule shutdown confirm,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.500]   or if you use a time block planner,
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.960]   I'm gonna cross out the shutdown complete checkbox.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.720]   That's the mechanical thing you do.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.140]   You have to couple that with the psychological addendum,
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.080]   and this was what made the shutdown ritual
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.560]   really work for me as a grad student,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.420]   is that after you do that shutdown,
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:09.120]   when your mind then wants to keep thinking about work,
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.800]   which, Steven, I'm telling you,
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.140]   until you get really used to this, it 100% will.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.380]   That's what you're experiencing.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.380]   When your mind says, forget that,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.540]   I wanna think about the email we just sent to Joshua
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.860]   about why doesn't Cal have more overhead shots of his notes
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.620]   and maybe I need to send a different email
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.460]   or word that differently,
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.780]   or I need to talk to my boss tomorrow,
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.880]   let's think that through,
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.800]   your mind's like, we gotta keep thinking about work.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.640]   And you can't blame it.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.940]   You just spent eight hours with work-related circuits
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.260]   firing left and right.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:45.420]   And so, yeah, that's active in your brain.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.400]   That's what's popping up.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.580]   What you do, this is the key psychological addendum
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.940]   to the mechanical shutdown,
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.420]   is you say, I hear it,
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.820]   but I'm not gonna get into the details, mind,
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.740]   of what you want me to get into.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.620]   I'm not gonna get into the details of the email to Steven.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.700]   I'm not gonna get into the details
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.780]   about the meeting with the boss tomorrow.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.120]   Instead, what I'm gonna say is, we did the shutdown.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.300]   I said the phrase, or I checked that box.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.640]   I would not have said that phrase
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.760]   and I would not have checked that box
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.840]   if I had not gone through everything on our plate
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.100]   and closed down all the open loops
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.680]   and made sure that we had a plan I trusted for tomorrow.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.760]   So no, I'm not gonna get into it,
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.720]   psychologically, ruminatively speaking.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.180]   And you do that again and again and again.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.260]   The progress is made every single time
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.000]   that your mind wants you to get into a specifics about work
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.060]   and you say instead, I did the shutdown routine,
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.300]   so we don't need to get into that.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.380]   I did the shutdown routine,
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.620]   so we don't need to get into it.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.740]   I like to use the metaphor
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.900]   when I think about my own crazy mind of grooves that get,
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.060]   you get these grooves that your thoughts want to fall into
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.300]   and you're filling in the grooves,
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.520]   each rejection at a time.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.200]   Each time you say, no, I did the routine, I did the routine.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.340]   You're filling in the groove, filling in the groove
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.020]   until it's shallow enough that your thoughts
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.280]   don't get stuck in it and they move on to something else.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.380]   So how long does this take?
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.140]   I don't know, two to three weeks, maybe.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.740]   Give it a month to be safe.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.140]   But if you're rigorous about this,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.980]   this is the miracle of the shutdown routine.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.760]   The thoughts slow down and you become much better
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.480]   at not thinking completely about work after work.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.340]   And it is a huge positive difference.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.100]   The only other thing I would add is have a capture notebook,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.860]   right, accessible in your house
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.340]   and really have a serious routine
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.680]   of the first thing you do in the morning
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.180]   when you look and make your daily time block plans.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.140]   You look at that notebook
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.660]   and anything you wrote down in that notebook,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.700]   you process and look at.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.340]   You gotta really be very diligent about that.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.180]   If you do that, if a new thing pops to mind
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.900]   during the evening after a shutdown routine,
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.620]   you write in the notebook.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.940]   So you don't have to open up your computer,
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.420]   you don't have to go into your email,
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.740]   you don't have to write a note to yourself
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.380]   and put it by your bathroom mirror so you don't forget it.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.200]   You just write in the notebook.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.040]   And if your mind trusts,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.620]   like that's part of my time block planning
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.020]   is I look at that capture and process it.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.300]   That will prevent that when that happens,
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.020]   when something legitimately new comes to mind,
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.140]   oh man, I forgot to send a message
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.460]   about Cal using overhead camera.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.860]   You can jot that down and your mind's like,
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.260]   okay, I'm okay with it.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.260]   All right, so you do those two things,
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.040]   you're gonna be able to have a lot more presence
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.220]   with your brain after work.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.140]   All right, this is where if we, again,
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.260]   if we had the overhead cam, you would see coming in,
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.660]   whoo, crossed off a name.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.740]   I can see it, it's very compelling to see.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.440]   All right, let's move on here.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.600]   Check out our timestamp.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.240]   It's one of the things we miss about Jesse being here
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.480]   is I have to mind my own time here.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.560]   Okay, let's keep moving here.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.040]   Our question number three is from TooMuchRest.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.560]   He asked, how do I come back to work
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.420]   after taking a lunch break?
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.600]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.180]   It's easy to fall down distractive rabbit holes
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.020]   after lunch breaks.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.880]   I suffer from this too.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.480]   Three things I'd recommend,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.200]   and I would combine all three of these things.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.560]   Number one, ritual, have a post-lunch ritual
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.680]   that you always do to prepare you
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.200]   to get back into work mode.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.760]   A walk works really good here.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.840]   I'm talking like five to 10 minutes,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.800]   but you do a certain walk or whatever
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.520]   so that you are teaching your mind
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.760]   that this means we're shifting out
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.400]   of the much more wandering mindset that we're in
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.120]   when we're at lunch and just thinking about things
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.360]   and reading things and watching things
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.640]   back into a work mindset.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.800]   Two, no email right after lunch, no Slack either.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.160]   That just has to be a hard and fast rule.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.920]   Do not start your first session after lunch
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.080]   going down a context switching rabbit hole.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.440]   Like, let me see what's going on in my inbox
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.000]   or what's going on with Slack
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.080]   because your mind will never,
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.040]   well, get back to work mode,
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.360]   but you're gonna really slow it down.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   And you've just added 45 minutes of wandering
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.200]   if you do that.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.660]   So never, ever, ever start your first moments
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.300]   after a lunch break with email or Slack.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.980]   And then three, and this is critical,
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.300]   before lunch, figure out and set up
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.500]   what you're gonna work on right after lunch.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.300]   And again, it shouldn't be email, it shouldn't be Slack.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.220]   So do email and Slack right before lunch.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.980]   So like, okay, I'm not missing something urgent.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.380]   And then set up, I'm gonna work on this report
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.020]   right after lunch, get it loaded up,
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.820]   get it in Word, get the documents
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.020]   that you need to draw from, get that all loaded up.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.520]   Take a look at it, kind of, all right, I get it.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.360]   I see what's going on.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.180]   I've sort of swapped it in.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.140]   I think I'm ready to go.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.180]   Good, let me go eat lunch.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.380]   When I come back, it's all there, it's all got prepped
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.380]   and you can get right into work.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.680]   Those three things, I think, do those three things
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.220]   and you can tame lunch breaks.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.720]   My lunch break recommendation, by the way,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.380]   is read during your lunch breaks if you can.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.780]   It's great for your brain.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.620]   It's a great time to get some reading in.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.100]   And it has a much more minimal impact
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.740]   on your cognitive energy for the remainder of the day
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.860]   as compared to what most people do,
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.900]   which is they open up the internet and their phones
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.860]   and are basically saying, "Put it in my veins,"
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.820]   and just go frenetic crazy.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.420]   And then they're like, "Okay, time to go work
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.260]   on something deep."
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.080]   Yeah, good luck.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.400]   Crossing off.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.180]   Let's see here.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.180]   Oh, here's another, let's do this question here.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.180]   This one comes from Aaron.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.620]   Aaron says, "Why don't you do Zettelkasten?"
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.260]   So I talked about Zettelkasten last week's episode.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.260]   Got a lot of feedback from listeners from it.
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.180]   Aaron's asking about it.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.620]   So I thought I'd put in another Zettelkasten question here
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.860]   because it seems to be a topic
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.180]   that people are interested in.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.680]   Let me just really briefly give a slightly better description
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.620]   of how this system works.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.740]   So with the kind of pure Zettelkasten system,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.540]   and I'm talking about the how to take smart notes system.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.460]   This is the Nicholas Luhmann system explained in the book,
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.700]   How to Take Smart Notes.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.140]   The way it works is, just to be a little bit more precise,
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:52.780]   is that instead of trying to have a hierarchical note setup
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.460]   where it's, you know, here's the top level
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.580]   and there's folders under there,
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.100]   and then there's subfolders and those subfolders,
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.220]   it's more loose and it allows for more connections.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.820]   And the way it works is you take notes on a slip,
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.180]   piece of paper, an X card or whatever.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.340]   You take all your notes on there.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.300]   And so if you're reading a book,
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.700]   you'll generate a lot of these notes,
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.220]   like for every independent idea in the book
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.620]   you wanna keep track of or think of.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.900]   And then what you do is you go through the box,
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.020]   it's called a slip box in the traditional system.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:26.020]   You go through the box and find an existing note
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.740]   that is relevant to it and you put it behind it.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:33.380]   That physical proximity implies a connection
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.260]   in classic Zettelkasten, in physical analog Zettelkasten.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.260]   So I'm reading this book and I took some notes
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.260]   on Concord, Massachusetts in the early industrial period.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.300]   And so maybe I put it, I have like some notes over here
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.900]   about colonial New England or something.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.020]   And I'm gonna put it back there, like this is connected.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.740]   The physical proximity is a connection.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   The other thing you can do,
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.300]   if there's other notes you wanna connect it to,
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.820]   in analog Zettelkasten, there's a numbering system.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.700]   Every card is uniquely numbered.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.800]   You can actually just jot down on their links,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.780]   just the numbers of other cards that this relates to.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.660]   So maybe you have another thing about industrialization.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.700]   Maybe you have another thing about new social history,
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.780]   case studies or something.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.280]   And like, you just write those numbers.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.260]   So now if you're reading that sequence of notes
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.420]   that this thing falls into,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.620]   you'll come across that information,
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.580]   but it also will link the other things.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.460]   And there's other details here.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.660]   You can also take other notes and add links to those back
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.160]   to this new thing you added.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.560]   So you have notes kind of show up in a physical proximity,
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.260]   like in the Dewey decimal system, but much more ad hoc.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.580]   Near other notes that are similar,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.140]   but then you also have these links between notes.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.040]   This goes to this note, this note goes back to here,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.880]   this goes over here.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.380]   So you begin to get this rich connection
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.540]   of lateral links between notes.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.460]   And a lot of the magic of Zettelkasten is in those links.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.180]   Now, of course, the worry is what if you forget
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.140]   where something is?
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.100]   Well, the other piece you have in Zettelkasten is an index.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.340]   And the idea is you should be able to get to any card
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.660]   starting from the index.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.100]   Not meaning that every card is listed in that index,
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.300]   because that would be too long.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.740]   Upon his death in the late 1990s,
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.260]   the sociologist Nicholas Luhmann,
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.300]   who helped really work out the details
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.260]   of the Zettelkasten system,
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.760]   he had 90,000 index cards in his boxes.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.980]   So no, you don't have a 90,000 item index,
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.640]   but you should be able to get to any card in your system,
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.220]   either by directly seeing it in the index,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:39.220]   or by going from the index to a related topic,
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.500]   and then flipping through all the cards
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.300]   that are next to each other related to that topic,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.380]   finding it in there.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.780]   And this is how you can also figure out where to put it.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.460]   You can look at your index and say,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.460]   oh, it's related to this topic.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.260]   So I'll go look up where that card is
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.620]   and put it behind that stack of cards.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.820]   But I also see these other related topics on the index,
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.780]   so maybe I'll put those links down.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.740]   It's something like that.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.780]   Now, Zettelkasten hardcore people are gonna yell at me
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.180]   because I'm not getting this quite right,
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.280]   but that's the system.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.100]   All right, and then we talked about it last week.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.220]   So I don't wanna dwell on the details of my assessment,
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:17.940]   but basically, one of the claims of Zettelkasten,
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.820]   like I mentioned last week,
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.660]   is that it can essentially automate writing.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.960]   That once you have all these rich lateral connections
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.100]   between ideas, you can just surf these connections
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.620]   and you'll just come across ideas you stitch together,
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.100]   and that will give you an article,
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.980]   that will give you a book.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.900]   As I said last week, I don't buy that.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.900]   I think it's incredibly narrow writing context
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.180]   in which that would work.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.620]   I do not think that matches with my understanding
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.540]   of the writing process as someone
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.340]   who's been a professional writer my entire adult life.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.340]   So I don't buy that.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.860]   But I do wanna emphasize what I do like about Zettelkasten,
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.180]   maybe a little bit more clearly,
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.740]   which is if you're in my line of work,
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.380]   I come across and deal with a lot of ideas,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.000]   and I don't really have a great way
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.940]   of keeping track of them.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.780]   And I've tried to do this hierarchically
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.780]   before in Evernote, but it gets pretty much out of control.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.300]   I like the flexibility and low friction nature
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.340]   of Zettelkasten, this idea that I can,
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.060]   especially using a digital tool,
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.740]   quickly make a note, write through all of my ideas on it,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:21.460]   and link it to a category, link to a few other categories,
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.420]   drop something in an index, and just know it's in there.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.580]   It's not gonna be forgotten.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.220]   And that some interesting connections to it
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.240]   might build up over time that might spark some ideas.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   It's not going to automate writing,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.940]   but things aren't gonna get lost.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.160]   You can find things, you can store things.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.420]   I do like that aspects of it.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.940]   So anyways, I'm working on it.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.660]   I mean, I'm using Rome, as I mentioned.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.100]   I have a lightweight implementation
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.100]   of Zettelkasten going on,
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.920]   and I'm trying to make it more heavyweight.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.620]   I'm also thinking about moving some more academic work
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.900]   into Zettelkasten, so proofs and theorems and citations.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.300]   Some of you have sent me some useful information
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.640]   about how to do that with Rome.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.440]   So I'm Zettelkasten-curious, ZC.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.580]   And not that I think it's gonna automate my writing,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.380]   but I do think it might actually be a better way
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.980]   to store information.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.820]   So there we go.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.720]   This has now become like our weekly Zettelkasten update.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.420]   All right, let's do one more question about Deep Work here.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.320]   This last one comes from Noah.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.940]   Noah says, "How do I limit activities that aren't important
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.740]   "for the long-term at a new job?"
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.280]   So he goes on to explain about how in his past job,
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.940]   he was a chemical testing engineer
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.940]   at a pharmaceutical company.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.740]   They're very a world without email style
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.940]   in their approach to work.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.860]   They had unified task boards to see who was working on what,
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.540]   do you have a free slot for this?
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.060]   They prioritize the primary value producing activity,
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.000]   which for them was actually performing lab tests
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.660]   on chemicals as this is all that matters.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.020]   You gotta make sure you're doing that.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.180]   Everything else is about what you do
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.140]   at the time that remains.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.460]   Pull things off this task board as you have free time.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.020]   Fantastic setup.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.060]   He says now he's a grad student in chemistry
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.120]   and it's not so organized.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.180]   And in particular, he's working on doing,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.140]   he's a teaching assistant.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.140]   It says things just get thrown at him
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.100]   and he feels like he can't ignore them
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.340]   because it's part of his job,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.560]   but it's haphazard and out of control
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.340]   and it's getting in his way of doing the main work.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.840]   So what should he do about it?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.780]   Well, who is this, Noah?
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.140]   Noah, yes, professor types are in general,
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.500]   quite disorganized.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.740]   They will just throw stuff at you
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.180]   because their whole life is chaotic
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.520]   and they just need to get it out of their brain
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.280]   because their brain is exploding
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.880]   with all these different demands they're placing on it
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.660]   and you can't just ignore it.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.600]   But what you can do in most cases as a teaching assistant
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   is take control of the processes.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.740]   Professor doesn't care.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.780]   They just don't wanna have to worry about these things.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.900]   So if you say, here's how I'm working with the students.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.400]   Here's how I think we should work with this.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.700]   Here's the different processes to get the problem sets in,
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.340]   to get them graded, to get notes back, to get whatever.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.460]   Come up with processes that are much more structured,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.700]   much less haphazard and just implement them on your own
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.420]   and talk them through with your professor
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.560]   and say, here's some ideas I have.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.480]   I think we should run it this way.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.740]   It's gonna keep it simpler for you
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.540]   and it's gonna be more controlled.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.860]   Nine out of 10 professors are like, whatever.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.100]   That one sentence you just told me
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.700]   is already taking up more time than I have available.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.060]   Just whatever, whatever we need to do.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:21.900]   They don't care.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.780]   So leverage the fact they're too busy and hairy
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.700]   to now to control the care to shape the job.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.680]   That's my main advice for teaching assistants
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.020]   is that you have more control here than you think
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.720]   about how you want your job to unfold.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   The professors don't care.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.220]   They're happy for you to take the reins
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.620]   and then make this more structured.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.660]   They're not gonna do it
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.140]   because they're terrible at this stuff.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.680]   If they weren't terrible at this stuff,
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.900]   they probably would have left academia
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.740]   and made a lot of money anyway.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.620]   So, okay.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.140]   I'm gonna get yelled at now by professors
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.940]   and Zettelkasten people.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.380]   Great.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.460]   But this is what I would say.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.980]   I remember, I vividly remember having this revelation
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.540]   as a graduate student.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:03.020]   I was TAing, I did a ton of TAing at MIT.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.300]   I TAed a few courses,
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.860]   distributed algorithms with my advisor.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.820]   I also TAed security course with Ron Rivest,
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.060]   who is the R in RSA.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.980]   He invented RSA public key encryption.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.540]   That was interesting.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.100]   And I remember at some point in one of these TAing,
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.500]   I think that when I was TAing first for my advisor,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.300]   just having this insight of like,
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.780]   this is kind of haphazard how we're doing this.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.660]   And there's a lot of structure we could bring to this
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.780]   that would have basically zero impact
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.180]   on the students or the advisor.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.260]   It's not gonna make their life harder.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.100]   They don't care, the professor doesn't care,
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.380]   but it's gonna make my life significantly easier.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.920]   Like, oh, if I do it this way,
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.500]   it's gonna make life much easier.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.860]   Just no one's thinking about it because no one cares
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.300]   because it doesn't directly affect them.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.380]   And I remember I really began to structure,
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.860]   here's our systems for how you hand in problem sets
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.580]   and how we grade them and how we hand things back.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.540]   And it made a big difference.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.940]   I don't remember all the details here,
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.020]   but I vaguely remember that it was just like a casual idea
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.380]   my advisor had, which made sense on paper,
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:11.380]   which was we should Xerox copy the problem set submissions.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:16.140]   So that if we lose one, we have a copy.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.140]   And because I guess it happened like once,
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.220]   like we lost the problem set, like, ah, we can't grade it,
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.540]   but if we have a copy backup, that would help.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.260]   Sounds good on paper.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.500]   It's impossibly time-consuming
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.180]   because these are all coming in in different types of papers.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.380]   They're mainly stapled.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.460]   They're mainly stapled.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.340]   So like, it's impossible to, you have to like,
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.380]   take staples out.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.820]   And it was like hours just Xeroxing these things.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:42.100]   I think at some point, and again,
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.260]   I don't remember the exact details,
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.740]   but I just remember thinking,
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.260]   how often does this happen?
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.940]   Like it happened once four years ago.
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.420]   Let's just, we'll give you all the points if we lose it.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.460]   And we're going to save ourselves all this time.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.860]   Like, and it costs like no time.
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.700]   Like I made that case.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.820]   She was like, fine, that sounds fine.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.780]   But I was just thinking through like, what can we do here?
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.940]   I also remember, and again,
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.300]   I don't have the details here, Noah,
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.260]   so I'm sorry I don't have more specifics,
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.380]   but I also remember realizing at some point
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.180]   the big class and lots of problem sets
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.300]   when we had graders and everything,
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   having the students alphabetize when they hand it in
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.500]   like made a big difference.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.180]   So like, okay, here's the stack.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   When you come up to hand your problem set,
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.620]   find where your name actually is in alphabetical order
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.700]   and put it there.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.740]   10 extra seconds when you submit it,
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.780]   saves a huge amount of time for us on the backend.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.660]   It made it much easier for us to split it up.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.060]   Other things I remember figuring out
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.980]   is like dealing with the undergraduate graders
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.460]   is just automating some of the process.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.300]   These come to me already in alphabetical order.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.820]   I just put them in a mail sorter outside of my office.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.380]   I split them in half in the middle of the names or whatever,
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.620]   and you come and grab them.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.020]   And there's stuff I told the students about format,
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.620]   like make sure that they're in this format,
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.700]   which again had very little impact on the students.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.220]   It was very easier than the change to format.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.580]   Just like, what do you want me to do? Fine.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.700]   But it made like a huge difference
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.020]   in how we could consistently grade it.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.540]   So these types of things made a big difference.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.820]   So know how to do that.
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.380]   Put in place your own processes
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.820]   and people will be fine with it.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.540]   And more generally, even if you're not a teaching assistant,
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:16.540]   there's a teachable moment here, which is add processes.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.740]   Even if the work is coming from someone else,
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.860]   people often don't care.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.700]   They're too busy.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.540]   All right.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.300]   So that's it for questions about deep work.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.140]   We're running a little long here,
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.540]   but let's put in a few questions here
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.540]   as always about the deep life.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.540]   Oh man, look at this one.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.100]   All right, question number one.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.820]   Here's a dangerous one from Duck and Cover,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.900]   appropriate name.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.060]   Duck and Cover asks,
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.460]   how do you stay focused and productive on campus
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.220]   when there is so much attention paid on wokeness?
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:59.220]   Jesse, that's where we put in the dun dun dun,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.100]   like a musical cue.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.060]   Then he or she goes on,
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.620]   I wanna focus on writing papers and teaching,
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.860]   but everyone's so focused on gender and race issues
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.900]   and how do we navigate all this exaggerated wokeness,
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:13.940]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.780]   So I'm gonna punt a little bit on this question,
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.700]   Duck and Cover.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.580]   And focus on just one aspect of it right now.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.900]   I've talked about other aspects of this in other episodes,
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.660]   which is probably one of the best things you can do
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.900]   to stay productive on campus is in a climate
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.300]   of so much wokeness is stopping on the internet so much.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:44.460]   There is obviously a hermeneutic impact of the internet
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:49.460]   in other words, to use,
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:55.780]   let me avoid using purposely obfuscated philosophical terms.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.660]   The internet, what you're experiencing on the internet
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.380]   has a real phenomenological impact
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.300]   on how you actually perceive and understand the world.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.180]   So I use phenomenological to try to avoid
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.980]   using philosophically complex terms.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.980]   Let me try this again.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.860]   What you see online shapes how you understand
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:13.900]   the world around you.
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.580]   So if you are taking in news that is specifically looking
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:24.260]   at finding and isolating and promoting and amplifying
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.940]   sort of outrageous instances of wokeness
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.620]   or political correctness or what have you,
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.340]   pretty soon it will seem like this is what
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.420]   the whole world is like.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.460]   This is all that's going on is the biggest issue.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.740]   I don't even see how we can go on and do research anymore.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.900]   I talk about this somewhat in deep work,
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.620]   not in the context of this particular topic,
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.540]   but I quote the science writer, Winifred Gallagher
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.140]   from her book "Wrapped" about attention in the brain
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.140]   where she says, basically, let me just still
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.860]   a bunch of neuroscience, a bunch of psychology.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.740]   Your world is what you pay attention to.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.420]   And we think about it,
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.300]   oh no, there's like this objective world out there.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.900]   And like, I see some of it, I don't see other,
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.900]   but I'm seeing the objective world,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.060]   but no, the way we experienced the world
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.860]   is very shaped by what we experience online.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.700]   So this is a good case study of that.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.380]   If this is mainly what you're experiencing online,
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.820]   then it's gonna seem like this particular issue
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.700]   is intolerable and pervasive everywhere
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.700]   and it's difficult to go on.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.180]   Compare that to someone like myself
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.780]   who doesn't use social media, who's not online,
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.420]   who doesn't watch cable news.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.300]   And this is not at all my experience,
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.980]   at least at Georgetown University.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:40.100]   I rarely feel like I am faced contentious issues
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.820]   surrounding wokeness in my day-to-day life as a professor.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.100]   I think if I was on Twitter all the time,
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.540]   it would feel like different.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.140]   None of this is to minimize
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.980]   that there's not real debates to be had here.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.820]   There's not real discussions to be had here.
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.300]   There's not real concerns on either side of these issues.
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.500]   Of course there are.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.260]   All I'm saying is you're gonna amplify,
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.900]   you're gonna amplify the role of these issues
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.140]   in your perception of the world
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.540]   if you are bathed in these issues.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.860]   And so that's why I say the number one thing
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.020]   you can do is just stop using Twitter and Facebook.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:18.180]   Stop looking at comments, stop looking at tweets,
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:22.780]   stop looking at campus outrage report.gov.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.260]   I don't know, I don't know websites.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.220]   Just take a break from all that.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.940]   And what should you do instead?
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.740]   Deal with real people.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.100]   Let me talk to real people.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.460]   I'm gonna meet and hang out with my colleagues
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.300]   and real people.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.500]   People have all sorts of different views
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.260]   and it's a college campus.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.820]   So some people will be real extreme over here
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.260]   and some people might be real extreme over there
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.420]   and just have empathy and talk to people and know people
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.300]   and exist in the real world for a while.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.100]   And I think you're gonna feel calmer
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.820]   and things aren't gonna feel so bad.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.460]   I know this is a talking point sometimes
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.220]   of the sort of like elite discourses.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.380]   There's a talking point of like all of this stuff
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.060]   is invented and it's just because of the internet.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.540]   And no, I mean, obviously I think there's real issues here
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.620]   but you're gonna have a much better appreciation
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.140]   of what's really going on
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.860]   and what, if anything, you need to do about it
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.380]   or how you should engage these debates.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.620]   If you come at it separate from the internet,
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:25.060]   you have to break the hermeneutics
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   of the digital addiction stimulating panopticon.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.260]   Trying to use as many trendy philosophical terms
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.620]   as I can right here.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.460]   If you surface the underlying transnational tensions,
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.940]   if you see your online existence
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.980]   as the digitally mediated palimpsest that it is,
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.780]   if you don't know the word palimpsest
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.740]   then you're not in a modern humanities discipline,
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.660]   you haven't read a humanities paper in the last 10 years.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.020]   If you do all of that, I think you just have,
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.980]   it's just like a calmer, more interesting, more engaged,
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.060]   more fluid, more nuanced understanding of the world.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.460]   I gotta tell you, it's just a lot less stressful
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.100]   to not be filtering your world through the internet.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.580]   So there you go, duck and cover.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:13.340]   I ducked a little bit, I covered myself a little bit.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:18.340]   I jumped over to an argument about internet in general,
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.060]   but that's where I land.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.660]   Take a month away from all of that and then reassess.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.020]   All right, another deep life question here.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.180]   This one is from Penelope.
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.420]   Penelope asks, "What's it like to be a published author
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.820]   "and how do you keep sane amid all the competition
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.320]   "and obsession with book sales and contracts?"
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.840]   Penelope, you can't pay much attention to it.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:50.900]   Writing is weird, especially if you're doing
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.580]   big scale professional nonfiction writing like I do.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.660]   It's weird and stochastic.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.940]   Some books blow up, some don't, it's complicated.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.740]   No one can understand necessarily why.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.820]   It's like a confusing world.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.620]   Sometimes you come across a book, you're like,
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:10.940]   I get it, it's a really interesting story
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.020]   or it's really original or it's Danny Kahneman
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:18.300]   is writing "Thinking Fast or Slow" and it's his life's work
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.980]   and he's finally putting it into a book.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.340]   I kinda get that.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.440]   And then sometimes it's random.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.460]   It's like, I don't know.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.020]   Why does James Clear's book on habits,
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.880]   5X outsell Charles Duhigg's book on habits?
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.180]   I don't know.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.220]   Why is Mark Manson's first book,
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.580]   "The Subtle Art of Not Giving Enough Word,"
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.780]   why did that sell 12 million copies?
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.740]   It's a great book, but there's a lot of great books
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.820]   that don't, he doesn't know, I've asked him.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.980]   It's like, I don't know.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.460]   So you can't worry about it.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.380]   So how do you not worry about it?
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.160]   Well, I'll tell you what I do is I never signed up
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.420]   for the author portals.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:02.620]   I don't know how to look up sales numbers on my books.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.380]   My agent will mention things to me.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.020]   My editors will sometimes mention things to me.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.380]   I'm like, that sounds great.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.160]   But I mainly find out how well my books
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.620]   are doing twice a year when I get my royalty statements.
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.660]   I'm like, ah, that's great.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.660]   And I think that has done really well.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.220]   Contracts, don't worry about book contracts.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.620]   That's such a small percentage of your time
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.460]   where that's relevant.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.460]   Like, oh, I'm working on a book contract now, great.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.700]   And then there'll be two years again
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.460]   until you're working on another book contract again.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.700]   You're just sort of writing at that point.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.340]   So I don't worry about that.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.540]   But Penelope, that's my advice.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.780]   It's not that you're gonna be able to do this perfectly,
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.980]   but you just can't compare.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.900]   It's like a weird stochastic world.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.500]   Why one book does well over here
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.440]   tells you nothing about how your book should do over here.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.180]   Maybe this book should do really well and it doesn't,
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.220]   or it's going really slow
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.860]   and then it does really well later.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.980]   What I always do is just focus on the next book.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.480]   So like when I have a book out,
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.580]   I don't look up at sales numbers 'cause I don't know how.
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.840]   And I always just get to the mindset of like,
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.220]   well, forget that book.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.580]   This new one, this is the one that's gonna be a home run.
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.820]   I was rushed for that one,
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.000]   but this one's gonna be the home run.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.020]   I just get my attention towards
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.580]   what's happening in the future.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.780]   Interesting story.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.700]   I mean, I've talked about this before.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.700]   I've had a lot of books that seem slow
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.980]   and then sold a lot later.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.460]   So, "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.300]   That came out in 2012.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:20.660]   That was my first major hardcover release.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.740]   I'd written those three student books.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.980]   It was my first sort of major hardcover idea book,
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.660]   got a reasonable advance for it.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.380]   A lot of energy behind it.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:32.280]   And nothing really happened much when it came out.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.700]   And so I think it was considered,
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.700]   I'm assuming it was considered a failure
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:40.700]   because a couple of years later when I sold "Deep Work,"
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.240]   they knocked $50,000 off the advance
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.140]   that I got for "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.100]   Like, yeah, I don't think this book worked, right?
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.660]   It's 2012.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.500]   Fast forward to today,
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.340]   that book has sold 300 plus thousand copies.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.840]   Like it's a very successful book,
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:54.820]   but you never would have known it.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.460]   "Deep Work" has sold a million copies,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.300]   but I was worried when "Deep Work" first came out,
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.340]   I was like on the phone frustrated with my agent.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.900]   Like my friends can't even find this in Barnes & Noble.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.020]   Like no one cares about this book.
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.220]   So, you know, sometimes it's random.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.540]   You think something's not gonna do well
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.220]   and then it does really well later.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.500]   Or you think something's gonna do really well
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.480]   and it never does.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.380]   So write the next one.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:19.300]   Don't look at sales numbers, write the next one.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.780]   All right, we've got a question here from Taylor.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:25.180]   Taylor says, "How do you count time
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.640]   that is in between "Deep Work" and "Deep Leisure?"
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.540]   Well, before I even get your elaboration,
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.860]   my quick answer is like, why are you counting time?
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.700]   Does it matter?
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.420]   Let's look at the elaboration,
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.740]   see if we get some more clarity here.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.340]   "I have a practice of deeply reading
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.700]   and taking careful notes on books
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.660]   that have no immediate relevance to my scholarly research."
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.900]   He's a tenured professor.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.020]   "Because I file my notes into a Zettelkasten system."
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:50.840]   Oh man, here we go.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.980]   Zettelkasten corner, take two.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.300]   "There is always a chance that my irrelevant notes
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.740]   may one day prove useful for my day job.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.540]   Should I count this note-taking time as "Deep Work"
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.540]   or do you consider it "Deep Leisure?"
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.500]   "Wondering for the purpose of budgeting my time
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.140]   and meeting "Deep Work" quotas."
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.180]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.940]   Taylor, I'd say don't care so much about that.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.980]   I don't think you have to like precisely account
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.820]   for this time.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:17.460]   You know, is this exactly work or is this exactly leisure?
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.980]   What does matter?
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.260]   That you are making regular progress
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.980]   on the things that really matter and obsessing over quality.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.500]   We talked about this earlier in the show,
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.900]   like how you have a certain,
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.200]   a reasonable number of projects
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.980]   you're dealing with concurrently.
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:34.280]   You're giving those like good attention,
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.260]   working on each thing till a natural stopping point
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.380]   before switching on to the next.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.220]   You feel like you're really exercising
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.500]   your intellectual muscles.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.260]   You see the progress being made.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.540]   You have the right amount of your time
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.980]   focused on the stuff that really matters.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.920]   Do that and don't worry so much about like,
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.500]   should that 30 minutes of messing with my
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.540]   Zettelkasten slip box,
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.920]   does that count in some ledger book
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.540]   as deep work or deep leisure?
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:54.660]   Don't worry about that.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.500]   When you work, when you work,
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.380]   when you're done, when you're done,
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.940]   where it overlaps, it overlaps.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:03.820]   All right, so let's, I'm looking at the time here.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:04.660]   Yeah, we're at an hour.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.580]   So I think it's a good place to wrap it up.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.380]   Thank you everyone for sending in these questions.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:14.380]   And remember, videos are now available.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.860]   Link in the show notes.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.200]   I'll post a link on my blog
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.360]   and pretty soon we'll have a personalized URL you can use,
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.780]   but go check out those videos.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.980]   We'll be putting up the videos
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.000]   of the questions you heard today.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.440]   We'll trickle those out throughout the next week or two.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.560]   And until next time, stay deep.
