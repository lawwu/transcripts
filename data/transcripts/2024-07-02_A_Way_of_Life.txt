[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180]   "What each day needs, that shalt thou ask; each day will set its proper task."
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.560]   - Goethe Fellow students, every man has a philosophy
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:23.100]   of life in thought, in word, or in deed worked out in himself unconsciously.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.860]   In possession of the very best, he may not know of its existence; with the very worst,
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.980]   he may pride himself as a paragon.
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.180]   As it grows with the growth, it cannot be taught to the young in formal lectures.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.260]   What have bright eyes, red blood, quick breath, and taut muscles to do with philosophy?
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.340]   Did not the great staggerites say that young men were unfit students of it?
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.580]   They will hear as though they heard not, and to no profit.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.260]   Why then should I trouble you?
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.620]   Because I have a message that may be helpful.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.920]   It is not philosophical, nor is it strictly moral or religious, one or other of which
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.580]   I was told my address should be, and yet, in a way, it is all three.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.300]   It is the oldest and the freshest, the simplest and the most useful.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.340]   So simple indeed is it that some of you may turn away disappointed, as was Naaman the
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.260]   Syrian when told to go wash in Jordan and be clean.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.500]   You know those "composite tools" to be bought for fifty cents with one handle to
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.100]   fit a score or more of instruments?
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.540]   The workmanship is usually bad, so bad as a rule that you will not find an example in
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.100]   any good carpenter's shop, but the boy has one.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.980]   The chauffeur slips one into his box, and the sailor into his kit, and there is one
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.260]   in the odds-and-ends drawer of the pantry of every well-regulated family.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.140]   It is simply a handy thing about the house to help over the many little difficulties
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.660]   of the day.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.340]   Of this sort of philosophy I wish to make you a present, a handle to fit your life tools.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.700]   Whether the workmanship is Sheffield or shoddy, this heave will fit anything from a hatchet
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180]   to a corkscrew.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.140]   My message is but a word, a way, an easy expression of the experience of a plain man whose life
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.420]   has never been worried by any philosophy higher than that of the shepherd in As You Like It.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.700]   I wish to point out a path in which the wayfaring man, though a fool, cannot err, not a system
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.940]   to be worked out painfully only to be discarded, not a formal scheme, simply a habit as easy
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.180]   or as hard to adopt as any other habit, good or bad.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.740]   A few years ago a Christmas card went the rounds with the legend, "Life is just one
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.300]   denied thing after another," which in more refined language is the same as saying, "Life
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.700]   is a habit, a succession of actions that become more or less automatic."
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.580]   This great truth, which lies at the basis of all actions, muscular or psychic, is the
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.060]   keystone of the teaching of Aristotle, to whom the formation of habits was the basis
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.620]   of moral excellence.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.380]   In a word, habits of any kind are the result of actions of the same kind.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.900]   And so what we have to do is to give a certain character to these particular actions.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.740]   From Ethics.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.820]   Lift a seven-months-old baby to his feet, see him tumble on his nose.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.360]   Do the same at twelve months, he walks.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.260]   At two years, he runs.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.840]   The muscles and the nervous system have acquired the habit.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.500]   One trial after another, one failure after another has given him power.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   Put your finger in a baby's mouth and he sucks away in blissful anticipation of a response
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.020]   to a mammalian habit millions of years old.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.820]   And we can deliberately train parts of our body to perform complicated actions with unerring
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.380]   accuracy.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.980]   Watch that musician playing a difficult piece.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.220]   Batteries, commutators, multipliers, switches, wires, innumerable control those nimble fingers,
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.220]   the machinery of which may be set in motion as automatically as in a pianola.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.020]   The player all the time chatting as if he had nothing to do in controlling the apparatus.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.180]   Habit again.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.420]   The gradual acquisition of power by long practice and at the expense of many mistakes.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.580]   The same great law reaches through mental and moral states.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:49.020]   Character, which partakes of both in Plutarch's words, is "long-standing habits."
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.500]   Now the way of life that I preach is a habit to be acquired gradually by long and steady
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.120]   repetition.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.260]   It is the practice of living for the day only and for the day's work.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.860]   Life in day-tight compartments.
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.900]   "Ah," I hear you say, "that is an easy matter, simple as Elisha's advice.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.600]   Not as I shall urge it in words which fail to express the depth of my feelings as to
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.220]   its value."
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.580]   I started life in the best of all environments, in a parsonage, one of nine children.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.640]   A man who has filled chairs in four universities, has written a successful book, and has been
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.940]   asked to lecture at Yale, is supposed, popularly, to have brains of a special quality.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.980]   A few of my intimate friends really know the truth about me, as I know it.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.340]   Mine in good faith, I say it, are of the most mediocre character.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.900]   But what about those professorships, etc.?
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.980]   Just habit, a way of life, an outcome of the day's work, the vital importance of which
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.620]   I wish to impress upon you with all the force at my command.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.580]   Dr. Johnson remarked upon the trifling circumstances by which men's lives are influenced.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.060]   Not by an ascendant planet, a predominating humor, but by the first book which they read,
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.400]   some early conversation which they have heard, or some accident which excited ardor and enthusiasm.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.940]   This was my case in two particulars.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.740]   I was diverted to the Trinity College School, then, at Weston, Ontario, by a paragraph in
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.860]   the circular stating that the senior boys would go into the drawing room in the evenings
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.820]   and learn to sing and dance, vocal and pedal accomplishments for which I was never designed.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.420]   But like Saul seeking his asses, I found something more valuable, a man of the white of Selburne
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.300]   type, who knew nature, and who knew how to get boys interested in it.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.060]   The other happened in the summer of 1871 when I was attending the Montreal General Hospital.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.940]   Much worried as to the future, partly about the final examination, partly as to what I
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.820]   should do afterwards, I picked up a volume of Carlyle, and on the page I opened there
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:11.700]   was the familiar sentence, "Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance,
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.900]   but to do what lies clearly at hand."
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.100]   A commonplace sentiment enough.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.420]   But it hit and stuck and helped, and was the starting point of a habit that has enabled
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:31.140]   me to utilize to the full the single talent entrusted to me.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.460]   The workers in Christ's vineyard were hired by the day.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.980]   Only for this day are we to ask for our daily bread, and we are expressly bidden to take
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.360]   no thought for the morrow.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.140]   To the modern world, these commands have an Oriental savor, counsels of perfection akin
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:55.620]   to certain of the Beatitudes, stimuli to aspiration, not to action.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:01.340]   I am prepared, on the contrary, to urge the literal acceptance of the advice, not in the
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.740]   mood of Ecclesiastes, "Go to now, ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.820]   a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell and get gain, whereas ye know not
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.700]   what shall be on the morrow."
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:22.260]   Not in the Epicurean spirit of Omar with his "jug of wine and thou," but in the modernist
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:29.100]   spirit as a way of life, a habit, a strong enchantment at once against the mysticism
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.220]   of the East and the pessimism that too easily besets us.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.820]   Change that hard saying, "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof" into "the goodness
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.460]   thereof," since the chief worries of life arise from the foolish habit of looking before
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.320]   and after.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.700]   As a patient with double vision from some transient unequal action of the muscles of
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.660]   the eye finds magical relief from well-adjusted glasses, so returning to the clear binocular
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.620]   vision of today, the over-anxious student finds peace when he looks neither backward
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.100]   to the past nor forward to the future.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.260]   I stood on the bridge of one of the great liners, plowing the ocean at 25 knots.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:18.540]   "She is alive," said my companion, "in every plate, a huge monster with brain and nerves,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:25.140]   an immense stomach, a wonderful heart and lungs, and a splendid system of locomotion."
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.700]   Just at that moment, a signal sounded, and all over the ship the watertight compartments
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   were closed.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.020]   "Our chief, factor of safety," said the captain.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.820]   "In spite of the Titanic?"
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.820]   I said.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.860]   "Yes," he replied, "in spite of the Titanic.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:47.940]   Now each one of you is a much more marvelous organization than the great liner, and bound
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.140]   on a longer voyage.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:56.620]   What I urge is that you so learn to control the machinery as to live with day-tight compartments,
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.020]   as the most certain way to ensure safety on the voyage.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.500]   Stand on the bridge and see that at least the great bulkheads are in working order.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:12.340]   Touch a button and hear at every level of your life the iron doors shutting out the
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.220]   past, the dead yesterdays.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:23.460]   Touch another and shut off with a metal curtain the future, the unborn tomorrows.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.180]   Then you are safe, safe for today.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.540]   Read the old story in "The Chambered Nautilus," so beautifully sung by Oliver Wendell Holmes.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:39.660]   Only change one line to, "Day after day beheld the silent toil.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.300]   Shut off the past.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.700]   Let the dead past bury its dead."
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.980]   So easy to say, so hard to realize.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.980]   The truth is the past haunts us like a shadow.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.980]   To disregard it is not easy.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.300]   Those blue eyes of your grandmother, that weak chin of your grandfather have mental
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.900]   and moral counterparts in your makeup.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:11.340]   Generations of ancestors brooding over providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate, fixed fate,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:19.160]   free will, foreknowledge, absolute, may have bred a New England conscience, morbidly sensitive,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.780]   to heal which some of you had rather sing the 51st Psalm than follow Christ into the
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.080]   slums.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.140]   Shut out the yesterdays, which have lighted fools the way to dusty death, and have no
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.380]   concern for you personally, that is, consciously.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.920]   They are there all right, working daily in us, but so are our livers and our stomachs.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.000]   And the past, in its unconscious action on our lives, should bother us as little as they
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.040]   do.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:53.840]   The petty annoyances, the real and fancied slights, the trivial mistakes, the disappointments,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:00.600]   the sins, the sorrows, even the joys, bury them deep in the oblivion of each night.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:08.040]   Ah, but it is just then that to so many of us the ghosts of the past, night riding incubi,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:14.680]   troubling the fantasy, come in troops and pry open the eyelids, each one presenting
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.560]   a sin, a sorrow, a regret.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.280]   Bad enough in the old and seasoned, in the young these demons of past sins may be a terrible
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.600]   affliction.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.280]   And in bitterness of heart many a one cries with Eugene Arum, "Oh God, could I so close
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.600]   my mind and clasp it with a clasp?"
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.840]   As a vaccine against all morbid poisons left in the system by the infections of yesterday,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.800]   I offer a way of life.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.200]   Undress, as George Herbert says, your soul at night.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:56.880]   Not by self-examination, but by shedding, as you do your garments, the daily sins, whether
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.060]   of omission or of commission, and you awake a free man with a new life.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.360]   To look back, except on rare occasions for stocktaking, is to risk the fate of Lot's
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   wife.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.160]   Many a man is handicapped in his course by a cursed combination of retro and introspection,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:23.120]   the mistakes of yesterday paralyzing the efforts of today, the worries of the past hugged to
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:30.960]   his destruction, and the worm regret allowed to canker the very heart of his life.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   To die daily after the manner of St. Paul ensures the resurrection of a new man who
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.840]   makes each day the epitome of a life.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:51.320]   The load of tomorrow added to that of yesterday carried today makes the strongest falter.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:57.520]   Shut off the future as tightly as the past, no dreams, no visions, no delicious fantasies,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.240]   no castles in the air with which, as the old song so truly says, hearts are broken, heads
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.080]   are turned.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.320]   The youth, we are told, belongs the future, but the wretched tomorrow that so plagues
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.460]   some of us has no certainty except through today.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.240]   Who can tell what a day may bring forth?
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.560]   Though its uncertainty is a proverb, a man may carry it secret in the hollow of his hand,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.240]   make a pilgrimage to Hades with Ulysses, draw the magic circle, perform the rites, and then
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.040]   ask Tiresias the question, "I have had the answer from his own lips."
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.560]   The future is today.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.440]   There is no tomorrow.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.400]   The day of a man's salvation is now.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.440]   The life of the present of today, lived earnestly, intently, without a forward-looking thought,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.520]   is the only insurance for the future.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.920]   Let the limit of your horizon be a 24-hour circle.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.960]   On the title page of one of the great books of science, the Discours de la méthode of
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.840]   Descartes, 1637, is a vignette showing a man digging in a garden with his face towards
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.320]   the earth, on which rays of light are streaming from the heavens.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.560]   Beneath is the legend, "Fac'espera," 'tis a good attitude and a good motto.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.640]   Look heavenward if you wish, but never to the horizon.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.960]   That way danger lies.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.880]   Truth is not there.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.480]   Happiness is not there.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320]   Certainty is not there.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.680]   But the falsehoods, the frauds, the quackeries, the "ignes fatui," which have deceived
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.560]   each generation, all beckon from the horizon and lure the men not content to look for the
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.280]   truth and happiness that tumble out at their feet.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.320]   Once while at college, climb a mountaintop and get a general outlook of the land and
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.540]   make it the occasion, perhaps, of that careful examination of yourself, that inquisition
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:06.720]   which Descartes urges every man to hold once in a lifetime, not oftener.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:13.080]   Waste of energy, mental distress, nervous worries dog the steps of a man who is anxious
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.840]   about the future.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:21.880]   Shut close, then, the great fore and aft bulkheads, and prepare to cultivate the habit of a life
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   of day-tight compartments.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.080]   Do not be discouraged.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.480]   Like every other habit, the acquisition takes time, and the way is one you must find for
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   yourselves.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.040]   I can only give general directions and encouragement, and the hope that, while the green years are
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.760]   on your heads, you may have the courage to persist.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.920]   Now, for the day itself, what first?
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.240]   Be your own daysman, and sigh not with Job for any mysterious intermediary, but prepare
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.520]   to lay your own firm hand upon the helm.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.640]   Get into touch with the finite, and grasp in full enjoyment that sense of capacity in
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.440]   a machine working smoothly.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.000]   Join the whole creation of animate things in a deep, heartfelt joy that you are alive,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.200]   that you see the sun, that you are in this glorious earth which nature has made so beautiful
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.920]   and which is yours to conquer and to enjoy.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.580]   Recognize in the words of Browning that there's a world of capability for joy spread round
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.440]   about us, meant for us, inviting us.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.800]   What are the morning sensations?
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.760]   For they control the day.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.800]   Some of us are congenitally unhappy during the early hours, but the young man who feels
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:46.600]   on awakening that life is a burden or a bore has been neglecting his machine, driving it
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:53.240]   too hard, stoking the engines too much, or not cleaning out the ashes and clinkers.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.880]   Or he has been too much with the lady nicotine, or fooling with Bacchus, or worst of all with
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.840]   the younger Aphrodite, all messengers of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.160]   To have a sweet outlook on life, you must have a clean body.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.720]   As I look on the clear-cut, alert, earnest features and the lithe, active forms of our
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.160]   college men, I sometimes wonder whether or not Socrates and Plato would find the race
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.880]   improved.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.720]   I am sure they would love to look on such a gathering as this.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:33.640]   Make their ideal yours, the fair mind in the fair body.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.280]   The one cannot be sweet and clean without the other, and you must realize, with Rabbi
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.900]   Ben Ezra, the great truth that flesh and soul are mutually helpful.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.960]   The morning outlook, which really makes the day, is largely a question of a clean machine,
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.700]   of physical morality in the wide sense of the term.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.160]   C'est l'estomac qui fait les heureux, as Voltaire says.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.120]   No dyspeptic can have a sane outlook on life, and a man whose bodily functions are impaired
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.960]   has a lowered moral resistance.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.160]   To keep the body fit is a help in keeping the mind pure, and the sensations of the first
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   few hours of the day are the best test of its normal state.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.760]   The clean tongue, the clear head, and the bright eye are birthrights of each day.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.120]   Just as the late Professor Marsh would diagnose an unknown animal from a single bone, so can
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.520]   the day be predicted from the first waking hour.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.880]   The start is everything, as you well know, and to make a good start you must feel fit,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.760]   and the young sensations of morning slackness come most often from lack of control of the
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.960]   two primal instincts, biologic habits, the one concerned with the preservation of the
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.480]   individual, the other with the continuance of the species.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.440]   Yale students should by this time be models of dietetic propriety, but youth does not
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.080]   always wreck the reed of the teacher, and I dare say that here, as elsewhere, careless
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.640]   habits of eating are responsible for much mental disability.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.320]   My own rule of life has been to cut out unsparingly any article of diet that had the bad taste
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:17.480]   to disagree with me, or to indicate in any way that it had abused the temporary hospitality
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.160]   of the lodging which I had provided.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.560]   To drink, nowadays, but few students become addicted, but in every large body of man a
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:31.040]   few are to be found whose incapacity for the day results from the morning clogging of nocturnally
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.480]   flushed tissues.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.880]   As moderation is very hard to reach, and as it has been abundantly shown that the best
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.600]   of mental and physical work may be done without alcohol in any form, the safest rule for the
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.120]   young man is that which I am sure most of you follow, abstinence.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.720]   A bitter enemy to the bright eye and the clear brain of the early morning is tobacco, when
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.600]   smoked to excess, as it is now by a large majority of students.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.800]   Watch it, test it, and if need be, control it.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:09.360]   That befogged, woolly sensation reaching from the forehead to the occiput, that haziness
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:16.240]   of memory, that cold, fish-like eye, that furred tongue and last week's taste in the
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.040]   mouth—too many of you know them, I know them—they often come from too much tobacco.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.200]   The other primal instinct is the heavy burden of the flesh, which nature puts on all of
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.480]   us to ensure a continuation of the species.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   To drive Plato's team taxes the energies of the best of us.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.640]   One of the horses is a raging, untamed devil, who can only be brought into subjection by
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.280]   hard fighting and severe training.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.200]   This much you all know as men.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.080]   Once the bit is between his teeth, the black steed passion will take the white horse reason
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.880]   with you, and the chariot rattling over the rocks to perdition.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.760]   With a fresh, sweet body, you can start a rite without those feelings of inertia that
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:03.960]   so often, as Goethe says, make the morning's lazy leisure usher in a useless day.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.880]   Control of the mind as a working machine, the adaptation in it of habit so that its
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:15.080]   action becomes almost as automatic as walking, is the end of education, and yet how rarely
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.280]   reached.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:22.640]   It can be accomplished with deliberation and repose, never with hurry and worry.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.920]   Realize how much time there is, how long the day is.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.040]   Realize that you have sixteen waking hours, three or four of which, at least, should be
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.400]   devoted to making a silent conquest of your mental machinery.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.280]   Concentration, which has grown gradually the power to wrestle successfully with any subject,
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.160]   is the secret of successful study.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.720]   No mind, however dull, can escape the brightness that comes from steady application.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.040]   There is an old saying, "Youth enjoyeth not for haste," but worse than this, the
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.480]   failure to cultivate the power of peaceful concentration is the greatest single cause
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.760]   of mental breakdown.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.940]   Plato pities the young man who started at such a pace that he never reached the goal.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.880]   One of the saddest of life's tragedies is the wreckage of the career of the young collegian
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.640]   by hurry, hustle, bustle, and tension.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.320]   The human machine driven day and night as no sensible fellow would use his motor.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.520]   Listen to the words of a master in Israel, William James, "Neither the nature nor the
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.000]   amount of our work is accountable for the frequency and severity of our breakdowns,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.680]   but their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings of hurry and having no time, in that
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:42.420]   breathlessness and tension, that anxiety of feature and that solicitude of results, that
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:48.660]   lack of inner harmony and ease, in short, by which the work with us is apt to be accompanied,
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.800]   and from which a European who would do the same work would, nine out of ten times, be
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   free."
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.760]   Es bildet ein Talent, sichende Stille, but it need not be for all day.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.920]   A few hours out of the sixteen will suffice.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.040]   Only let them be hours of daily dedication, in routine, in order, and in system.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.640]   And day by day you will gain in power over the mental mechanism, just as the child does
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.680]   over the spinal marrow in walking, or the musician over the nerve centers.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.100]   Aristotle somewhere says that the student who wins out in the fight must be slow in
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:30.000]   his movements, with voice deep and slow speech, and he will not be worried over trifles which
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.320]   make people speak in shrill tones and use rapid movements.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.880]   Shut close in our tight compartments, with the mind directed intensely upon the subject
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.040]   in hand, you will acquire the capacity to do more and more.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:54.000]   You will get into training, and once the mental habit is established, you are safe for life.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.120]   Concentration is an art of slow acquisition, but, little by little, the mind is accustomed
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:07.280]   to habits of slow eating and careful digestion, by which alone you escape the mental dyspepsi
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.460]   so graphically described by Lowell in The Fable for Critics.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.980]   Do not worry your brains about that bugbear efficiency, which, sought consciously and
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.500]   with effort, is just one of those elusive qualities very apt to be missed.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.120]   The man's college output is never to be gauged at sight.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.840]   All the world's coarse thumb and finger may fail to plumb his most effective work.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.440]   The casting of the mental machinery of self-education, the true preparation for a field larger than
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.760]   the college campus.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:45.080]   Four or five hours daily, it is not much to ask, but one day must tell another, one week
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.980]   certify another, one month bear witness to another of the same story, and you will acquire
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.860]   a habit by which the one talent man will earn a high interest, and by which the ten-talent
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.560]   man may at least save his capital.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.780]   Steady work of this sort gives a man a sane outlook on the world.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.100]   No corrective so valuable to the weariness, the fever, and the fret that are so apt to
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.300]   ring the heart of the young.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:16.860]   This is the tallies man, as George Herbert says, the famous stone that turneth all to
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:23.220]   gold, and with which, to the eternally recurring question, what is life?
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.260]   You answer, I do not think, I act it, the only philosophy that brings you in contact
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.440]   with its real values and enables you to grasp its hidden meaning.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:39.900]   Over the slew of despond, past doubting castle, and giant despair, with this tallies man you
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:48.020]   may reach the delectable mountains and those shepherds of the mind, knowledge, experience,
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.300]   watchful and sincere.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:57.000]   Some of you may think this to be a miserable Epicurean doctrine, no better than that so
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.240]   sweetly sung by Horace, "Happy the man, and happy he alone, he who can call today
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:12.540]   his own, he who secure within can say, Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today."
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.700]   I do not care what you think, I am simply giving you a philosophy of life that I have
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.260]   found helpful in my work, useful in my play.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.620]   Walt Whitman, whose physician I was for some years, never spoke to me much of his poems,
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:32.060]   though occasionally he would make a quotation, but I remember late one summer afternoon as
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.460]   we sat in the window of his little house in Camden, there passed a group of workmen whom
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:43.340]   he greeted in his usual friendly way, and then he said, "Ah, the glory of the day's
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:51.220]   work, whether with hand or brain, I have tried to exalt the present and the real, to teach
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:56.220]   the average man the glory of his daily work or trade."
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.940]   In this way of life, each one of you may learn to drive the straight furrow, and so come
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.500]   to the true measure of a man.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.940]   With body and mind in training, what remains?
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.460]   Do you remember that most touching of all incidents in Christ's ministry, when the
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:22.120]   anxious ruler Nicodemus came by night, worried lest the things that pertained to his everlasting
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.860]   peace were not a part of his busy and successful life?
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:33.620]   Christ's message to him is his message to the world, never more needed than at present.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.840]   Ye must be born of the Spirit.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.940]   You wish to be with the leaders.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.200]   As Yale men, it is your birthright.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.200]   Know the great souls that make up the moral radium of the world.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:52.220]   You must be born of their Spirit, initiated into their fraternity, whether of the spiritually
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:58.100]   minded followers of the Nazarene, or of that larger company, elect from every nation, seen
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.420]   by St. John.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.360]   Begin the day with Christ and his prayer.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.900]   You need no other.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.420]   Creedless, with it you have religion.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.180]   Creed stuffed, it will leaven any theological dough in which you stick.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.660]   As the soul is dyed by the thoughts, let no day pass without contact with the best literature
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.380]   of the world.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.840]   Learn to know your Bible, though not perhaps as your fathers did.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:31.200]   In forming character and in shaping conduct, its touch has still its ancient power.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.860]   Of the kindred of Ram and sons of Elihu, you should know its beauties and its strength.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.740]   Fifteen or twenty minutes day by day will give you fellowship with the great minds of
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:46.020]   the race, and little by little as the years pass, you extend your friendship with the
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.980]   immortal dead.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.780]   They will give you faith in your own day.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.840]   Listen, while they speak to you of the fathers.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:00.980]   But each age has its own spirit and ideas, just as it has its own manners and pleasures.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.420]   You are right to believe that yours is the best university at its best period.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.360]   Why should you look back to be shocked at the frowziness and dullness of the students
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.060]   of the seventies or even of the nineties, and cast no thought forward lest you reach
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.180]   a period when you and yours will present to your successors the same doubtiness of clothes
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.180]   and times?
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:29.180]   But while change is the law, certain great ideas flow fresh through the ages and control
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.660]   us effectually as in the days of Pericles.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:40.420]   Mankind, it has been said, is always advancing; man is always the same.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:48.100]   The love, hope, fear, and faith that make humanity and the elemental passions of the
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:54.220]   human heart remain unchanged, and the secret of inspiration in any literature is the capacity
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:31:02.340]   to touch the chord that vibrates in a sympathy that knows nor time nor place.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:08.660]   The quiet life in daytight compartments will help you to bear your own and others' burdens
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.820]   with a light heart.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.900]   Pay no heed to the Betrachians who sit croaking idly by the stream.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:22.020]   Life is a straight, plain business, and the way is clear, blazed for you by generations
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:28.580]   of strong men, into whose labors you enter and whose ideals must be your inspiration.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:35.340]   In my mind's eye I can see you twenty years hence, resolute-eyed, broad-headed, smooth-faced
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.740]   men who are in the world to make a success of life.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:44.220]   But to whichever of the two great types you belong, whether controlled by emotion or by
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:51.100]   reason, you will need the leaven of their spirit, the only leaven potent enough to avert
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.060]   that only-too-common nemesis to which the psalmist refers.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:03.340]   He gave them their heart's desire, but sent leanness withal into their souls.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.980]   I quoted Dr. Johnson's remark about the trivial things that influence.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:15.100]   Perhaps this slight word of mine may help some of you so to number your days that you
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:20.220]   may apply your hearts unto wisdom.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:26.300]   A Way of Life, an address to Yale students, Sunday evening, April 20, 1913, by William
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   Osler.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   Simpler's always better, right?
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   Right.
