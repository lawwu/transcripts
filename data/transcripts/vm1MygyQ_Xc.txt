[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   If you're not already earning 5% on all your cash,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.320]   including your checking account,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.920]   then by the end of this episode,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.740]   I hope you have everything you need
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.640]   to stop leaving money on the table
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.520]   and simplify your finances.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.480]   Almost every regular checking account,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.600]   Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.960]   they have all the features
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.880]   and all of them pay about 0% interest
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.240]   and are not directly connected to an account
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120]   that pays any meaningful amount.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   If you're wondering whether it's really worth switching,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   I guess it depends a little bit
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.520]   on how much cash you have,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.200]   but they're actually our accounts.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.720]   They have almost every feature of a checking account
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.880]   and earn 4% to 5% interest.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.400]   So what are these magical accounts?
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.880]   Hello, I'm Chris, and this is All The Hacks,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.080]   a channel about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.840]   And today we're focusing on bank accounts.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.880]   Now, there are thousands of checking
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.480]   and savings accounts out there.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.220]   I've looked at and even signed up
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.760]   for dozens of the best ones as research for this episode
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.320]   so that I can help you earn the most interest,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.280]   have a great bank account to operate your life out of,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880]   keep things simple, and have a great banking experience.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520]   And it's not purely altruistic.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.760]   I did a lot of this because I also wanted
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   to find the best bank account for me.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.160]   And the reason this is so hard
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.640]   is that most checking accounts
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.840]   pay almost 0% interest everywhere.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200]   And if there was a high-yield checking account
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.260]   that paid 4% to 5% interest,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.800]   this would be a really easy conversation.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.000]   There actually are plenty of accounts that say they do this,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.320]   but they're all filled with crazy requirements,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.860]   caps on earnings, and other gotchas.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.960]   For example, Fitness Bank is gonna give you 6%
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.040]   on your checking account
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.200]   as long as you average 10,000 steps a day
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.280]   and have 15 debit card transactions a month,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.560]   meaning not earning your credit card points,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.160]   and that rate only applies
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.280]   to the first $25,000 in your account.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.760]   If you can't hit your step goal
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.880]   or the card transaction goal, or you go over the limit,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.940]   you're dropped down to almost nothing.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.240]   Also, I found this bank, Primus, that claims around 5%
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.880]   and touts all these amazing things on the website.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.840]   But if you go read reviews online,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.600]   they're filled with rate drops after a few weeks,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   caps on withdrawals, funds getting held up,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.480]   and customer service phone numbers that never get answered.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.640]   So we're gonna skip banks like that
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.080]   and narrow the landscape down
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400]   to my top three recommendations.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.140]   But I'm also gonna share how I evaluate accounts,
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.780]   the ways that you can set up your accounts
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.840]   for maximum interest earning, and simplicity.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.620]   And at the end, I'll share my tips
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.040]   for automating your entire financial life.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.380]   I'm also gonna run through a few other accounts
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.040]   that didn't make the top three,
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.640]   but that you might already have,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.340]   and how you can tweak your setup with them to earn more.

[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.480]   and I'll do my best to reply to all of them.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.940]   Thank you so much in advance.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.140]   Let's get into it right after this.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.000]   So let's start with the features
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.040]   that you should be looking at
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.920]   when it comes to picking a primary bank account.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.360]   Some of these might be obvious,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.920]   some you might not have thought of,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   and some might matter to me, but not matter to you.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.880]   But the first one that I think is important to everyone
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.480]   is trustworthiness.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.520]   I need a financial institution that I can trust.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.640]   So to me, that doesn't just mean
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   that money is protected by the FDIC or SIPC insurance.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.080]   It also means that I can trust that the bank's
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.320]   not just gonna randomly shut down my account,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.780]   hold my funds, and do the kinds of things
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.120]   that after reading thousands of posts on Reddit,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000]   I think a lot of new banks do.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.600]   So when it comes to actual features,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.520]   here are the things that I think are required
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.420]   to make any bank account your primary bank account.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.640]   You need to get access to ACH account and routing numbers.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.840]   Those are absolutely necessary if you wanna go pay bills,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.300]   whether it's property tax or your credit cards.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.080]   If you don't have an account and routing number,
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.520]   you can't operate this like a primary bank.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.940]   Next is an ATM or debit card.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.500]   Now, I don't use the ATM that much, but when I'm traveling,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.600]   I think it's absolutely the best way
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   to get out foreign currency
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.640]   instead of trying to exchange money at the airport,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.960]   carry cash, or anything like that.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.200]   So I need a card that I can take money out of overseas,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.620]   ideally with those fees reimbursed, but not necessarily.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.960]   As for a debit card, I don't use my debit card that much,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.900]   so it's not that important to me,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.960]   but there is one cool thing that I sometimes like to do,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.060]   and that's if you purchase something on a credit card
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.320]   and you're returning it,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.460]   and the merchant lets you return that to a debit card
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.720]   instead of a credit card,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.040]   sometimes I'll do that so that the points I earned
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.980]   the first time don't get clawed back.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.920]   Next is some ability to send checks.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.600]   Now, that could be somewhere online
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.880]   where I could fill out a payee,
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.240]   and I could send money online,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.880]   and a check would get mailed to them.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.700]   It could be that I just get a checkbook,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.080]   and I can write checks the old-fashioned way.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.200]   Either one works, I just need a way to send a check.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.860]   I don't have to do it that often,
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.400]   but if I do have to do it,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.080]   there's usually not another option,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.120]   and I just need to have that option.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.800]   Next, because I'm married,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.160]   I need to have some type of joint access to the account.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.480]   Now, many banks offer joint accounts,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.320]   but some banks don't, but they do offer joint access,
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.380]   meaning a way for another person
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.760]   to get a debit card or an ATM card,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   to log in, to send transfers, and all those things.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   So whether it's a joint account or not
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.660]   might be a requirement for you,
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.320]   depending on your relationship,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.580]   but it's not absolutely necessary for me.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.760]   I also need the ability to do mobile deposit.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.580]   Every now and then, I get something like a tax refund,
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.880]   or a check in the mail,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.680]   and if I couldn't deposit that check in from my phone,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.200]   then I don't know what I would do,
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.920]   so I absolutely need that feature.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.640]   Next is reasonable limits.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   There are some accounts out there that I looked at
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.020]   that on the surface look great,
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.160]   except they might have limits like $5,000 a day,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.960]   or $10,000 a month,
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.260]   and if I'm not able to make the payments I need to regularly,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.760]   withdraw money as I need it, send it as I need it,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.080]   it would be a real big problem for me,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.880]   so reasonable limits are necessary.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.800]   Next is wire transfers.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.640]   Now, not everyone will have this requirement.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.160]   It's not something I do day-to-day, week-to-week,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.460]   or even month-to-month,
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.760]   but a few times a year,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.360]   I need the ability to make a wire transfer.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.840]   It might be related to business,
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.600]   it might be related to an investment.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.280]   I've had to do it a few times when we've bought a home,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.040]   and so that's absolutely something
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.420]   that I need access to do for my account.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.240]   Some banks charge a fee for it, some don't.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.860]   I'll get to, in a few seconds,
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.800]   about why the fees aren't as important to me at this point,
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.500]   but being able to send a wire transfer is important.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.880]   And then the last is I need some way
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.840]   to make recurring transfers to third parties.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.360]   So for us, we pay our au pair every week on Friday.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.040]   I need some way to automate that process.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.360]   I wanna be able to send money to her,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.480]   or if you have a gardener, or a cleaner,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.560]   or any other type of nanny or childcare,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.300]   and you wanna be able to make that payment regularly,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.440]   and the person you're paying
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.120]   doesn't have any type of automated billing system,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.380]   that's something that I really want.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.300]   I have had an account that had this service
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.600]   called PopMoney associated with it.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.340]   A lot of people use Zelle for this purpose.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.080]   And then there's other banks that have ways
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.800]   to set up recurring transfers.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.680]   Now, the important thing here is that it's to a third party.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.080]   There are many bank accounts
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.880]   that will let you set up recurring transfers
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.300]   between accounts titled in your name,
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.280]   but they won't let you set those transfers up
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.100]   to people whose names aren't titled on the account.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.600]   And so if you set up this account with a partner,
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.400]   and those kinds of transfers are important,
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.260]   then it might be really important to have a joint account
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.140]   that allows both people to be on the title,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.380]   so you can make those transfers.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.000]   For us, that's not a problem.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.920]   Now, there are a ton of bank accounts
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.380]   that offer all of those features.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.160]   In fact, most of the bank accounts you'll find do.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.020]   So what do we optimize for amongst all of them?
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.380]   What I'm looking for is my net after-tax yield.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.700]   Now, I could just say,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.540]   what's the amount of interest I'm earning?
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.980]   Is it 5%, 3%, 0%?
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.980]   And the reason I say net after-tax yield
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.520]   is two important things, the net and the after-tax.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.560]   So the net means subtracting fees.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.600]   If a bank had a really high interest rate,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.520]   but charged money for overseas ATM withdrawals,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   charged money for wires and transfers,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.680]   charged money for deposits or anything like that,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.160]   or had a monthly fee,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.680]   well, then that extra percent or two of yield
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.120]   doesn't really matter.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.480]   And then separate from that is after-tax.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.000]   And that's somewhat important
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.520]   because there are ways to earn interest on your cash
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.200]   that may, depending on what states you live in,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.700]   give you a better tax advantage result.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.760]   So for example, if you invest some of your cash
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.460]   in US treasuries or ETFs or mutual funds
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.120]   that invest in those treasuries,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.880]   the income from that might actually be state tax-free.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   So the ability to invest my cash
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.280]   in something that would be state tax-free
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.640]   is certainly an advantage,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.900]   which is why I'm gonna compare things as such.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.360]   Now, if there are some accounts
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.480]   that have all those features,
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.000]   they have the best interest rates
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.360]   and they're all pretty comparable,
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.560]   what are some tiebreakers that you might wanna consider
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.280]   when you're looking for an account?
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.000]   So one is simplicity.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.840]   I love keeping things simple.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   The ability to have a bank account
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.920]   at the same place as your brokerage account,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.200]   your retirement accounts, your 529, HSA,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.600]   credit cards, mortgage or auto loans,
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.560]   any of those things is great.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.120]   It's not a requirement,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.800]   but man, if it's neck and neck
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.140]   and one of them is more simple
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.500]   and I already have an account there, that'd be great.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.600]   Next is a good user experience.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.320]   That's like web UI, UX, does it feel modern?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.440]   Do they have a good mobile app?
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.840]   Is it a good experience using the product?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   That's really important.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.760]   Not a requirement, but really important.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.640]   Similar to that is whether the account
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.440]   actually works with aggregator sites.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.240]   So for example, there are a few services
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.400]   like Plaid, Yodlee, Finicity, MX,
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.440]   which is how you link your bank accounts
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.320]   to third-party services.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.480]   And so I use Copilot to track all of our finances
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.540]   and all of our spending.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.460]   I wanna be able to link my accounts to those services
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.220]   so that I can pull in those transactions
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.580]   without having to manually do that.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.380]   I would suggest trying to see if your account has this,
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.420]   if it works, and if it stays linked for a week
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.780]   before transitioning to any new bank account,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.860]   it's really important.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.220]   Might not be a requirement for you
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.780]   if you don't use any of those services,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.940]   but I'm always testing out new products.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.240]   And so having that is really important to me.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.400]   Not a deal breaker if it's a bad bank account,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.820]   but something I'd love.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.900]   Next is the ability to title your account in a trust.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.700]   Now, a lot of people set up revocable trusts
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.100]   so that they're able to give a little bit more control
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.820]   over where their assets go, where they'd pass away.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.060]   And also because if you have money
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.580]   over a certain threshold in a lot of states,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.720]   your estate goes through probate,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.380]   which is effectively a type of court
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.140]   where a judge is assigned
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.940]   and gets to determine where things get allocated,
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.460]   oftentimes aligned with your intent from your will
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.620]   or something like that.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.500]   But it's just a process that costs money and takes time
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.300]   and in many states, a public record.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.980]   So I'd love to avoid that.
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.700]   So if you have more assets
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.420]   than whatever your limit is in your state,
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.460]   I think in California, it's about $185,000.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.340]   You might want a trust account.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.960]   However, keep in mind, and I am not a lawyer,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.540]   but if the majority of your assets are titled in a trust
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.980]   and just one account that is under that limit
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.420]   is not in the trust,
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.380]   you will usually be just fine avoiding probate courts.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.220]   And there's something called a pour-over will
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.720]   that would basically say anything
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.800]   that I didn't title in my trust, allow it to transfer over.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.260]   Now, these kinds of trusts,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.900]   these revocable trusts that I'm talking about,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.060]   these are not these fancy kinds of trusts
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.520]   that people set up for asset protection or tax avoidance.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.580]   They're very different.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.620]   I did a whole episode on trusts.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.700]   You can go back and listen to.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.140]   We did go into some of these kind of unique trusts
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.860]   that are usually not revocable.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.220]   They're irrevocable,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.940]   but that's just something to keep in mind.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.420]   Next, I mentioned the ability to send checks,
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.500]   but if all things are equal
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.940]   and I could also get a checkbook for the one or two times
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.300]   that it might come in handy, great, not a hard requirement.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.740]   I guess the backup to that would be
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.140]   if you really need to send a check,
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.860]   you could go get a money order without having a bank account.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.380]   Another feature that I really like,
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.420]   but I'm not gonna put in the required bucket
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.000]   is the ability to set up savings buckets.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.500]   So the ability to create different areas
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.860]   for different types of cash.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.260]   So maybe you're setting aside money for tuition
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.080]   or an emergency fund or to pay off a certain loan,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.140]   the ability to kind of virtually set that up
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.940]   or spin up other accounts to segregate that money
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.140]   would be really a feature that I would like to have,
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.700]   but I don't need.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.940]   Automation is another one,
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.940]   just ways that you can automate more in your financial life.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.540]   Next is a high FDIC insurance limit.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.920]   Now, this usually doesn't matter
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.060]   because most financial institutions,
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.980]   if not all of them that are registered
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.500]   as banks in the United States have a $250,000 limit
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   that actually is per person on the account.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.300]   So if it's a joint account with two people,
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.320]   it would actually go up to 500,000.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.200]   I don't know about you guys,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.320]   but I usually don't keep that much money in cash at all,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.920]   but it could be relevant
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.400]   if you're saving for something large,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.440]   like a down payment for a home or something like that.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.920]   And so if an account had a higher FDIC limit,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.080]   that'd be great.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.920]   And then last, Zelle is a feature
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.760]   that I don't use that often.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.680]   I have used it in the past.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.760]   If a bank had Zelle, it would be a bonus for me.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.560]   Though there is a hack that I'll share,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.860]   which is that the Zelle app lets you use a debit card
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.180]   of a bank that doesn't support Zelle
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.060]   to send payments with Zelle.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.580]   It does have lower limits
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.780]   and it can't set up recurring payments.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.020]   But if you do need to send money over Zelle
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.380]   and you don't have Zelle built into your bank,
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.420]   you can use it in that way.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.960]   So that's a lot of features, I know.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.700]   I actually have a table that I'm looking at right now,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.220]   and it has all these features across 39 different rows,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.580]   20 different accounts that I narrowed down to.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.040]   And I'm gonna reference some of the things in this table
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.120]   as I go through this conversation.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.880]   But I recently got a few requests
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.500]   from all the Hacks members
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.560]   to share more of this kind of research
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.580]   that I'm doing with members.
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.080]   So starting with this episode,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.600]   I'm gonna do two new things
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.120]   every time I do a solo deep dive.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.520]   And I'm gonna, one, share that spreadsheet.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.520]   I'm gonna share the research with members
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.960]   that I use to organize all of my research.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.120]   And two, I'm actually gonna schedule a call
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.060]   with all of our members where people can go deeper,
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.320]   ask me questions on anything I've covered today,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.760]   or maybe even didn't cover.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.480]   If you're interested in becoming All The Hacks member,
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.440]   you can do that at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.880]   Okay, now let's jump into the accounts,
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.480]   and there are a few different types.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.100]   So a couple that I'm gonna say
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.160]   are worth mentioning briefly because they do exist,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   but are not eligible for this conversation
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.700]   because they just don't have the features
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.080]   to be your primary bank account.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.240]   The first are accounts focused just on savings.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.280]   And so there are a handful of banks out there
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.000]   that have either high-yield savings accounts only,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.260]   or banks like M1 or Titan or Public
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.180]   that have savings accounts that earn high interest,
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.180]   might even have really high FDIC insurance,
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.020]   but they don't give you all the functionality
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.420]   to make them your primary bank.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.940]   M1 is another one,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.100]   and then the Vanguard Cash Plus account is another one.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.460]   It actually does give you the ACH numbers you need
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.580]   to direct deposit and pay bills, but that's it.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.980]   There aren't all the other features
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.720]   that you need for a primary bank.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.660]   Now, if I did need an account just to earn interest on cash,
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.140]   I probably wouldn't go with any of these.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.900]   I'd probably just go with a brokerage account
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.680]   where I can invest in treasury ETFs or index funds,
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.420]   or even treasuries themselves,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.020]   and get an even better after-tax return
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.760]   because of the state tax advantage,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.200]   at least for me living in California.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.620]   Or I'm pretty intrigued
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.460]   with the Wealthfront Automated Bond Ladder
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.500]   they just launched.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.040]   I have not gone deep on it, so I can't talk in much detail,
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.180]   but at a minimum,
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.740]   it's worth checking out the calculator they've built,
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.080]   even if you're not interested in the product,
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.280]   because what they do is they take your income,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.380]   they take your state, your tax filing situation,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.560]   and they show you what an amount of treasury interest
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.580]   would need to match from an account
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.340]   that didn't have that tax advantage.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.940]   So for example, they show that earning 5.21%
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.420]   in treasury interest for someone in California
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.740]   earning a lot of money is about the same
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.800]   as earning 6.17% in fully taxed interest,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.860]   which by the way, is higher than every single account
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.340]   I'm going to mention today.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.220]   So if you have a very large amount of cash
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.300]   that you're saving,
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.460]   that you want to be earning interest on,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.940]   that is the path I would take
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.220]   over any high-yield savings account or anything similar.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.760]   Also, one other thing to keep in mind broadly
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.340]   when it comes to interest rates
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.860]   is that usually most of these banks
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.300]   are changing their interest rates
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.900]   relative to the effective federal funds rate.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.940]   And when that rate goes down at a different Fed meeting,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.500]   they might decide to cut rates
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.240]   or cut the guidance for rates,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.140]   banks will drop their rates accordingly.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.060]   Now they don't all drop them at the exact same day,
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.900]   and you might find that some accounts
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.440]   look like they're earning a little bit more
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.860]   for a little bit longer.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.980]   I just want to point out that the time in transit
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.020]   between banks, you're usually not earning any return.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.100]   And so we actually did some analysis
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.260]   when I was working at Wealthfront,
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.160]   and they found that if someone were rate chasing
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.000]   throughout the year,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.080]   trying to get the highest rate at a given point in time,
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.460]   they actually would have lost about 13% of their return
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.640]   due to the fact that they were spending so many days
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.000]   uninvested because they were moving their money
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.300]   between institutions.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.200]   So finding a bank that consistently pays high rates
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.640]   and not bouncing around can often be a much better outcome.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.420]   Okay, so that's high yield savings accounts.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.800]   Not something we're gonna cover,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.680]   not something you can operate out of.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.760]   The other account that I wouldn't suggest,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.880]   but you can operate out of that doesn't meet my criteria
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.440]   is almost every regular checking account.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.720]   Now I've had ones at Wells Fargo, Bank of America,
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.420]   Chase, even JP Morgan, First Republic,
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.800]   SVB, which is now First Citizens.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.400]   I've had the chance to have some of those
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.040]   at the bank's private bank practice,
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.960]   and then some of them are just regular accounts,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.600]   and they're pretty much all the same.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.460]   They have all the features I talked about,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.280]   checkbooks, account routing numbers, debit ATM cards,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.320]   bill pay, most of them have Zelle,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.800]   and all of them pay about 0% interest
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.200]   and are not directly connected to an account
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.340]   that pays any meaningful amount of interest.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.880]   The only advantage I can give you for these banks
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.160]   is that they do have branches.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   So if you need to go into a branch, you can.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.280]   Sometimes on the higher end side,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.000]   what I've seen from private banks
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.900]   is you get a lot more support.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.000]   If you're looking for someone to help give you guidance
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.320]   or set up complicated tax or investment strategies,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.160]   they can often be very helpful.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.340]   They usually have no fees and fee reimbursements
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.560]   at higher limits.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.940]   But when it comes to earning yield
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.440]   on a cash operating account, like a checking account,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.420]   I have never seen one at a regular financial institution
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.300]   that has banks around every corner,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.740]   at least not in their primary checking accounts.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.540]   Now, if those accounts don't make sense,
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.920]   what does make sense?
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.780]   Now, at the very beginning of this episode,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.820]   I said, unfortunately,
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.260]   I couldn't find a high-yield checking account
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260]   that didn't have caps or all these problems
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.460]   or issues with holding accounts.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.580]   So you can't just find a high-yield checking account.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.820]   That would make our lives too easy.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.080]   So the general idea of what makes this super optimal
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.800]   is operating out of a savings account
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.840]   that has as many checking features as possible
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.800]   or can link directly
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.840]   with some type of overdraft protection
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.020]   to a checking account.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.540]   Now, one thing important to understand
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.720]   is that the Federal Reserve used to have this rule
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.280]   called Regulation D.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.740]   And that rule limited the withdrawals and transfers
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.440]   from savings accounts to six per month,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.900]   which made it really difficult
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.000]   for you to use a savings account as a primary account.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.720]   Now, that was there to ensure
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.360]   that banks maintained adequate reserves,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.200]   but when the pandemic happened,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.760]   they temporarily lifted this limit.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.440]   And then by the end of 2020,
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.400]   they actually removed it entirely.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   Now, individual banks can still choose
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.920]   to enforce these limits,
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.960]   but they are not required at a federal level.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.400]   So what you can do is you can find a savings account,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.760]   and I'm gonna talk about all the ones that work,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.180]   where you can operate completely
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.400]   out of that savings account,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.940]   where you can earn interest on all the cash at a high rate
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.160]   and get most of the features you need,
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.780]   some form of bill pay, account routing numbers,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.520]   and all of those things,
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.420]   but have a checking account set up
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.740]   at that same institution that's connected
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.620]   with overdraft protection,
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.740]   which would allow you to keep
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.180]   that checking account balance at zero,
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.920]   but be able to overdraw it
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.540]   by however much money is in your savings account.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.840]   So it's not a perfect all-in-one solution,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.780]   and I'm actually gonna get
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.180]   to a few of those solutions after this,
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.620]   but it's a really good solution
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.020]   that works at a lot of different institutions.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.300]   Now, keep in mind, a lot of institutions,
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.180]   but not all institutions.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   So for example, Betterment, UFB, Laurel Road, and Amex
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.180]   all have high-yield savings accounts
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.780]   connected to a checking account,
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.540]   but there's no overdraft protection.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.980]   So if you wanted to pay a bill
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.780]   or if you wanted to take money out of an ATM
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.060]   or spend your debit card,
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.660]   you would have to leave a balance in your checking account
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.960]   to be able to cover that.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.520]   And so it doesn't allow you to operate entirely
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.280]   out of a savings account.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.600]   And why is this important?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.440]   Well, if you have to leave a bunch of money
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.120]   in an account earning no interest,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.740]   it really can cost you.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.800]   So if you don't wanna leave $1,000 on the table,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.660]   assuming that's the balance that you keep,
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.280]   you wanna find an account that has these overdraft features.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.720]   Now, the only other account that I'll mention
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.880]   that doesn't have them,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.040]   that I have heard some people talk about is Acorns.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.840]   And the reason why it's a little bit interesting
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.000]   is that they do have 5% savings
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.480]   and 3% checking.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.520]   So you're not earning nothing on checking.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.800]   So you could argue that maybe this is a good fit.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.000]   However, it's missing so many features.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.340]   There are no wires in and out.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.980]   There's no checks, no joint accounts, no overdraft.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.920]   It costs $60 a year,
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.480]   has very, very low transfer limits.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.240]   $7,000 in and out a day and 50,000 in and out a month,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.560]   $5,000 cap on mobile deposits and a $500 limit on ATMs.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.360]   So I went in thinking that could be an option.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.600]   I left thinking it is definitely not a good option,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.200]   at least for my use case.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.400]   As for the banks where there is a good option,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.120]   there are four that are very, very similar.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.840]   SoFi, Capital One, Discover and CIT.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.480]   Now, all of them are paying between 4% and 5% interest.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   And they all have all the main features you need,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   sending checks, depositing,
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.880]   being able to open a joint account,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.840]   using Zelle,
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.200]   which actually just got launched to SoFi a couple days ago.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.460]   And so on the surface,
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.800]   these are all really, really good options.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.280]   Where are they different though?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.960]   So obviously the interest rates are different.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.520]   At the time of publishing, CIT is at 5%,
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.520]   SoFi is at 4.6, Capital One and Discover are both at 4.25%.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.200]   So where things are a bit different,
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.520]   I'm gonna take a look at the spreadsheet,
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.120]   is when it comes to wires.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.000]   So, SoFi, for example, has $0 wires,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.380]   but they only let you wire money for home purchases.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.240]   So you can't send money to other people.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.160]   Capital One has wires, they cost $30.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.760]   Discover has $30 wires,
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.160]   but you need to give them two to three days notice.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.520]   CIT will give you wires for $10 or $0
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.100]   if your balance is over 25,000.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.820]   But you need to upload a form,
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.880]   and I have no idea how long that would take.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.520]   Another place that was a little bit different
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.760]   was transfer limits.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.320]   Most of them are pretty similar.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.840]   They have plenty of room for ATM withdrawals
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.000]   and daily in and out transfers.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.840]   However, SoFi, I'm looking at my notes here,
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.240]   I just did a transfer where I didn't even complete it.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.520]   I just typed in an amount
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.440]   and it told me how long it would take.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.800]   And so I put in $25,000 to see what it would say.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.720]   And it said that $4,900 would come today,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.960]   $3,000 would come in four days,
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.080]   and the rest would come in five days.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.400]   So I'm not sure if that's just because it was a new account
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.280]   or what would happen.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.400]   I couldn't find any publishing
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.200]   of all of the details of those transfer limits.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   So I just say like slight, you know,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.640]   yellow flag there for the SoFi account.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.800]   They also have a maximum $5,000 for bill pay.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.000]   So if you're regularly sending checks,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.560]   that could come into a problem
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   if you need to send checks over $5,000.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.200]   Otherwise, the accounts were pretty similar.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.920]   CIT and Capital One looks like they allowed you
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.960]   to open up a trust account, which was cool.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.480]   When it comes to FDIC limits,
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.240]   SoFi was the only one of those four
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.900]   that had higher than $250,000 limit,
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.920]   but you had to manually go into the settings page
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.120]   and enable it.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.600]   You couldn't just get it by default,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.260]   which is just kind of annoying.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.080]   Also CIT, when it came to reviews,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.740]   is one that I would say proceed with caution
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.720]   and do your homework.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.440]   It seemed like there were a lot of negative reviews
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.800]   and positive reviews,
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.160]   as opposed to mostly positive everywhere else,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.400]   mostly around account suspensions and holds.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.680]   So I'd wanna dig a little deeper
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.960]   if I were gonna go that path.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.640]   Finally, when it comes to transfer limits,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.880]   SoFi was very explicit.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.120]   They said, "We do not have a transfer limit
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.140]   on our savings account," which was nice.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.920]   Capital One and Discover, on the other hand,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.420]   in a lot of messages, people keep getting notices
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.460]   that they're over six transactions a month
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.720]   in their savings account,
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.760]   but so many people said they've been getting these notices
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.240]   for a few years and it's never been enforced
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.000]   that I feel reasonably confident
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.760]   that they're not gonna just start enforcing it
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.880]   all of a sudden,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.760]   but they don't explicitly call out
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.840]   that they don't have those limits.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.280]   So that's a bit of the differences.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.080]   There's a couple others in this bucket
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.520]   that I think are worth calling out,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   but they're a little bit different.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.080]   Ally is one that is very popular
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.200]   amongst a lot of people I talk to.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.280]   They have a savings account at 4.2%
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.140]   and a checking account at 0.25%.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.860]   And it's very close to being able to do
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.800]   what we've talked about,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.740]   except that those overdrafts from checking to savings
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.180]   are limited to 10 times per month.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.100]   And people I know with Ally accounts
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.940]   get a lot more aggressive notes
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   about using their savings account to pay bills.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.260]   And so if you have a lot of transactions
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.000]   coming in and out of your accounts,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.500]   I feel like this could become a problem for you.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.220]   That said, they do have joint trust accounts and Zelle
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.040]   and some really great savings bucket features.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.780]   So I think it's an option,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.460]   but that limiting overdraft
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.940]   is a little bit of a problem for me.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.260]   And at 4.2%, I'm still wondering
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.980]   where is the magic account that can get you 5%.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.140]   And I'm about to talk a few that will.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.200]   So Robinhood is gonna give you 5% on savings
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.060]   and 0% on checking.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.860]   Now, the reason this is slightly separate
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.820]   is it's a lot different than the ones I mentioned before.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.180]   So first off, if you remember,
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.580]   Robinhood used to have a cash management account
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.060]   that paid interest and gave you checking features.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.140]   Well, they got rid of that
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.700]   and now they have an investing account
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.140]   and a spending account.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.100]   And the investing account earns you 5%
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.700]   on your entire balance.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.340]   You do need to have Robinhood Gold
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.360]   to get that interest rate, so it's $50 a year.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.100]   You get 2.25 million in FDIC coverage
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.420]   and some of the features of a checking account.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.540]   You've got an ACH account and routing number
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.080]   so you can pay bills and deposit money from your paycheck.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.420]   You've got bill pay, you can send wires,
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.420]   but you don't get an ATM card.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.140]   They do have a spending account that earns no interest,
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.340]   but does give you an ATM card.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.860]   And funny enough, you can only overdraw the spending account
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.900]   with ATM and debit transactions.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.100]   So if you were to hit that spending account
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.580]   with a bill pay for your credit card bill,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.820]   it is going to bounce,
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.420]   even if you have enough money in your savings account.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.420]   They also have a pretty low limit at $510 for ATM withdrawals.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.620]   Now, I noticed a lot of these new banks
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.940]   had a $510 ATM limit, even some of the other older banks.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.500]   And I believe the reason for that
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.940]   is that they wanna make sure that they say,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.780]   you can take out 500, the $10 is to cover the ATM fees.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.900]   The one feature they're missing is there's no mobile deposit.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.340]   So it's a little messy
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.140]   in that you've got to operate these two accounts
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.540]   and there's some rules about how you use them
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.940]   and a low ATM fee, but on the bonus,
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.860]   the investing account does earn 5%
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.420]   and lets you invest that money in a brokerage account.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.900]   Now you might want that to be separate.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.000]   You might want your brokerage account separate
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.900]   from your cash account, which I think I would.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.760]   So for me, this would be a little bit messy,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.100]   but it does get you up to that 5% interest here,
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.940]   which I think is better
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.740]   than all of the ones we just talked about,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.660]   except CIT, which has its fair share of issues.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.980]   But then again, you've got to decide
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.720]   whether Robinhood has those issues for you also
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.660]   based on how you feel about that institution.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.580]   I know there are a lot of people
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.820]   that have some strong feelings there.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.260]   Also, I think it's important to mention
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.400]   that the Robinhood investing account is not a bank account.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.840]   It is a brokerage account.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.260]   And the FDIC is what backs up bank accounts.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.920]   CIPIC or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.580]   is what backs up your brokerage account,
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.480]   but it doesn't back up all of the securities.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.780]   It usually just backs up the cash in the account,
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.380]   but has similar limits, usually at around $500,000.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.340]   Now, a few things that are a little bit different
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.700]   between these two, because for a lot of people,
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.040]   they're kind of one in the same,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.740]   but I did see a lot of people chiming in online about,
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.900]   "No, no, no, you need your money in a bank."
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.400]   One of those reasons is that banks
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.100]   are just more heavily regulated than brokerage firms.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.540]   So they have higher reserves.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.220]   You can file complaints with the CFPB for banks,
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.740]   but I don't think you can for brokerage firms.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.060]   But one thing that kind of at least resonates with me
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.100]   is that if you have all of your money in a bank
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.700]   and there were major problems and a major bank went under,
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.340]   FDIC is ultimately backed up by the US government.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.380]   The FDIC does have a fund to back up,
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.620]   but it is not enough that if all banks collapsed,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.340]   it would be there to protect everyone.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.060]   Now, if your money that is sitting in your brokerage firm
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.780]   as cash is invested in US government securities,
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.500]   then you're also just relying on the full faith and credit
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.800]   of the US government, just in a different way.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.820]   So between your cash position being covered by CIPIC
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.340]   and if you're invested in US treasuries,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.320]   you're kind of in a situation where you're also just backed
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.500]   by the US government in a different method.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.440]   One more thing that I know someone will mention
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.220]   is that when your money is sitting in a brokerage account,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.340]   if it's being held at money market funds,
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.300]   it is possible for the value
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.440]   of those money market funds to drop.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.420]   Now, it's called breaking the buck
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.340]   and it actually happened in 2008 and people did lose money.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.220]   Now, it looks from my research like everyone got back
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.420]   somewhere between 97 and 99% of their money,
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.260]   so it wasn't a massive loss.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.060]   So having your money in a money market fund
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.440]   is not a guarantee, but those money market funds
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.460]   were not solely invested in US government securities.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.380]   The reason that they lost money is that they were holding
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.860]   a financial instrument called commercial paper
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.140]   and they were holding Lehman Brothers commercial paper,
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.240]   which ultimately is why they lost value,
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.020]   because the value of Lehman Brothers went to zero overnight.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.060]   So I think if you are invested in a money market fund
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.620]   that is solely invested in US government securities,
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.300]   you're probably in a better financial situation.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.900]   But again, I am not a financial advisor, a CPA, a lawyer,
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.800]   so this is just my own opinion and my own personal thoughts.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.140]   So I just wanted to cover that
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.620]   because there are a couple more options
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.760]   that I think are focused on brokerage
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.840]   that are really interesting.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.120]   And one of the most loved accounts, when you look online,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.500]   when you talk to people about amazing bank accounts,
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.620]   people consistently talk about the Schwab checking account.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.620]   And the primary reason is that it seems like Schwab
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.900]   pioneered reimbursing ATM fees worldwide.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.980]   And so for those people who travel internationally,
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.180]   who know that withdrawing money from an ATM
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.340]   is usually the best way to get a good conversion rate
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.440]   and get foreign currency easily,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.260]   people love the Schwab account.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.520]   Now, the downside is that it only earns 0.48%
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.220]   in your checking account.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.580]   Now, the majority of people with a Schwab checking account
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.100]   probably also have a Schwab brokerage account,
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.820]   which is probably where most assets at Schwab
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.860]   are being held.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.180]   So you do have a place that you can earn higher yield.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.960]   It's not a simple higher yield
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.660]   in that you just put money in the account and it earns,
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.060]   you need to invest that money in something,
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.580]   whether that's a money market fund
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.460]   invested in US treasuries or something else.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.900]   It could be municipals to try to get even more tax advantage.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.180]   It could be stocks,
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.700]   but you do need to have that money invested.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.240]   And it is linked,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.400]   but there's not really any overdraw protection.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.940]   So it kind of doesn't meet the requirements that I have
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.820]   of being able to have an account that earns high yield
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.280]   and being able to operate out of that account.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.240]   Now, the only reason I include it is because one,
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.200]   people seem to love it.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.260]   It also gives you a checkbook, Zelle, joint trust accounts.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.440]   Technically, they do have overdraft.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.080]   So I felt like I needed to include it in this list,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.520]   both because of its popularity
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.560]   and because technically you can overdraw
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.400]   that checking account.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.640]   So you could leave the balance at zero.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.000]   However, instead of overdrawing
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.340]   and selling your cash position
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.260]   or selling your cash-like money market funds,
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.160]   they draw on margin against your brokerage balance
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.720]   and they take out a loan
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.440]   that you need to transfer money back to pay off.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.160]   Now, if that money is only borrowed for a couple of days,
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.140]   then it probably isn't a massive amount of interest,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.840]   but it's just, in my opinion, pretty messy, right?
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.040]   Every time you wanna hit your checking account,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.160]   you're ending up drawing a margin line,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.680]   then you're paying off the margin loan
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   and transferring money.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.720]   It's not automated at all.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.240]   Now, they do also charge for wires at $15
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   unless you have a balance over 100,000.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.460]   In which case you get three free per quarter
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.040]   or all your wires are free over a million dollars.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.720]   So as much as I think people love the Schwab account,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.000]   I think there are some way better options.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.800]   Okay, I'm saving the best for last
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.320]   in this group of savings accounts
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.880]   that you can operate out of with a link checking account.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.960]   And this is Mercury.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.520]   And Mercury's historically focused all on business accounts,
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   but they just launched personal accounts
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.640]   and I've had a chance to use it for the past month
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.680]   and it's really, really impressive.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.420]   And what they've done that's so unique
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.200]   is that they've added a lot of the features
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.940]   of a business checking account
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.720]   to a personal checking account.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.280]   So that means you can spin up multiple users,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.080]   you can give access to a bookkeeper,
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.960]   you can give access to your assistant,
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.800]   you can spin up multiple cards.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.960]   So you could even create a virtual card
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.680]   or a physical debit card for a nanny.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.520]   You could even lock that card to specific merchant.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   So you could say, here is a card
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.920]   that only works at Whole Foods up to $500 a month.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.240]   They also have a lot of other features
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.880]   when it comes to sending and receiving money.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.140]   One of which is really important to me
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.100]   is to be able to set up recurring transfers to third parties.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.640]   So our au pair was able to say,
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.920]   here's my account routing number at Chase.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.520]   And I was able to set up a recurring weekly transfer
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.520]   to pay her.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.960]   To make that easy, they can also generate a URL
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.380]   that you can send someone
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.680]   that allows them to fill out banking information
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.800]   so that they can either send you money
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.640]   or so that you can receive money to them
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.540]   or push money to them.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.300]   Lots of options there.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.080]   You can also upload bills.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.480]   So let's say you're working on a home renovation project
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.320]   and a contractor sends you a bill, you can upload it.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.280]   They'll OCR it, figure out the amounts
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.400]   and they can mail a checkout for that bill.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.240]   They also reimburse ATM fees.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.680]   You get up to $5 million of FDIC insurance,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.360]   free same day transfers with ACH, free wires.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.800]   And best of all, that savings account earns 5%.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.240]   And they actually have this feature
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.760]   on the business account called Mercury Treasury
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.100]   where you're able to move money to another account
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.400]   that earns yield on US treasuries.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.760]   And so I've been told
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.000]   that they're gonna be launching that feature soon,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   which would give you another savings bucket
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.240]   that you could use to potentially get a higher
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.320]   and taxed advantage to yield.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.360]   So really excited about that.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.220]   And the last unique feature that they have
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.040]   is a lot of different types of automations
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.560]   where you can set up specific rules
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.620]   and have things happen every single day.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.280]   And one of those is to leave a target balance in an account.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.440]   So I mentioned that most of these accounts have overdraft
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.180]   between checking and savings.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.240]   This account does not, but they do have automation.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.360]   And so what I've done is I've set up,
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.140]   hey, leave my checking balance at $400,
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.160]   which earns 0%, but cost me about $20 a year.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.300]   And anytime that balance goes down or up,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.960]   just level it off using the money in my savings account
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.400]   back to 400.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.520]   What this does,
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.200]   because I don't actually use the checking account
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.640]   for really anything other than a potential ATM withdrawal,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.580]   it allows me to be able to use my ATM card just in case
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.660]   if I need cash and then top that back up to 400.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.300]   So it doesn't have that overdraft functionality,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.940]   but because you can pay all your bills
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.040]   from your savings account,
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.580]   because you can deposit your paycheck
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.760]   to your savings account,
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.860]   you don't really need the checking account
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.260]   for anything more than ATMs or debit cards.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.660]   And I'm not really using my debit card,
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.500]   so it's just kind of an ATM issue.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.140]   And if I were needing to withdraw more than $400,
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.860]   it would probably take me 20 seconds in the app
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.620]   to move some extra money over.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.180]   And because that automation runs daily at night,
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.840]   it's not something that's instantly gonna get moved back.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.100]   So if I needed to take out $1,000,
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.980]   I could transfer over 600, withdraw 1,000,
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.900]   and that night it would get topped back up to $400.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.260]   So what's the downside?
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.020]   The downside is that Mercury is charging a $240 annual fee
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.980]   for their personal banking product.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.340]   Now, even for me, I was like, what?
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.260]   How are you possibly charging a fee?
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.940]   None of these other banks charge fees,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.440]   especially these banks that offer lots of premium services.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.540]   But at the end of the day,
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.620]   I really would love this product to exist,
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.420]   so I kind of understand it.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.660]   And they're offering 5% interest,
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.460]   which is better than almost every other bank out there.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.260]   So it seems like for the set of features and the interest,
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.460]   there is no other account that offers this.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.940]   So maybe you could argue that fee is justified.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.900]   If it saves you even a couple of hours a year,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.660]   then I guess you could say it's made up for in that reason.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.820]   Or if you look at how many dollars
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.780]   that you would need to have earning 5% interest
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.220]   relative to 0%, it's about $5,000,
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.300]   and you'd pay the annual fee right away.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.500]   So if you're leaving $5,000
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.000]   just in a Chase checking account earning zero,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.620]   well then I guess earning 5% in the Mercury Savings account
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.380]   would do better than that.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.080]   Few other cons, there's no joint accounts yet.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.020]   Right now it says coming soon.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.620]   Because you can spin up a login for your spouse,
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.860]   because you can create a debit card for your spouse
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.800]   and let them set up transfers and do all those things,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.300]   I'm not sure how big of a deal that is.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.900]   Like I mentioned, there's no Overdraft and there's no Zelle,
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.220]   but I have used my Mercury debit card with the Zelle app,
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.380]   so that works there.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.940]   So the idea of having a savings account to operate out of
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.980]   and a checking account with a few hundred dollars
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.620]   or even zero dollars just in case you need to use an ATM card
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.780]   is a pretty compelling solution.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.620]   However, wouldn't it be great if you could have one account?
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.100]   Well, I said there is no perfect
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.900]   all-in-one high-yield checking account,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.560]   but there actually are three accounts,
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.220]   none of which are checking accounts,
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.940]   but that function almost just like one.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.460]   They have almost every feature of a checking account
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.700]   and earn 4% to 5% interest.
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.960]   So what are these magical accounts?
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.380]   Well, there's actually a fourth one
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.460]   and it didn't quite meet all the requirements,
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.740]   but I just wanna mention it in case anyone listening
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.700]   sends a lot of money internationally.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.740]   And that's that Wise, which used to be called TransferWise,
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.820]   has an account that earns 4.85% interest,
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.900]   gives you an account routing number, ATM cards,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.740]   huge transfer limits,
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.020]   and makes it really easy to send money overseas
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.140]   to lots of different currencies.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.980]   Downside, really low limits on the ATM card
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.420]   before paying fees, I think it's like $100 a day,
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.520]   there's no bill pay or mobile deposit,
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.640]   and even every transfer has a fee,
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.000]   but probably only relevant
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.700]   if you send a lot of money overseas.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.000]   So let's jump into the three all-in-one accounts.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.740]   Let's start with the one that I've been using
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.640]   for a long time,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.140]   and that's the Wealthfront Individual Cash Account.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.180]   Right now it's paying 5% interest,
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.980]   has $8 million of FDIC insurance,
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.500]   they have automated savings,
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.300]   they have savings buckets called cash categories
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.760]   where you could separate money, you can send checks,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.500]   got same day ACH, seven days a week,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.980]   365 days a year if you need to withdraw money
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.500]   to another account,
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.580]   you get an ATM card, account routing numbers,
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.300]   everything works from this account
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.360]   like you would expect with a few small things.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.960]   One, if you opt to open a Wealthfront Cash Account
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.480]   that is a trust or a joint account,
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.560]   you don't get any of these checking features.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.520]   So the checking features are tied solely
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.200]   to an individual cash account.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.680]   Two, there are wires,
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.240]   but you can only wire money to yourself
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.040]   or to an escrow or title company
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.080]   for the purchase of a home.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.520]   So if you do need to wire money to make an investment
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.920]   or to someone else, it's not gonna be possible.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.560]   Transfer limits are pretty good,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.220]   but I will note that the transfer out limit for ACH pulls,
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.580]   meaning if you were to make a payment online to the IRS
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.100]   or a credit card is at $50,000.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.140]   So if you are making really large payments to the IRS,
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.820]   you might have some problems here.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.540]   Otherwise, it's been an amazing account to operate out of.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.140]   They don't reimburse ATM fees,
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.140]   but you are earning 5% interest.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.340]   You can even earn 5.5% interest if you make a referral
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.640]   or you're referred to the product.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.340]   And so I've used this account for a handful of years.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.380]   The automation in it,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.300]   I'm gonna talk about at the end of this episode
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.540]   when I talk about automating your finances,
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.180]   and it's really been a great account.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.300]   The lack of the ability to have two logins or two ATM cards
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.700]   could be a really big deal breaker
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.300]   for someone operating their finances with a partner.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.460]   Next is the U.S. Bank Elite Money Market Account.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.940]   Now it pays 4.25% interest.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.820]   Seems they have ATM reimbursements.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.580]   You get a checkbook, debit card.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.300]   They even have a checking account
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.760]   that will overdraft into this account,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.260]   but it's not clear why you would need it
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.560]   because it seems like you could do everything you want
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.400]   out of this account.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.200]   You get routing numbers, you can send wires,
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.280]   all of those things.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.540]   The only downside is that there just aren't
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.160]   that many details about it.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   I looked online, I searched Reddit,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.500]   I went as far as to almost open the account,
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.600]   and I did not do that yet, so that is one caveat.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.800]   But I couldn't find details on transfer limits
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.820]   and nuances about a lot of things.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.480]   And the only reason I didn't keep going
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.800]   is 'cause at 4.25%, it just didn't seem worth it.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.600]   It is a great all-in-one account.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.360]   I guess if you want a bank that has branches
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.080]   and you live near U.S. Bank,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.860]   then maybe it could be a great option
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.200]   if you need to go to a branch
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.640]   and you just want one account at one institution,
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.440]   or maybe you're already using U.S. Bank for other things.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.880]   Otherwise, I would love to optimize for an account
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.560]   where I'm earning closer to 5% than 4%.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.360]   And the last is an account that I think a lot of people
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.280]   on the internet seem to all know about,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.840]   but almost everyone I talk to in real life
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.260]   has never heard of,
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.760]   and that is the Fidelity Cash Management account.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.280]   And with this, you get an account
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.440]   that has pretty much everything you need.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.000]   Free wires, ATM reimbursements worldwide,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.380]   joint trust accounts, checkbooks, high transfer limits,
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.320]   all the other things, bill pay,
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.080]   account routing numbers, everything.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.400]   And all of your cash
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.200]   in the Fidelity Cash Management account earns interest,
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.520]   and you get to choose your core position.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.280]   Now, as of recording, the only fund that you can choose
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.520]   for the cash management account earns less than 3%.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.040]   However, they have announced that on June 15th, 2024,
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.620]   which will be before this episode even comes out,
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.260]   you'll be able to choose SPAXX,
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.400]   which is a Fidelity government money market fund.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.800]   I'm looking at it right now.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.760]   It's held mostly in treasury bills,
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.440]   U.S. government repurchase agreements,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.560]   and agency floating rate securities.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.360]   So it's all government-backed.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.760]   Current yield is about 4.95%,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.400]   is at least today's seven-day yield.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.320]   And that change is coming soon.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.480]   Now, if you have a Fidelity brokerage account,
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.360]   you can already choose SPAXX as your core position.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.140]   In fact, all of the features that this account has
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.560]   are pretty much neck and neck the same,
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.680]   whether it's a brokerage account
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.340]   or a cash management account,
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.960]   with the only difference
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.480]   that if you are using a brokerage account,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.980]   you don't get your ATM fees reimbursed
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.720]   unless you have over $250,000 in the account.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.920]   And even then, you need to go and request
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.700]   that some special flag be added to your account.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.680]   What's the downside here?
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.280]   'Cause this actually seems like it can do everything.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.720]   The starting ATM limits are about $500,
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.580]   but I've read that you can request an increase.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.000]   There is no Zelle access,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.080]   and there are no ability to set up recurring transfers.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.980]   Now, they do have electronic funds transfer,
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.280]   which is effectively an ACH push,
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.520]   which means you can get the routing number,
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.960]   account number, and name of someone
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.220]   and set their account up
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.000]   and be able to send payments to them.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.500]   So if I wanted to pay my au pair every week,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.860]   she could give me all that information
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.320]   and I could send her money every single week.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.600]   However, there is no way to make that recurring.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.280]   Now, that'd be an easy feature to add.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.100]   And if they did,
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.780]   they would check every single box on my list.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.480]   Obviously, they don't have all the features
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.600]   that Mercury created
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.480]   that are a little bit more like business account features
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.800]   for personal accounts.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.080]   But again, those weren't requirements for me.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.120]   But the ability to set up a recurring transfer
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.720]   is really, really important, at least for my use case,
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.780]   because alternatively,
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.880]   it means I need to remember every single week
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.520]   to log into the Fidelity app
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.760]   and spend a couple minutes to send a transfer.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.360]   Layer that on 52 weeks.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.960]   I know I'm gonna forget one week.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.440]   I know I'm gonna pay her late.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.000]   She's gonna be disappointed.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.300]   That's gonna take time.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.000]   And so that is a big downside
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.580]   that I wish there was a way to solve
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.680]   with the Fidelity account.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.820]   One other really cool thing
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.700]   is that that core position has, as I mentioned,
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.040]   about 32% in treasuries,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.520]   which means depending on your state,
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.440]   you might actually get a better after-tax yield
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.920]   because of those US government investments.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.960]   One more thing I like
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.560]   is that you can actually buy other positions
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.880]   in money market funds in your account,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.360]   and Fidelity will sell them
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.840]   in case you need to cover a bill pay, a transfer,
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.400]   maybe made a credit card payment or withdrew money.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.600]   So that's really cool.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.380]   And you can actually put them into things
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.080]   that might have better tax advantage
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.400]   for the state you live in.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.800]   So like I mentioned earlier,
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.040]   some of these US government money market funds
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.480]   that are entirely in treasuries
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.300]   could earn a seven-day yield of a little over 5%.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.620]   But if you factor in what is the equivalent yield
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.800]   of something that doesn't have that tax advantage,
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.600]   it could be closer to 6%.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.120]   And so obviously that depends on what state you live in.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.800]   You can't automatically buy those.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.440]   So when you deposit money into the account,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.680]   it's not gonna automatically buy those other things.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.920]   You can't make them your core position,
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.160]   but they will get liquidated.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.040]   Or you could use them as a savings bucket.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.740]   Let's say you had an emergency fund.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:48.920]   You could say, I'm just gonna use this
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.880]   and buy a different money market fund
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.980]   and kind of segregate it that way.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.640]   Now, a few other small downsides is,
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.360]   one, it doesn't matter to me,
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.760]   but I have seen people talk about
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.000]   how the Fidelity accounts monthly statements
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.440]   are more brokerage statements than checking statements,
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.400]   and they can be hard to read.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.720]   I think you could probably get used to it,
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.360]   but if that's really important to you, it could be an issue.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.560]   And then two, Fidelity is still an old school institution.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.880]   And so I had a few experiences
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.680]   because I recently opened up this account.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.040]   I opened a brokerage and a cash management account.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:19.880]   I set it all up.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.520]   I got it all features working.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.000]   I set up some transfers to see how it worked.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.140]   And it was pretty great.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.900]   But when I had to do a few things,
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.080]   I was just reminded at Fidelity being an old school company.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.000]   So I closed one account.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.560]   I didn't even realize I had.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.920]   And they said, hey, we're gonna mail you
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.840]   a $0 check for this account.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.880]   Obviously, you don't need to do anything with it,
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.800]   but it's just something we have to do.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.060]   And then one time when I did close that account,
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.400]   after the fact, someone said,
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.960]   hey, I did forget to get you verified.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.480]   So they went through an identity verification process
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.200]   after they closed the account,
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.320]   which just seemed like things were a bit more manual
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.560]   and at human discretion.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.380]   Whereas in the Mercury account, everything is online.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.200]   And so everything is protected by two-factor auth
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.080]   and all this stuff, and you're in control.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   Fidelity, I did have to call for a lot of these things.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.020]   And the phone password login situation is so frustrating
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.520]   because they ask you to type in your password
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.240]   using the numbers, like two would be ABC
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.200]   and that kind of thing,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.880]   which is great if you're the kind of person
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.040]   that has the same password for everything.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.840]   But if you have a 20-character string of numbers,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.320]   uppercase, lowercase, and symbols,
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.060]   remembering that is impossible.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.440]   And so you're jumping between one password
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.780]   and your phone to dial in the password.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.240]   And it's so complicated, you end up skipping it.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.720]   And now you have to go through further verification
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.340]   when a rep answers.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.480]   So don't love that.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.600]   Other thing I do love though,
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.620]   is Fidelity is so active on Reddit.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.440]   I would challenge you to find a post
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.600]   in the Fidelity subreddit where people aren't
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.000]   asking questions and someone from Fidelity
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.920]   isn't chiming in with an answer
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.400]   that's really thoughtful and helpful.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.240]   So I love that.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.560]   Also, I'll set up allthehacks.com/fidelity
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.000]   to forward to the Fidelity Cash Management account
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.840]   with any offer I can get from them.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.320]   I'm gonna email and see what happens.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.760]   So check that out.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.400]   So that's a lot of accounts.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.080]   I probably went through at least seven or eight
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.640]   in a lot of detail.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.520]   What is the best bank account?
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   I will give you three answers.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.920]   First, the Wealthfront Cash account.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.400]   Amazing UI/UX.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.840]   Great automation that I'll talk about in a second.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.840]   Consistently high rates.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.760]   All the features you need of a checking account,
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.520]   except that you can't wire money to third parties
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.560]   unless it's for the purpose of buying a home.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.360]   You get no joint access or a joint account
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.120]   and there are no automated recurring transfers.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.040]   So if you're interested in that,
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.120]   I think it's a great option.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.240]   It's paying 5% right now.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.800]   5.5 if you want a referral link.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.480]   If you go to allthehacks.com/wfcash,
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.320]   it's a rotation through all of our member referral links.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.080]   So all of our members will get an extra half a percent.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.840]   You'll get an extra half a percent.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.160]   And obviously if you join the membership,
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.240]   you can add your link to that rotation.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.760]   I know a few members have pointed out
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.000]   that each referral can extend up to a year
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.240]   for three months each.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.440]   So I have a few members who've said
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.320]   they've already bumped up.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.520]   They're earning an extra half a percent for the next year,
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.360]   which is awesome.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.680]   Next is Fidelity.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.880]   Honestly, this account has everything,
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.720]   including some tax advantage and even more tax advantage
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.880]   if you buy other money market funds.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.720]   The only downside is it's an old school user experience
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.000]   and there's none of those automated recurring transfers,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.960]   which might be really nuanced to me
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.800]   and might not matter to you, but worth flagging.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.520]   The other thing that was really nice is
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.120]   there is the ability to go all in on Fidelity.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.000]   So there's this post on Bogleheads
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.080]   called the Fidelity One-Stop Shop,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.780]   where someone points out that you could have
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.760]   the cash management account as your bank account,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.120]   your brokerage account.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   You could do a Fidelity 529.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.720]   You could put all of your Roth IRAs.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.700]   You could do your solo 401k, your HSA.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.540]   And you could even,
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.540]   if you wanted to use the Fidelity credit card,
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.360]   which is 2% cash back on everything.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.080]   So you could use Fidelity as your simple one-stop shop
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.960]   for absolutely everything financial.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.760]   And I think if that's important to you,
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.900]   I couldn't imagine a better solution.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.560]   And then the last is Mercury.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.480]   If the idea of having some of these business-like features
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.720]   in your account would simplify your life,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   being able to send wires on demand online,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.760]   being able to spin up multiple accounts
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.000]   and multiple cards for other people.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.560]   I even found that when I was looking
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.880]   at a service called Greenlight,
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.040]   which would allow you to set up a debit card for your kids,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.800]   that Mercury actually would let me create a login,
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.980]   create a separate checking and savings account
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.860]   for my daughter.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.560]   It would all be legally in my name
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.120]   and I could get her a debit card and send it to her.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.500]   And so she could operate out of it.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.300]   I could transfer money in and out of it.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.900]   I could set limits and rules
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.800]   on how she spends on her debit card.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.080]   So effectively, I could get all of the features
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.620]   of opening up a Greenlight account.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.560]   Maybe not all of them.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.280]   I haven't looked in too much nuance
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.020]   at the details and the features of Greenlight.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.960]   She'd earn 5% on her savings account though.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.080]   So that's cool.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.280]   And I wouldn't have to pay an annual fee for Greenlight.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.320]   So there are some features
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.720]   that might even make it more compelling
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.960]   and worth that $240 annual fee.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   And if they can add joint accounts,
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.160]   which is on the list, they've committed to do it.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.680]   And if they add that treasury feature,
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.880]   which would let you put money into a fund
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.820]   that hopefully has some tax advantage,
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.480]   I think it would be a really, really compelling alternative
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.920]   to the Fidelity account.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.160]   So is it worth it?
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.920]   Really depends on your circumstance.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.760]   I don't have any invites, but I have asked for them.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.960]   And if I get them, I'll put them up
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.400]   at allthehacks.com/mercury.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.920]   So I hope all that was helpful.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.160]   Now, if you're wondering whether it's really worth switching,
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.320]   I guess it depends a little bit on how much cash you have.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.560]   But I would say the average person listening
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.960]   to this episode who's using an account at a regular bank
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.320]   is probably missing out on at least $1,000 a year
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.080]   of interest by using the wrong bank account.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.960]   If you keep $25,000 in your checking account,
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.940]   missing out on 5% is about $1,250 a year.
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.520]   Now, keep in mind that this interest is taxed,
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.920]   unlike credit card points or cash back.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.580]   So that might take you below the $1,000 threshold.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.920]   Now, maybe $1,000 isn't important to you.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.480]   Maybe it's super meaningful.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.280]   I have a feeling that if it's not important,
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.340]   you probably also keep a lot more money in checking account.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.000]   So maybe that number will be a lot higher for you.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.340]   If you do have 50, $100,000,
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.580]   or maybe you're even saving for a down payment,
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.040]   or you're making regular tuition payments,
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.240]   missing out on 5% is gonna be thousands of dollars a year.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.840]   And even if the alternative isn't zero,
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.880]   but it's 0.48% like you're getting at Schwab,
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.880]   or 0.25% like you're getting at the Ally checking account,
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.000]   it's still close to $1,000 a year.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.920]   So to me, that's worth it,
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.640]   especially when some of these products
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.920]   are such a better experience.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.800]   Last, before I talk about automation,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.080]   I wanna talk about a few reasons
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.560]   you might not wanna do this.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.840]   First, if you get a mortgage discount
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.040]   by keeping your checking account
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.760]   at that financial institution,
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.800]   then moving to another one
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.920]   might cost you a lot more in mortgage interest
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.100]   than you'll earn in interest on your account.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.640]   Now, you could automate this
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.720]   and use an account that regularly
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.840]   just moves the amount for your mortgage payment
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.660]   into that account and leaves it there.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.680]   Or you could send a message to your bank and say,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.720]   "Hey, can I move which account I pay my mortgage out of?"
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.080]   And if that works, great.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.680]   Or if you have a bank that has really cool features
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.460]   that make it worth being there even for less interest,
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.200]   that could make sense.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.880]   All the Hacks member Andy mentioned
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.080]   that his bank will actually adjust down his interest rate
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.120]   if mortgage rates drop
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.440]   for just a couple hundred or thousand dollars,
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.880]   which is really compelling
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.360]   if you're someone who currently is sitting
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.200]   on a 7% interest rate
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.320]   and wants to be able to lower that in the future.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.880]   So I can't speak to all the situations.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.680]   Those are a couple that came to mind.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.200]   But the last thing I wanna cover
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.520]   is automating your entire financial life.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.840]   And it's something I actually wanted
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.480]   to do an entire episode on,
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.120]   but I realized with just a few simple moves,
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   you can automate your entire financial life
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.640]   from saving to investing.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.360]   So I don't think we need to spend an hour talking about it.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.560]   And I want is to end you up in a place
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.800]   where you don't have to think about money
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.720]   on a regular basis,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.200]   and you can have the peace of mind
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.880]   that everything you want is happening in the background.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.960]   So here's the way I do it.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.800]   First, I set all bills up on autopay.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.000]   That doesn't mean you don't have to review
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:07.960]   your credit card bills.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.220]   It just means you don't review them
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.200]   and manually make the payments.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.560]   So all of them are getting auto paid
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.880]   out of my primary account,
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.000]   the account that's earning interest.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.440]   For a couple of bills like our property tax bill
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.340]   that aren't automated,
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.900]   I just set up a calendar reminder so I don't forget,
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.540]   and I pay it out of the same account.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.400]   So all the bills are getting paid automatically.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.880]   Because the cash is earning interest,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.120]   I don't have to worry about moving money around at all.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.560]   So what if you don't want everything in cash?
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.440]   What about investing?
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.160]   So there are a few ways to automate this.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.540]   So assuming you have a brokerage account somewhere,
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.740]   one way is through your payroll provider,
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.480]   you can actually split your direct deposit.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.720]   So you could say, if I get $1,000 per pay period,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.760]   I could put 800 in checking and 200 in my brokerage account.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.140]   If your brokerage account supports that, that's an option.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.700]   If not, you could just set up a recurring transfer,
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.560]   say every month, I wanna move $500 from my savings account
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.860]   into my investment account.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.040]   Now, unfortunately,
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.440]   unless you're using an automated investment platform
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.980]   like Wealthfront or Betterment,
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.160]   where the money deposited gets automatically invested,
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.500]   then once that money's there,
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.920]   you do actually have to think about it.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.880]   You have to log in and you have to go in
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.620]   and buy and sell securities,
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.280]   which is more work than I wanna have to think about.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.040]   That's why I love the Wealthfront product,
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.080]   because I could just send money into the account
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.760]   and it's automatically invested.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.920]   Now, full disclosure, I worked at Wealthfront.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.760]   I do hold some stock in the company,
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.380]   but I also use them for my investing.
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.000]   The other way to do this is to use a feature
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.820]   that I helped build at Wealthfront.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.580]   When we built it, it was called Autopilot.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.400]   I think it's called Automated Savings now.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.760]   And the way it works is you can monitor a cash account
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.780]   or a checking account,
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.080]   and it doesn't even have to be at Wealthfront.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.020]   And say, anytime there is more than X number of dollars
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.660]   in that account, I want you to take that money
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.040]   and go through this process.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.200]   And you create an automated savings plan.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.680]   And what it will do is you can go in and say,
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.580]   first, I want you to fill my cash account
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.000]   with $20,000 of an emergency fund.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.020]   And then once that's full,
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.920]   then I want you to put up to the annual limit
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.480]   into my Roth IRA.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.420]   After that, I want you to put up to,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.040]   let's call it $5,000 in my children's 529.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.080]   And after that, invest in my taxable brokerage account.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.360]   And you can edit your plan anytime you want.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.000]   And it just sweeps money from your checking
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.580]   or cash account into all of those places.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.100]   So I'm really proud of that product.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.420]   I think it does exactly what I would want to do
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.580]   to automate my finances.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.040]   And since a lot of my accounts are at Wealthfront,
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.360]   I can use it in that way.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.080]   But if you aren't using Wealthfront
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.200]   for your brokerage account,
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.800]   you can set up recurring transfers
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.320]   and automate that as well.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.500]   You just have to remember to regularly log in
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.320]   and actually buy the securities
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.680]   so you're not leaving cash in your brokerage account.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.320]   So I hope this episode helps you save a ton of time
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.160]   and energy.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.080]   And for everyone,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.820]   I hope it helps you earn a lot more interest in your cash
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.780]   and helps you find a great bank account
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.440]   that you can use to operate your life out of.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.780]   Couple of quick reminders,

[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.980]   I can't promise that there will be anything there,
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.600]   but I'm going to try my best.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.200]   And finally, allthehacks.com/bankbonus.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.760]   We set up a page here
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.240]   that showcases all of the different bonuses

[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:23.560]   whether it's for the bonus
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.020]   or just because you want an account,
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.400]   definitely check that page

[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.720]   I will put it there.
