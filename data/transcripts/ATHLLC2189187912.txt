[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.160]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.800]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.880]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.200]   and today we're gonna run through all the different ways
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.840]   that you can save money when booking flights.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.640]   Now, I think we might skip a few of the basics,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.920]   like checking nearby airports or looking at different dates,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.620]   but we are going to cover everything else.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.760]   That includes points,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.680]   including a rundown of our favorite tools
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.080]   to search for availability,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.800]   hidden city ticketing, VPN arbitrage,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160]   consolidator fares, buddy passes, and so much more,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.180]   including a peek behind the scenes
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.800]   of the secret world of buying and selling points and miles.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.960]   And here to join me for this conversation is Zach Resnick,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.200]   who is an absolute expert at finding the best flight deals.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000]   He's the founder of FlyFlat,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.920]   an amazing site focused on finding
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.760]   discount premium cabin flights.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   I am pretty sure that most of you
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.120]   will end up saving money from this episode,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.160]   and if so, please reach out and let me know how much.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.320]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.380]   When it comes to managing my money,
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.120]   there is one app I check almost every day,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.440]   and it's Copilot, our sponsor today.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.080]   It's one of my all-time favorite apps.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.400]   It's on my home screen,
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   and it makes it so seamless and easy
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.460]   to track your spending
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.560]   and manage your entire financial picture.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.640]   And just this week, they launched an importer
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.400]   for all your old mint data,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   which is amazing because I just imported 9,917 transactions
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.120]   dating back to 2012, which means I now have over a decade
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.920]   of all of my financial data in one place.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.560]   Now, I've tried so many apps for tracking spending.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.680]   Last year, I evaluated over a dozen of them,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.520]   but Copilot is the only one I've kept using.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.640]   You can link your accounts at over 10,000 institutions,
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.760]   and their expense categorization is the best I've used
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.040]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440]   that make it even better.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.940]   You can completely design your spending categories
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.280]   and subcategories and easily set up rules
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.080]   to assign transactions to them automatically.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.480]   Thanks to Copilot, I've never had a better grasp
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.160]   on our spending and cashflow,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.640]   which I'm pretty sure has resulted
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   in thousands of dollars of savings every year.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.560]   So for the best app to track your spending,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.400]   subscriptions, and investments,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.820]   go to allthehacks.com/copilot on an iPhone or Mac
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.320]   to download Copilot and enter code HACKS2
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.000]   during onboarding for a two-month free trial.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.600]   and the code HACKS2 for a free two-month trial
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.740]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.440]   Zach, thanks for being here.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.280]   - My pleasure.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.080]   Thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.200]   - So I'm just gonna kick us off,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.560]   and I wanna know what you think most people do wrong
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.880]   when they start looking for flight deals.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.640]   - There's so much to choose from here,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.680]   and I think it all starts with
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.480]   what are you trying to optimize for?
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.880]   This is a question that I'm sure you think about a lot
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   in all different domains,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   not just travel or booking flights,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.660]   but I'm sure a lot of your listeners can relate to
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.420]   perhaps in their job, whether they're paid an hourly rate
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.840]   or effectively have an hourly rate
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.800]   based on their salary is X,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   and they look back on looking at the flight part
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.680]   of their trip and found that they effectively
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.280]   paid themselves 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 X
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.040]   to try to save 50 bucks, 100 bucks,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   even a few hundred dollars on a flight
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.960]   by just putting a lot of time into it.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.280]   So I think that's a really big mistake
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.080]   a lot of people make, which is like, okay,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.240]   if I'm gonna really hunt for a good deal,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.700]   how much more time is that gonna take
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.560]   and what's really my best outcome here?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.200]   So deal hunting, for example, on family of four
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.360]   flying business to Europe, if you're in the States,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.720]   is very different than like, okay,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.120]   I wanna go to Chicago if you're an SF in economy,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.920]   let me play around for 1/2 an hour
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.160]   to try to find the best deal.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.280]   So I think a big thing you just wanna ask yourself
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.920]   is okay, how much is my time really worth here
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.000]   and what am I hoping to accomplish?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.080]   But yeah, I can go on and on
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.320]   with the mistakes that people make.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.480]   I think another one is using online travel agencies,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.240]   which just rarely makes sense
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.480]   unless you're booking pretty last minute
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.040]   because if you ever wanna do a change or cancellation,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   it's just a horrible experience.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   It's somewhere between impossible and agonizing.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.480]   So there's really, no matter how high end you're going,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   if you can't afford a $7,000 business class ticket,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.040]   it's not worth it to save $400
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.180]   because you have to then change it, it's terrible.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.480]   And if you're flying economy for 120 bucks
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.120]   and the OTA can give it to you for $98,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.320]   probably not worth the $22 that you've saved.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.680]   Like at any price point,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.920]   I don't think the math really makes sense there.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   And then I think a lot of people
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.880]   just have habits and loyalties that just don't make sense.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.000]   Like the amount of people that I know that are really savvy
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   in other parts of their purchasing lives
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.560]   and they are Delta loyalists
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.360]   and they'll literally search on delta.com
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.040]   is just mind boggling.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.840]   - Okay, so it sounds like this is perfect
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.040]   to tease us up for the conversation,
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.460]   which is people are just optimizing for the wrong thing
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.060]   and they're spending too long to optimize.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.920]   So what I thought would be great,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.300]   and we've talked about this in advance,
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.900]   is what if we just go through everything you need to do
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.100]   and we'll include some of the ones
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.580]   that maybe aren't worth your time,
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   but to save money on a flight.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.020]   And just to be clear for people listening,
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.140]   this is not a miles and points only conversation.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.620]   This is, if you need to buy an airline ticket,
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.680]   how do you find a price?
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.060]   What are all the considerations
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.820]   to try to get that price down?
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.740]   And to your earlier point
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.540]   about people spending too much time,
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.340]   hopefully we can leave every single person here
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.980]   with at least one or two tactics
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.980]   that they could use quickly to save money on a future trip.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.300]   Maybe all future trips and maybe a lot of money
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.420]   and maybe a lot of tactics,
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.700]   but at least one tactic to save some money on one trip
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.060]   is what I want everyone to have.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.500]   And if you're listening and you end up saving
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.400]   a boatload of money on any trip,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.380]   first off, new website for all the hacks
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.260]   has our iTunes reviews cycling.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.300]   So leave a review about how much you saved
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.540]   and you'll probably see it on the website,
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.940]   but also reach out, let us know.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.020]   I love to hear these stories of how much people have saved.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.140]   So to kick us off, let's talk and we can go back and forth,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.820]   but where do you even just start to search for flights?
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.260]   Like first thing you're doing.
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.620]   - Yeah, so for myself personally
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.260]   and within my travel business,
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.660]   which we'll get to a little bit later,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.040]   Google Flights is actually almost always
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.260]   the first place that we start.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.220]   It's a really incredible tool.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.020]   The user experience is fantastic.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.100]   It's very clean.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.220]   It shows you what you need to see very quickly.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.140]   And most importantly, like an Expedia or a Kayak
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.360]   or really any other flight aggregator,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.460]   when Google is showing you their best flight,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.020]   which is if you ever use Google Flights,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.900]   you usually will see best flight, best flights,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.100]   one, two, or three flights that come to the top.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.500]   Those are not gonna be influenced
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.380]   by the commissions that Google makes,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.940]   where if you look at the kind of competitor sites,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.660]   you'll see that the order,
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.540]   whether it's the top flights or in the middle,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.180]   is like all very influenced
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.500]   by the actual amount of money they make on tickets,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.100]   which kind of gets to something
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.500]   probably most of your listeners are familiar with,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.880]   which is if you're not paying for the product,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.380]   like you are the product,
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.820]   then almost every travel business,
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.580]   especially in the airline industry,
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.180]   makes money by either selling your data
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.660]   to a bigger travel business or to a company like Google
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.300]   or by begging airlines for commissions.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.860]   And then you're kind of the vehicle to get that commission.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.140]   - I'm not paying for Google Flights,
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.280]   so in some way I must be the product.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.620]   But why is that different?
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.100]   - Google is basically just at a scale
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.660]   where they can decide to not make margin there
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.940]   because they're just printing money through their business,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.780]   where for Expedia, that's like the entirety of their business
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.260]   or a big part of their business,
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.380]   such that they can't afford to leave that money on the table
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.660]   where Google does things all the time.
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.820]   Like, I mean, Google Maps,
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.780]   there's very few ways they directly monetize Google Maps,
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.380]   but just by getting you into the ecosystem
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.540]   and giving you a great experience,
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.620]   it has a lot of benefit to them.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.640]   - And do you trust when you're on Google Flights
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.460]   or other sites, if people are on them,
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.560]   when they kind of give these predictions
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.780]   of where the fare is going up or down?
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.940]   And I remember Google doing this,
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.700]   but now that I think about it, I'm like,
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.420]   I don't know if they do it all the time,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.440]   but are those predictions good?
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.540]   Do you trust them?
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.660]   - So I'm not a great person to ask here
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.900]   because I know that my
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.420]   and my team members' predictions are way better.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.020]   So I've never taken the time
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.500]   to actually systematically look through
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.820]   what Google has to say.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.780]   I can tell you for sure that when I looked into Hopper,
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.460]   the predictions were really off two or three years ago.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.860]   But yeah, I just haven't spent the time
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.700]   to look at Google Flights
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.380]   to have a strong opinion about that.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.260]   But what I would say in general
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.420]   is that if you're relying on
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.620]   automatically generated predictions to book a flight,
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.660]   you're probably optimizing for the wrong thing.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.380]   - And obviously, you guys have booked,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.940]   I don't know, thousands, hundreds of thousands of flights.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.300]   You know more about this than I do.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.140]   And in some ways,
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.540]   I'm going through this entire conversation.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.940]   I'm like, ooh, I wanna make sure I'm doing,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.900]   like if I can leave doing all the things you do,
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.660]   I'm gonna feel really stoked.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.860]   But you said you have a really good calibration
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.940]   on whether the fare might go up or down.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.980]   Obviously, some of that's destination specific.
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.300]   Like you probably know what the fare will probably be
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.580]   and we can't go through every city,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.540]   but are there any timeline things that go through your head
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.380]   in terms of like days out or stuff like that
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.780]   that is kind of a good barometer for when you should book?
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.780]   - The short answer is it really just depends
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.940]   on a lot of things.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.500]   And this happens all the time in my business
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.780]   where clients are like, well,
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.420]   when is the best time to book for this route
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.020]   that I actually want right now?
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.540]   Or when generally is the best time?
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.100]   And I can't really give an answer.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.860]   If you give me a specific route,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.660]   then I could potentially give much higher probabilities.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.900]   But again, we're thinking in probabilities here.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.580]   So you have to be okay with that uncertainty.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.140]   So there's never something where it's like
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.860]   100% of the time, this is how it's gonna happen.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.260]   So is you want like a 70%, an 80%
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.820]   and then you kind of have an edge there.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.540]   But for a lot of people with travel,
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.500]   just emotionally, the idea of waiting
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.100]   because you wanted to save money
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.340]   and then spending more money
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.180]   is just feel so much worse than spending the money today
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.020]   that they don't do it.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.020]   So that's just another example of how in today,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.620]   you always get paid for kind of accepting volatility.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.860]   And with flights and travel, it's no different.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.740]   - Sometimes the smallest changes
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.300]   make the biggest impact
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.540]   and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.100]   to your morning routine.

[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.140]   but they make amazing coffee

[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.220]   I've talked to a lot of amazing people on this podcast,
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.580]   but if you're like me, you wanna go deeper.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.980]   So where can you go to learn
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.720]   from the most remarkable people?

[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.560]   This year, don't just talk about improving.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.840]   Masterclass helps you actually do it
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.580]   by giving you unlimited access

[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.120]   So whether you wanna master negotiation with Chris Voss,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.240]   think like a boss with Martha Stewart,
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   or go deeper on mental strength
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.680]   with allthehacks guest Robin Arzon,

[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.260]   which helped me be more confident in the kitchen
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.620]   and introduce some new flavors to our weekly meals.

[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.580]   So you mentioned the travel portals briefly earlier.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.920]   There's two thoughts that I have.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.780]   I heard why you don't like them,
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.660]   but I'll say one, capital one, in their travel portal,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.220]   and especially for anyone who has a VentureX card
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.740]   where they actually have $300 they have to spend,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.660]   where I think maybe that would be a scenario
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.560]   that you could argue if you have a $300 fight
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.900]   and you can get it for free in the portal,
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.500]   it might be worth the hassle that could come with it,
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.100]   but they will, within 10 days,
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.060]   if your flight drops in price and they recommended buy it,
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.940]   they'll refund you up to $50.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.660]   Now, we could talk about whether the hassle
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.220]   of doing all this is worth the $50,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.540]   but I will at least say
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.620]   that if you're in the capital one travel portal,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.580]   it is kind of cool
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.820]   that they believe in their algorithm enough
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.680]   to back it by $50 in 10 days.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.720]   So not great if you've got a family of four
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.200]   taking an international vacation
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.460]   where the $50 is probably not worth it,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.960]   but something to keep in mind.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.260]   And then I sent you before we recorded,
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.060]   'cause I knew your perspective on travel portals,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.640]   an article that I'll link to in the show notes
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.500]   where the points guy went through all these travel portals,
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.820]   and for the most part,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.640]   the travel portals were about the same price.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.020]   Sometimes they were a little cheaper,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.700]   and then there were a couple routes
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.660]   where they were like half the price or 30% off,
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.540]   and then a bunch of routes
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.460]   where they were twice as expensive.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.060]   I get the consideration
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.140]   about why you don't wanna book a travel portal,
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.980]   why you don't wanna be stuck with the hassle.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.220]   I'll share one anecdote from my side was,
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.640]   we were flying to Cabo,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.980]   and half of the group had booked an Alaska flight
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.820]   on their own,
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.460]   and half had booked through some travel portal.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.980]   One person through Amex, maybe one through kayak,
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.500]   and the flight was four hours delayed.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.340]   And they were like,
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.540]   "We're waiting for the inbound aircraft to leave LA."
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.860]   And everyone's like, "I don't know, maybe it doesn't leave.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.940]   Who knows what's happening?"
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.520]   And United, funny, going back to your point
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.260]   about who knows what's happening with fares,
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.340]   the flight to Cabo on United
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.900]   was the exact same price one hour before departure.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.860]   So we were like, "Let's cancel our Alaska flight.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.260]   Let's go get the United flight.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.740]   Airplane's already here, it leaves in an hour."
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.580]   For me, booked directly on Alaska,
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.480]   went to the counter, said,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.700]   "Hey, your flight's delayed four hours.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.540]   Can you cancel it?"
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.360]   "No problem."
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.280]   Unchecked me in, canceled it, full refund.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.460]   I remember sitting on the United plane
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.500]   next to a friend of mine
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.420]   who's on the phone with Amex Travel,
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.220]   and is trying to get his flight on Alaska canceled
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.820]   before the doors close.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.460]   And I actually don't know whether it happened,
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.160]   because I think he had to hang up
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.260]   and just hope that they were able to cancel it
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.140]   while we were in the air,
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.260]   and I don't think I followed up.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.380]   But we all know that changing things is a hassle.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.980]   If you get $300 free, it might be worth it.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.020]   But is there any scenario where it's worth it
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.900]   for, I don't know, the 10X points
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.900]   some of these credit cards
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.500]   will give you to book in their portal?
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.980]   - Yeah, what I would say is,
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.580]   if you're gonna listen to this entire episode,
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.460]   the answer is almost certainly not.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.100]   I think there's some people
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.220]   that it does make sense to use the portal,
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.860]   and that's kind of the most advanced way
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.600]   they're going to be able to get good deals,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.980]   maybe that and using a certain credit card
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.540]   of the issuing bank that has the portal.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.100]   Like, for example, using the Chase Sapphire Reserves
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.420]   to book travel within the Chase Travel Portal.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.420]   That, for a lot of flights,
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.060]   is gonna be better than using Google Flights.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.180]   But there's so many other things out there that you can do,
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.140]   and if you're the type of person
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.700]   that's regularly listening to all the hacks
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.060]   that you're finding this episode,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.500]   or I'm sending you to this episode,
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.540]   there's probably much lower-hanging fruit
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.340]   that takes less time that has a better reward.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.420]   So what I would say is, yes, those use cases exist,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.140]   but it's kind of similar to using an OTA,
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.060]   which is like, okay, who's the person
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:37.060]   for whom saving $100 on a $800 flight makes sense
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.900]   that has such low probability of changing,
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.180]   of needing to change the ticket,
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.220]   and then if they do, being okay with that happening?
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.300]   It's like, those people exist,
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.820]   but it feels like it's a pretty small percentage
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.300]   of people that are gonna wanna make that trade
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   and feel good about it.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.580]   A lot of people make these trades
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.860]   because it feels really good in the moment
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.300]   to save 20 bucks, save 50 bucks, save 100 bucks,
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.620]   and then you regret it, what feels like forever
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.300]   when the inevitable thing happens,
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.620]   because there's just always delays,
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.580]   always cancellations, no matter how well you plan.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.260]   I don't think it makes a ton of sense to look into them,
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.340]   and frankly, Chris, you've probably looked
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.940]   at these portals more than I have,
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.740]   and I think by the time we're finished here
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.180]   in discussing all the different ways
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.620]   you can save money on travel,
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.700]   if you're actually going through
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.300]   the kind of waterfall approach
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.260]   that I used to take personally,
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.780]   that I built a business around,
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.340]   going through the portal at the end,
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.380]   probably not gonna make sense
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.500]   because you're gonna find something that's higher leverage.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.180]   - Great, so let's go through this list,
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.100]   and I'll flag that you said the waterfall approach.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.820]   I don't know if this list is gonna be the perfect order
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.900]   because there's probably gonna be scenarios
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.260]   where some do work, some don't work.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.060]   So listen to the whole thing
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.100]   and think about all that first,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.380]   but where do you think the biggest opportunity
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.380]   for arbitraging the price of a flight is?
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.580]   - Yeah, and just before I answer that question directly,
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.980]   like when I say waterfall,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.700]   what I mean is starting with the thing
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.020]   that has the highest probability
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.980]   of getting you a much more discounted flight,
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.380]   and then going to the next thing,
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.220]   the next thing, the next thing
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.340]   before you just kind of give up
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.100]   and book it like a retail price.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.940]   And what that is for a business
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.460]   versus a certain type of frequent traveler
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.540]   versus infrequent traveler,
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.100]   that's gonna be different every time.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.820]   So just giving that caveat,
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.620]   but for almost everyone in most use cases,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.460]   trying to see if you can use miles and points
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.020]   is going to make sense as a first step.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.700]   And the more savvy you are,
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.980]   the more you'll be able to understand very quickly
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.580]   if it's the type of route or flight
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.140]   where you don't need to even bother looking at it.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.940]   The more you travel business in first class,
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.300]   and the more you travel more flexibly,
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.660]   one ways versus round trip and last minute,
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.900]   the more miles and points make sense.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.660]   And the less you do those things,
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.780]   the lower the probability
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.540]   you're gonna be able to get a good mileage deal.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.940]   The point where for some itineraries,
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.780]   where if you're like,
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.740]   hey Zach, like me and my entire family
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.940]   wanna go to Europe next summer
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.900]   and leave the Friday or Saturday
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.220]   after public school ends in the Bay Area
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.260]   and come back nine days later on the Sunday,
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.340]   I can tell you don't bother looking for miles
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.380]   for four or five tickets
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.460]   because that probability is basically approaching zero.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.300]   But if you tell me,
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.460]   hey, tomorrow I wanna take a business class flight
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.060]   to any metropolitan city in Europe and get a great deal,
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.300]   I can say with basically 100% confidence,
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.180]   you will be able to find a great deal with miles.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.060]   And then everything else is kind of in between.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.380]   - And that flexibility, by the way,
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.820]   I wrote this list for this presentation I just gave.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.460]   It's not just flexible with dates,
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.060]   it could be flexible with city,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.580]   it could be flexible with how many layovers you have,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.820]   it could be flexible with what season you go,
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.980]   it could be flexible with if you're a family
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.340]   of two parents and two kids,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.420]   do you and your spouse fly separately each with one kid
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.860]   because you found two tickets on two different airlines?
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.700]   And I have not done that yet.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.540]   We got lucky.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.980]   Just to give a great example,
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.260]   two Christmases ago,
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.600]   we wanted to go for the holidays to Paris and London.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.460]   And we decided a couple of weeks before, great, right?
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.660]   We weren't as flexible, but it was last minute.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.260]   And we found four tickets, nonstop San Francisco to Paris
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.580]   and then return London back to San Francisco.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.180]   The outbound was 60,000 points each
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.100]   and the return was through Turkish,
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.980]   which has a great deal for 45,000.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.020]   So it was 105,000 points a person round trip in business.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.980]   Awesome deal.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.140]   And that was for four people, two weeks before the holidays,
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.400]   which is actually, I think a great time to travel
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.740]   because everyone's traveling two weeks later.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.020]   So obviously if you have the flexibility, a good option.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.100]   Okay, so let's talk about that middle ground
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.540]   or even the ground where you're like, I am flexible.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.060]   We're gonna do a whole episode,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.380]   deep diving on all the tools you can use.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.680]   We've talked about them a lot.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.480]   And I realized there's just not a canonical place
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.740]   for me to send people that are like,
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.580]   what are the best tools?
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.220]   So I'm gonna make that episode.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.620]   But I wanna hear from you,
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.180]   what are the tools that you like
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.980]   because you do this for a living and I do this for sport?
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.340]   To be honest, only for a couple of years now
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.660]   have I not booked my own travel.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.260]   Even when I've had a very capable team
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.000]   that's doing this for other people,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.460]   I still always wanna do it myself.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.940]   And I still actually like look up travel for myself,
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.060]   even though I don't really book it for myself anymore.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.500]   So full disclosure here, what I'm gonna share
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.100]   is based on the experience of my team using these tools
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.420]   as well as some friends.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.820]   And whenever possible, unless you really love doing this,
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.780]   I'm obviously a little biased here,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.060]   but I think outsourcing it to professionals
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.500]   when it makes economic sense can be a good idea
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.580]   because it's really like,
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.260]   I've spent literally over 10,000 hours
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.100]   optimizing this stuff for myself.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.420]   And that's not an investment
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.380]   that makes sense for everyone to do.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.140]   Although I'm very happy that I personally made it.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.460]   So to the tools.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.900]   So seats.arrow is a tool you've talked about
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.220]   on your podcast before, Chris.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.700]   It's really like kind of taken the miles
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.120]   and points industry by storm.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.260]   It's a really incredible scraper
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.660]   that just gives you a bunch of information
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.020]   about basically every possible way you can use points
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.940]   and makes it pretty easily searchable.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.780]   And the functionality in the free version
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.780]   is really, really good.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.780]   So this is something that for my team
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.060]   where we've built some of our own internal software
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.380]   to help more efficiently search for great mileage deals,
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.220]   my team still uses seats.arrow as well
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.940]   to supplement that software.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.340]   And it's the only external tool that we use regularly today.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.260]   So I think that alone should kind of say,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.740]   you know, the functionality of it and how powerful it is.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.020]   That being said, if you don't already know a lot
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.020]   about miles and points and are listening to this,
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.140]   seats.arrow will feel really overwhelming
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.140]   and like there'll be a big learning curve.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.820]   So unless you're already someone
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.660]   who thinks of themselves as savvy with seats.arrow,
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.540]   and you don't wanna make a big investment,
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.980]   I would not even bother diving more into this.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.900]   I'd say that one kind of person it could make sense for
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.940]   is if you're like an engineer,
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.820]   you're already a pretty technical person,
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.700]   and you wanna learn a lot more about travel
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.260]   and have like a fun new tool
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.140]   to kind of co-teach yourself with,
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.980]   seats.arrow is gonna be a great tool for that.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.140]   So Chris, I don't know if you wanna talk
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.260]   about your experience using it
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.300]   or your friends or colleagues,
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.220]   but it's really powerful
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.900]   and everyone I know in the miles and points industry,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.660]   it's like once they heard about it,
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.380]   it became kind of the tool of choice
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.300]   or one of the tools of choices pretty quickly.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.700]   - It's a fantastic tool.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.740]   Ian, the guy who started it is also awesome
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.860]   because when he gets a cease and desist from an airline,
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.020]   he fights it, he doesn't just roll over.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.580]   This is his project and he's put a lot of work into it.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.820]   It is great for very, very, very flexible things
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.940]   like North America to Europe and that kind of stuff.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.740]   The one thing it misses is
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.220]   if you have ultimate flexibility,
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.340]   seats.arrow is really good
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.860]   if you wanna search within a month,
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.420]   you can do like plus 28 day searches across all programs.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.980]   They basically have two sections,
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.580]   one where you search by a program
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.580]   and one where you search across everything.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.900]   I don't think there is an easy way to do like,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.340]   wanna go to Japan next year across all programs.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.060]   I think like that is one area that's missing.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.740]   And so the tool I've been using a lot for that is points.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.780]   Yeah, there are a lot of these tools,
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.100]   but because they have a really good flexible search
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   that's like, I just wanna go somewhere
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.820]   like show me what's possible.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.620]   And it's a lot easier of an interface
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.720]   for somebody to get started.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.360]   There's a free version that also is great
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.080]   and the paid version is not that expensive.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.620]   If I can get deals for any of these tools,
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.080]   I'll link to all of them in the show notes.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.320]   I think some of them we have on our deals page,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.100]   but I'm gonna go try just since we're talking about them.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.940]   I don't wanna go too far down this rabbit hole.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.520]   Are there any other tools
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.820]   that you think are worth calling out?
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.140]   - Yeah, I just wanna note, again,
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.620]   the kind of the use case if you're listening this,
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.020]   like, should I take the time to look at points?
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.420]   Yeah, I think points, yeah,
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.620]   is great really for all spectrums.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.740]   If you're a beginner,
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.660]   it's actually like a pretty intuitive tool to use.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.460]   The other tool I would just mention
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.300]   for less flexible travel,
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.900]   but that still wants to use miles and points,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.060]   award logic.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.780]   So if you're like, hey, listen,
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.820]   I wanna travel from here to there
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.980]   in a one or two, maybe three day period,
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.140]   and I wanna search across programs.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.200]   Today, I think the most user-friendly tool
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.740]   is by far award logic.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.720]   So I'd also just highlight that tool as well.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.680]   My gripe with award logic is that
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.100]   it's more expensive than most tools.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.520]   It's like 20 bucks a month,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.200]   which if you're doing this for a living, makes sense.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.840]   If you're doing for sport, might seem like a lot.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.600]   Obviously, if you're gonna book one flight
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.720]   or if you're booking a big trip
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.200]   to pay for a tool for a month is fine.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.760]   I also pay for point.me.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.440]   It's much slower than award logic
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.680]   and you can only search one date at a time,
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.040]   but I sometimes recommend it more to people
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.060]   who want more handholding
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.080]   because I think the instruction at point.me
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   is hands down the best.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.000]   If you're new to this and you're like, I need help,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.680]   point.me is one where they're like,
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.720]   here is the place to go to the website to search.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.280]   Here is how to open the account.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.600]   Here is how to log into your Capital One account
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.960]   and here's how to transfer.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.440]   They walk you through every single step.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.080]   So I think if you're new to this
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.600]   and you're looking for very specific dates,
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.000]   award logic is faster
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.160]   and lets you search three days at a time.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.000]   Point.me is slower and lets you search one day at a time,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.760]   but will really handhold you through the entire process
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.380]   to the point that like,
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.280]   maybe you use one tool and find your flight
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.600]   and then you pay for the day pass for like $5 on point.me
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.020]   to just like pull it up and have them walk you through it.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.160]   So stay tuned for all of the other tool overviews
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.320]   we're gonna give.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.400]   - One note on point.me as well,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.680]   which is if you have a lot of miles and points,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.840]   but you don't wanna be bothered to do this,
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.680]   point.me also has a service
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.880]   and a lot of these other sites do as well.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.800]   I think award logic does too,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.160]   where you can pay them 200 bucks, 150 bucks
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.120]   for them to help you use your own miles and points.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.760]   - The point.me concierge is great.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.680]   I've sent a lot of people there.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.000]   They've had really good experiences.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.120]   I think we have a discount
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.760]   that I'm gonna link to in the show notes
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.680]   in case you wanna use it.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.080]   There's a couple other ones out there.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.600]   One called award cat, 10X travel has one.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.160]   You said award logic might have one too.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.920]   So it's $150 per person, maybe $200 per person,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.160]   but you only pay if they find something.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.480]   Usually it's a 25 to $50 search fee.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.960]   So you've gotta ask yourself, how big of a trip is this?
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.040]   How many points do I have?
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.480]   How am I gonna make this whole thing work?
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.760]   And is it worth my time to go figure this out?
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.440]   For a lot of people listening, it's fun.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   They wanna do that.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.600]   Some people, they don't.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.880]   And those tools are really great.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.000]   But I think there's another place that is interesting,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.440]   which is if this is the biggest arbitrage, right?
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.320]   If you're taking a family of four
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.040]   to Europe in business class, like we were on our trip,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.120]   400,000 points is depending on where you got them
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.360]   and how you acquired them,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.920]   could be valued as low as like four grand.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.560]   And I can tell you that that flight was probably,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.840]   I think it was like 4,000, 5,000 each,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.360]   if not more last minute in December.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.200]   So that's a huge arbitrage, right?
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.360]   Like it was probably $20,000 of flights
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.840]   for the equivalent of $4,000 or something like that.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.920]   What if you don't have the points?
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.080]   Like what if someone listening is like,
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.480]   "Whoa, that is the best arbitrage.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.080]   "I can save 75% on these family vacations,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.800]   "but I need 400,000 points and I don't have them."
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.160]   We've done a lot of episodes on quickly accruing points,
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.840]   like signup bonuses and all that stuff.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.360]   So we'll put that aside.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   But you built a whole business around this.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.680]   Talk a little bit about how people can get access
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.760]   to some of the great deals that points offer
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.160]   without having the points.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.800]   - Yeah, so FlyFlat started as just a side hustle of mine,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.320]   where because I was doing so much manufactured spending
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.720]   and churning of my own,
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.840]   I used some of my own miles and points
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.120]   to book friends' flights.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.720]   And for 10, 20 minutes of mileage searching,
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.240]   I could save them thousands of dollars
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.640]   and then I'd upcharge it a grand, 1,500.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.520]   And that was a nice little thing to do.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.440]   And then I learned about kind of all the liquid markets
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.960]   for transferable point currencies,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.800]   like Chase, Citi and Amex.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.600]   Fortunately, not that you as listeners get access to,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.640]   but one that I worked hard for years
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.480]   to kind of get vetted into these communities.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.800]   And as a result, now FlyFlat can basically leverage
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.080]   these miles and points on the back
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.960]   and on behalf of our clients.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.000]   And it's one of the many arbitrages
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   that we take advantage of to save our clients money.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.120]   So the reason a number of our clients
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.280]   start coming to us at the beginning
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.840]   is just the kind of headline,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.160]   "We can save you 80, 70% off a flight,"
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.200]   because those points you're talking about, Chris,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.440]   that you're saying you can buy for as cheap as four grand,
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.600]   we can then always buy for as cheap
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.640]   as not exactly four grand, but close to it,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.480]   when the retail price for all of those combined,
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.400]   you're talking about each one-way segment
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.760]   probably being 4K.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.960]   So that's like 16K versus four.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.140]   So we can then offer to you for like,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.240]   let's say we're buying it for 4,500,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.640]   all the miles and points,
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.880]   our price will end up being somewhere
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.520]   between 6,500 and 8,000,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.120]   depending on the mileage program
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.600]   and the specifics of the route.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.860]   So the way we currently serve our clients
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.200]   is through a luxury concierge product.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.040]   So that's where people are interacting with us
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.200]   on their favorite chat platform,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.840]   whether it's WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.680]   I know you have a link that you use,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.320]   I think, allthehacks.com/flyflat, F-L-Y-F-L-A-T.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.200]   And that's kind of for the luxury concierge part of things,
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.640]   and we don't actually accept everyone
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.040]   that wants to apply there through our Get Started page.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.160]   We're currently trying to keep up with the demand
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.960]   that we have and trying to scale up pretty quickly.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.400]   But we have a beta for a self-serve product
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.200]   that right now is only live in New York City,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.360]   but probably in the next few months,
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.800]   we'll have it live in the Bay Area
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.440]   and most of their major US cities
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.840]   and cities around the world.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.440]   And with that, we basically put our best mileage deals
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.400]   that you can book instantly on a website,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.880]   and then we're fulfilling it on the back end,
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.240]   and we're using miles and points
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.760]   to be able to get those deals.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.400]   And that you could find at fly-flat.com/deals.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.920]   - Awesome, we'll link to that in the show notes,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.400]   and I think if you go to allthehacks.com/flyflat,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.480]   people are gonna get, I think, $250 off their first flight.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.720]   - I forgot to mention that, yeah.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.840]   - Yeah, I asked before we started,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   I was like, "What are people gonna get?"
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.680]   And he said, "Yeah, we'll give you a special deal."
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.080]   And then, allthehacks members,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.980]   we're gonna do some other cool things.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.680]   You know, whenever I look at pictures of my kids
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.160]   from the past year, or even just a few months ago,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.720]   I am so amazed at how fast they're growing up.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.360]   And then I end up pulling my back,
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.680]   picking them both up, and it hits me hard,
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.400]   I am getting older too.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.840]   That's why planning for my family's financial security
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.560]   is a top priority.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.380]   Making sure you're prepared and have enough life insurance
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.480]   just in case something unexpected happens is crucial.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.920]   And our sponsor today, Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.780]   makes it simple to get the protection
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.480]   that's right for your family.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.160]   Fabric was designed by parents, for parents,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.880]   to help you get a high-quality,
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.820]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.360]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.400]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.680]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.160]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.920]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.680]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.640]   And you can go from start to covered in less than 10 minutes
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.560]   with no health exam required.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.300]   So join the thousands of parents who trust Fabric
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.760]   to protect their family.

[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.960]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.800]   not available in certain states,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.400]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.880]   I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.020]   and even listeners about identity theft and phishing scams
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.280]   causing so much pain and hassle,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.800]   and it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.160]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.640]   and protect our personal data.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.720]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.340]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.320]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.680]   When I first looked up our family,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.880]   there were hundreds of pieces of our personal info out there
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.060]   but thankfully I started using Delete.me
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.680]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   removed from the web,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.620]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.880]   for this episode.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.760]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.340]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.720]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.520]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.360]   and get that removed as well.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.120]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.760]   and on average, they find and remove over 2000 pieces
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.520]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.600]   When I first signed up, I was actually skeptical
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.720]   about needing a service on an ongoing basis,
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.640]   but these data brokers are relentless
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.520]   and I've seen my personal data pop up again and again
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.920]   throughout the year, so I love having a service
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.320]   that continuously sends me updated reports
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.120]   on all the removals they're doing in the background.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.320]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.400]   removed from the web, go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.840]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.440]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.920]   and supporting the show.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.760]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.460]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.240]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.780]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals,
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.040]   so please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.420]   Okay, so let's talk about this whole brokered points world
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.200]   'cause it's fascinating to me.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.920]   You said most people don't have access to it.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   There are websites out there who will buy your points,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.160]   right, so if I had millions of points, which I do,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.180]   and I was just like, I wanna cash 'em out,
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.520]   there is a world where I could do that, right?
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.920]   - Yeah, I would say email Zach at fly-dot-slot.com,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.520]   but yes, there are many services
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.760]   that you could also work with online,
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.360]   some of whom for certain miles and points
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.280]   might give you better pricing than what we can do,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.420]   but yeah, on the selling side of things,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.080]   if you're not worried about your personal information,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.560]   then I would do that, but when you're talking about
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.320]   buying and selling miles and points,
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.280]   like what you're doing mechanically often
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.560]   is giving someone access to your Amex,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.560]   your Chase, your United account,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.280]   so obviously people are probably a lot more comfortable
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.080]   doing that for United miles than they are
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.480]   for their American Express account,
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.600]   and that's why if you have a community
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   that has extremely high trust,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.120]   where you can know that there's not gonna be
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.920]   any nefariousness or fraud being committed
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.880]   when giving people access to various people's bank accounts,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.380]   then you could have a sustained edge
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.880]   and an ability to build up liquidity
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.440]   in these various miles and points.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.240]   - 'Cause I imagine one of the challenges is I go,
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.920]   oh, hey, I got a million Chase points,
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.760]   I'd like to offload them.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.840]   Someone could say, okay, well, now I'm gonna go out
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.520]   and as soon as someone wants a flight
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.360]   that's available with Chase points,
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.620]   they could email me, and then I've gotta book it for them,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.680]   and then if they have to make changes,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.040]   we have to go back and forth, and it kinda gets messy.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.640]   So I see where it actually feels like a lot more hassle
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   unless I'm willing to share my information,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.480]   and I think the average person listening
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.640]   is probably not wanna share their Chase login
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.200]   with a random person off the internet.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.640]   Maybe they will with you now that they've gotten
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.040]   to listen to you for an hour,
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.120]   but in general, we all have our cents per point value.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.600]   We know we could go to the travel portal
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.960]   and get one to 1 1/2 cents depending on our card.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.240]   My rule of thumb is try to get more than two
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.000]   when redeeming yourself.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   What is the value someone would get ballpark
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.320]   relative to those two options in this world?
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.140]   - Yeah, much worse.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.360]   If you know how to use your miles and points,
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.320]   you will always get better value using them.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.960]   So right now, the market price
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.320]   for a transferable point currency
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.560]   that's transferred in a way that has no risk
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.800]   to anyone using the points, which is very different
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.000]   than how almost every mileage broker you could find online,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.560]   and I'll get to the risks in a moment.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.160]   Market rate for those transferable point currencies
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.480]   is around 1.25, 1.3 cents per point.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.640]   So that's like the top dollar that we're paying,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   not directly to the person that's selling
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   the miles and points, but to a broker
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.200]   that does this professionally.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.160]   For the relationships where we know business owners
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.480]   ourselves, we're buying them for closer to a cent.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.000]   So again, nowhere near the price you can get yourself
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.500]   even if you're just of redeeming in a travel portal.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.180]   So if you have Chase Points, it's very trivial
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.200]   to effectively get 1.5 cents per point.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   Some flights will be marked up
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.000]   since you're really getting 1.45, 1.4,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.240]   but still much better than you can get
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.400]   by selling your miles and points.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.160]   So the people whom it makes sense to sell
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.020]   their miles or points are those that are business owners
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.880]   that are probably earning way more than 400,000 points
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.520]   a week or a month, such that even if they go to Europe
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.560]   three times a year, they couldn't possibly use
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.080]   those miles and points in an effective and efficient manner.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.200]   And many business owners,
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.800]   they don't like to travel internationally.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.040]   They just don't do it or they do it so infrequently,
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.880]   such that the best they're gonna get is statement credit
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.480]   where between 0.75 and one cent per point.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.000]   So if someone offers it to you for 1.05 or even at one cent,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.600]   but gives you the cash now versus waiting
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.920]   for the billing cycle and maybe you're paying
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.280]   whatever 1% a month on working capital
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.080]   with your credit line, it starts to now make a whole lot
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.780]   of sense to sell your miles or points for a cent.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.400]   So those are the types of business owners
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.920]   that we're either buying from directly
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.600]   or buying through brokers.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.400]   But again, I wanna emphasize the vast majority
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.020]   of miles and points you can get yourself
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.120]   by searching on the internet, you should not trust
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.680]   because a really high percentage of them,
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.920]   not a majority, but a high enough percentage
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.160]   that it's just the risk reward isn't there,
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.960]   are miles and points that were stolen,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.200]   that are being sold on behalf of business owners
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.000]   or individuals that are not gonna share their information
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.720]   and therefore there's gonna be a big time lag
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.840]   and potentially you think you own the points
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.960]   but then when you actually wanna use them,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.400]   something bad happens or you have people
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.720]   that are basically not necessarily stealing
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.000]   but doing gray area things depending
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.800]   on what your ethical standpoint is.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.360]   You know, one prime example is tons of travel agents,
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.740]   not so much in the States but other parts of the world,
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.640]   they will create frequent flyer accounts for their clients,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.560]   not tell their clients and then sell those accounts
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.720]   in those miles and points to other people.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.080]   And then periodically those clients will then realize
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.120]   and be like, oh, I want my miles and points
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.400]   but they're already sold and of course that broker
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.400]   is not gonna then alert you and refund you.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.480]   So it's very much kind of a transactional
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.200]   commoditized business online such that when I looked
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   into this before I kind of got access
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.800]   to by far the largest miles and points liquidity pool,
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.720]   I was just like, I need to stay away,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.800]   it doesn't make any sense.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.880]   Only when I learned kind of that there's really
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.000]   one community that is dealing in the majority
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.480]   of the kind of world's traded miles and points
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.000]   that I kind of opened my mind to,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.640]   oh, actually maybe you can safely and scalably
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.920]   leverage other people's miles and points.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.040]   And that kind of question about six years ago
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.240]   is now kind of the underpinning of Flyflat today.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.360]   - And I mean, I have to press you to go deeper on this,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.680]   like, you've alluded to this community,
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.120]   can you talk a little bit about the largest liquidity pool
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.320]   of miles and points in the world?
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.920]   - Yeah, so especially in what's happening in the world today
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.000]   at risk of not sounding too anti-Semitic
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.480]   as a Jewish guy from New York,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   it's largely Hasidic Jews that buy
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.060]   and sell these miles and points.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.600]   And a lot of it is for the same reasons
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.840]   that Hasidic Jews have always excelled
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.440]   in kind of the diamond trade or in banking,
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.000]   because these relationships are built on trust,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.320]   and these communities are so tight knit,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.080]   and there's such a sense of,
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.600]   I would never do something against the word of God
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.640]   or against someone in my community,
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.040]   such that you can give your bank account
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.520]   to 100 different people in your community
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.040]   and sleep at night knowing there's nothing gonna happen.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.280]   That doesn't really work outside
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.600]   of an extremely high trust society.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.540]   So I think it's really beautiful,
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.240]   the kind of high trust nature of this community.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.620]   But yeah, they're not dealing with people
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.060]   that are not very much either part of the community
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.020]   themselves or those that haven't kind of been
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.660]   really thoroughly vetted
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.620]   and know how to best do business with these folks.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.660]   - I remember when we first talked,
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.860]   I was like, "Oh, this is interesting.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.900]   "Should I start a business here?"
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.100]   And you were like, "You're not Jewish."
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.940]   - Non-starter.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.840]   - Like, it's just not even an option.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.800]   And you spent years getting vetted
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.960]   to try to get into this,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   to be able to build the business you had today.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.480]   So I think that's pretty kind of special and cool.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   And how big is it?
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.880]   How many miles and points do you think
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.200]   are flowing through this community?
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.640]   - Yeah, so a lot of people ask me this.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.440]   I'm literally in WhatsApp groups
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.040]   where billions of miles and points
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.920]   are being traded every single day.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.880]   And there's many suppliers and people
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.120]   that are not in these WhatsApp groups
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.360]   that are doing volumes much, much greater
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.680]   than that on top of it.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.020]   So it's not limitless, but think about the fact
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.960]   that some exponential number higher
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.100]   than what the global GDP is
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.660]   is the number of miles and points
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.500]   that were given away every single year.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.780]   And then just think about the number
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.060]   of business owners and businesses
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.860]   that are not optimizing those miles and points,
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.740]   which is the vast, vast majority,
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.700]   and then the subset of them that are working
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.780]   to kind of sell them.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.500]   And it's not just only Jewish business owners
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.780]   doing this, of course,
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.300]   although it's certainly overrepresented.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.420]   But yeah, there's a lot of business owners
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.780]   that build a personal relationship
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.780]   with a broker in person,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.580]   and they feel comfortable giving the broker
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.420]   that information.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.200]   So when we're buying transferable point currencies,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.060]   a good amount of the time,
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.180]   we don't actually have access to the Amex account ourselves,
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.100]   but we're working with a broker that we know
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.060]   during certain hours is like online 24/7.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.540]   Because without those relationships,
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.420]   a lot of this doesn't work.
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.260]   So we've automated a lot of, hey,
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.100]   after the points are transferred to mileage accounts
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.500]   we create for our clients on our back end,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.740]   how do we automate that?
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.220]   But Amex doesn't have APIs
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.420]   'cause they don't really want this happening at scale.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.760]   So you kind of need those relationships
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.500]   where there's high trust and there's extreme responsiveness.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.860]   So yes, you could build this not tapping the community
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.520]   that's largely doing this today,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.420]   but it would be extremely difficult.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.820]   And I've been able to focus on providing a great product
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.820]   for my customers and not kind of the operational
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.860]   scaling miles and points as a result,
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.780]   where I know some of our competitors
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.060]   have had to work really hard
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.180]   to get vetted by this community.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.220]   And yes, we do have competitors that are not Jewish
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.180]   that do business with a subset of the community,
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.940]   but it's different.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.460]   And I'll leave it at that for the podcast.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.380]   Maybe you and I can talk about it a little bit after.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.740]   Then they have their own relationships too.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.300]   And those other relationships just, things just break.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.380]   And when you look at kind of the risk management approach
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.140]   to take it fly flat, like we're not okay
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.320]   with a 0.03% chance of things breaking
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.960]   when our client is going for an important business meeting
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.180]   or going to see their family over the holidays.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.820]   So I think that's why mileage, brokering, all this stuff,
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.360]   I think fairly has kind of a not a good name
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.180]   because such a high percentage of the time
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.100]   for whatever business there is,
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.540]   there's issues that happen,
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.300]   even if it's one, two, three, 4% of the time
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.500]   that gives the whole thing a bad name
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.740]   and makes the whole thing not trustworthy.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.260]   So a big part of what I'm trying to do
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.800]   is basically scale this and eventually even have it
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.860]   be something that is completely loved
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.020]   in partnering with the airline,
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.260]   similar like a Hotel Tonight.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.540]   Hotel Tonight, Uber, a lot of these services,
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.260]   they took advantage of a fundamental
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.180]   supply and demand desire on both sides of the market,
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.980]   even though maybe the laws and regulations
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.640]   and the desires, the companies that they were working with
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.140]   did not see that vision.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.480]   But eventually, if you understand the reality of the fact
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.780]   that airlines want there to be money going in their pocket
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.700]   for every business class seat
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.380]   and they don't know how to sell them effectively,
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.620]   they should work with someone that knows
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.300]   how to sell those last minute seats more effectively.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.260]   Ergo with hotels, you have Hotel Tonight,
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.420]   huge, one of the big exits to the travel space.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.580]   So I think there's a big opportunity for that.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.260]   - One thing that got me thinking is
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.440]   FlyFlat effectively provides two really big values.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.940]   The average person doesn't have to do any searching, right?
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.700]   They could say, "Oh, I wanna go here,"
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.440]   and you both find the flight and broker the points.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.940]   Is there a world where someone who is willing
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.400]   to do the searching, but doesn't have the points,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.700]   could get access to something at a lower spread?
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.620]   Or do they just need to find a broker
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.440]   or take someone like me, let's say I had no points,
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.220]   but I know how to get the deals.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.780]   Is there a product for me?
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.180]   - If you book more than five plus business class flights
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.620]   a year and you're booking within a month of the date,
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.340]   email me at zac@fly-flat.com and we'll figure something out.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.620]   - So biggest arbitrage opportunity, miles and points.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.000]   We've talked about it a ton on the show.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.860]   If you have the points, there are tools that make it easier.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.300]   If you don't have the points,
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.780]   there are places like what you've built
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.580]   that can give you access to some of those savings.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.020]   Let's move on because I know we have
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.980]   like eight or nine other things.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.380]   So like miles and points, like you said,
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.660]   isn't always gonna be the way to get the best deal.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.100]   I'll just share one quick one,
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.060]   which is around gift cards and flight credits.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.600]   And so let's say you don't find a perfect deal,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.020]   which we're gonna get to.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.780]   I just wanna make sure I plug that Southwest gift cards
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.000]   go on sale all the time, right?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.860]   You could buy Southwest gift cards on Costco for 14% off.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.720]   I bought some around the holidays at Sam's Club for 20% off
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.440]   and you could buy in fairly reasonable quantities.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.220]   You could buy $500 or $2,000.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.020]   So that is one where I would say is one,
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.300]   maybe we can say more than 14 to 20% off later
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.540]   and not all airlines gift cards go on sale
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.220]   and you might not know which airline you need,
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.460]   but if there's an airline that you know
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.700]   you're gonna fly on regularly
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.540]   and you can get consistent big return, I think that's great.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.500]   - For sure.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.000]   You probably listen to Acquired Podcast, Chris?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.340]   - I would say like I've listened to one episode.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.180]   - Cool, well, for anyone that's curious
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.980]   about how Costco can make those economics work,
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.780]   one of my favorite Acquired episodes is on Costco
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.220]   and they have kind of a whole section around like,
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.820]   they're making money net on like selling Southwest
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.660]   at 13% off.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.020]   Like how the hell does this work?
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.460]   So just something I found enjoyable.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.520]   I think some of your listeners will enjoy as well.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.360]   - Oh, awesome.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.740]   I will definitely listen to that episode.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.980]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.540]   That was just one that I wanted to throw out there,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.620]   but you have this list.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.140]   Let's start with the next one,
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.900]   which is around hidden cities.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.940]   - Yeah, so just as a primer for people
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.220]   who haven't heard of hidden city,
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.120]   hidden city is this concept of basically hiding the city
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.660]   you actually wanna go to to the airlines
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.020]   when you're booking the ticket.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.340]   So an example that I like to give a lot is,
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.740]   okay, let's use you and Chris, San Francisco,
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.980]   and you wanna go to New York City.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.580]   Almost 100% of the time,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.460]   it will be cheaper for you to book a ticket
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.900]   to Cleveland or Puerto Rico or someplace
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.740]   within a few hours of New York, connecting in New York,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.900]   than to book the nonstop to New York.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.980]   And the reason for this is because,
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.820]   like a lot of businesses,
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.780]   airlines don't price based on what their costs are
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.980]   and add something, only Costco's like that,
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.340]   in their pure form.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.980]   They price based on what they think they can get.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.540]   And the average person traveling between SF and New York
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.500]   has a lot more money
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.740]   and is much more likely to be a business traveler
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.380]   that is expensing the flight to their business
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.100]   versus paying for it for themselves
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.900]   so they can charge more money for it.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.540]   The company that popularized this was called Skiplagged.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.260]   It's still around, Skiplagged today.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.980]   And it was started by a college student
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.420]   as like a side hustle, side project thing.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.620]   And then he got sued by United.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.380]   And the lawsuit by United was incredible for his business.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.300]   So I always tell people like, maybe I'll regret it,
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.260]   but like getting sued by United doesn't sound that bad
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.380]   because it's insanely awesome free press
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.540]   because everyone hates the airlines.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.140]   So the media is always like,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.180]   look at this underdog who's getting sued by the airlines.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.380]   And the guy raised like a legal fund of like 100K
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.820]   or something within like a day or a week.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.460]   And one, because ultimately doing Hidden City,
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.620]   doing a lot of, I'd say, some of like the best hacks,
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.780]   the two things that were responsible
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.100]   for the biggest discounts of Fly Fly
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.420]   at Hidden City and Miles and Points arbitrage,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.700]   can, depending on how you do them,
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.140]   violate the terms of service
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.500]   of your contract of carriage with the airline.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.500]   But are still perfectly legal to do.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.980]   So they're kind of like card counting
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.020]   where the airlines don't want you to do them,
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.540]   but they're perfectly legal to do.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.580]   And from my perspective, there's nothing morally wrong
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.580]   with taking advantage of their pricing and efficiency.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.740]   So the way most people do Hidden City today
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.780]   does violate the airline terms of service.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.940]   So I think the risk of doing that
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.540]   once, twice, maybe three times a year
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.860]   is really low on any individual airline.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.020]   But if you start doing this a lot,
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.300]   especially on the same alliance,
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.780]   you wanna be careful and understand
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.820]   that they might take away your miles and points
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.380]   and there might be some issues with them.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.940]   So just fair warning.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.940]   I'll get to the way Fly Fly books them.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.220]   We actually don't violate the terms of service.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.140]   How exactly we do that,
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.900]   I'm gonna keep a little closer to the vest.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.180]   But there are ways to take advantage
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.120]   of Hidden City ticketing
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.320]   without violating the terms of service.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.360]   Okay, we take your typical Hidden City ticket.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.320]   So you can basically rely on like a kayak
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.540]   or someone to find it for you.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.460]   So today, even the company's largest kayak
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.740]   is regularly putting out Hidden City inventory
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.800]   on their website.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.340]   The way they get around it with the airlines
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.460]   and who knows how long this will be the case
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:08.180]   is they're linking to an OTA that's doing Hidden City.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.540]   So they're just aggregating OTAs.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.140]   They're not putting their own Hidden City inventory
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.140]   out there, but it's now a somewhat popular thing
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.500]   that you can book.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.140]   But really, by far, all the best Hidden Cities
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.380]   come from tooling with this yourself.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.360]   And this is kind of the second big thing
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.060]   that we ended up investing in a lot of time and money into
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.380]   to basically find these kind of better arts.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.700]   And to illustrate it, I can share my screen, Chris,
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.620]   or you can play around with this
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.100]   if you're listening at home.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.620]   Let's take a flight this Saturday,
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.340]   which was February 3rd, from London to New York City.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.740]   Book a nonstop flight.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.980]   That's gonna retail for, depending on which flight
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:45.780]   you look at, nine, 10, 11 grand
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.700]   as of the time of this recording, January 31st.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:52.620]   Now, if you add a connecting leg
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.620]   from JFK to Montego Bay, Jamaica,
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:01.440]   that flight is gonna come down to $2,400.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.980]   So you're just adding this few hour layover
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.820]   that you don't intend to take,
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.300]   and now you've magically saved $7,000.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.700]   So this is kind of one example of all the ways
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.920]   you can have absolutely insane savings by Hidden City.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.200]   And it took a while, but we basically automated
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.820]   the subset of ways to do this
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.980]   that doesn't violate airline TOS
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.340]   so that we can just systematically save people
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.500]   a lot of money.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.380]   And Hidden City is much more ubiquitous
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.580]   than miles and points.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.960]   So even if you're pretty flexible,
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.800]   just miles and points deals don't exist for most flights.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.300]   But on certain routes, Hidden City,
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.400]   especially when the retail price for business and first
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.960]   is routinely above five grand,
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.040]   it'll be reliable on certain routes 80, 90% of the time,
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.640]   no matter how close or how far you are
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.760]   from booking the ticket.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.160]   - One thing I've always been told is
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.040]   if you have a layover and you check a bag,
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.020]   your bag's going through.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.160]   So in your example, someone flying from London to New York,
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.960]   maybe they do have a bag.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.320]   They're probably actually okay there
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.580]   'cause in customs in the US,
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.500]   you're gonna have to collect your bags and recheck them.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.960]   So maybe that's okay.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.220]   But there are places,
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.820]   I know if they were flying from Dublin,
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.820]   they would do pre-clearance
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.700]   so they wouldn't have to check their bags.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.060]   How does that play into Hidden City ticketing?
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.860]   - So the way Flyflat does it,
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.060]   you could always check your bag.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.500]   There's never an issue.
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.780]   But if you're gonna kind of do it normally by yourself
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.180]   or through kayak or if you've stripped lag,
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.500]   yes, that's definitely an issue.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.580]   You're smart to understand like, yes,
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.740]   if you're connecting and not doing pre-customs in Dublin
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.580]   or Abu Dhabi or whatever the few countries that have that,
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   if you're connecting in the US, you can get away with it.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.220]   But yes, definitely don't check a bag
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.220]   if your bag is gonna go all the way through.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.820]   And don't proactively attach
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.460]   your frequent flyer mile ticket to the ticket either.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.900]   Certain airlines are better than others.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.360]   I'll leave the Alliance and the guy somewhat anonymous,
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.900]   but I once was taking a flight from Europe
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.140]   to the States business class.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.540]   And I ended up chatting with an analyst
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:55.100]   at one of the big three American aviation companies.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.380]   And we started talking about my business.
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.140]   And he's like, yeah, like I tried to basically get
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.980]   my leadership to care about extreme hidden city
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.820]   that's happening.
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.700]   So you can probably figure out which airline this is not
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.460]   based on the one that's cracked down the most
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.300]   on hidden city as of recent.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.860]   But he's like, I built a pretty easy script
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.940]   that basically identify when people are doing it
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.300]   more than 10 times in a single year
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.140]   using their frequent flyer number.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.660]   And it ended up not being good politically
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.940]   for him and his career.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.060]   Not in I think a big way,
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.480]   but like they just didn't wanna hear it.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.340]   Just other priorities didn't really care.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.180]   Something I always try to remember
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:34.460]   is you just never underestimate how slow things can move
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.340]   when you're talking about big, large,
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.660]   effectively kind of like quasi-governmental organizations
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.880]   like the way the airlines are.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.220]   So there is risk here,
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.940]   especially like with American Airlines
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.580]   and the One World Alliance.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.500]   But listen, if you can save a few thousand bucks,
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.740]   especially on a business class ticket
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.940]   and you're doing it once a year, you're totally fine.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.620]   They're never gonna like take away your miles
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.900]   or do something just from doing one ticket.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.880]   So this is definitely by far the most advanced mode thing.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.680]   Like you're probably not gonna do this yourself, Chris,
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.600]   which like says a lot.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.720]   This is probably for like a very small percentage
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.560]   of the people that are listening,
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.760]   but you can become an expert in Hidden City
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.520]   and play around with this stuff manually.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.040]   Or then of course you could just outsource it to us
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.880]   and we'll do it for you every time.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.000]   But frankly, I really enjoyed learning about this.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.760]   It was just kind of the next big like thing
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.400]   and opportunity besides miles and points
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.440]   that's still like not understood.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.700]   There's no tools out there.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.640]   It's much more of kind of a black box.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.760]   - And I guess a couple of questions.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.520]   So what about economy?
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.640]   What about domestic?
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.800]   Is it still work in those scenarios?
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.680]   - Just not as well.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.200]   So for domestic, there's just much less of an ARB here
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.160]   to the point where like,
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.160]   I wouldn't really worry about doing it yourself
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.640]   until you start talking about tickets
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.940]   that are well over $1,000 per ticket.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.680]   Using skiplag.com for anything below that,
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.280]   it's gonna be your 80/20 for this.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.800]   So definitely would recommend using skiplag
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.160]   a few times a year if you're comfortable with that risk
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.360]   and not checking any bags.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.280]   But if you're not gonna check a bag,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.000]   put your frequent flyer number in
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.520]   and you're going to use this sparingly
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.100]   on a per alliance basis,
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.600]   I think it's a really great risk reward
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.240]   and I recommend it to my friends all the time.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.120]   - You said not to put your frequent flyer number in
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.960]   at the start.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.680]   Does that mean that maybe you could claim those miles
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   after the flight?
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.780]   Or how do you think about
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.800]   when to put your frequent flyer number in?
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.680]   You know, if I'm taking a business class flight
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.480]   from San Francisco through New York to Montego Bay
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.240]   or something like, I want those miles.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.700]   - Well, would you rather have this $8,000 of savings
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.500]   in cash or the $800 worth of miles?
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.780]   That's your risk calculus there.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.120]   So I think if you're gonna be as aggressive
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.760]   as doing like a hidden city
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.120]   that saves you thousands of dollars in business class,
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.720]   I think you should just leave the miles on the table
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.080]   and not try to get them.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.600]   At least would be my personal risk reward calculus
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.640]   as someone who is no stranger to risk
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.920]   when it comes to this stuff.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.320]   But yes, if you're doing it once a year,
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.960]   putting your frequent flyer number in,
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.880]   especially if you use a different airport
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.700]   that happens after the place you want to go,
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.280]   and that changes every time once or twice a year,
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.040]   I think you're probably fine.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.760]   Again, I just wouldn't advise doing it
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.920]   because I think when you start talking
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.660]   about the more premium routes,
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.080]   potentially it's like, okay,
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.440]   you know, one hidden city on this save 100 bucks, it's fine.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.000]   Some airlines might have a flag of like,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.080]   oh, wow, this person is doing this
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.580]   in a way that's really obvious
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.680]   that cost us a lot in lost revenue.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.140]   I think they think about the lost revenue incorrectly
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.200]   and a lot of people that they lost the revenue
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   and purchased a $10,000 ticket
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.760]   would have never purchased a $10,000 ticket originally.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.840]   But again, you don't wanna risk your miles
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.680]   and points going away.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.480]   That's my advice, but I don't think it's crazy
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.840]   to put your frequent flyer number in
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.680]   for some of these cases,
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.280]   especially if you're doing it very infrequently.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.320]   - What more can you tell me if I wanna push harder
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.000]   on like the whole contract of carriage?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.520]   It sounds like you don't wanna share all of your secrets,
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.140]   but I imagine everyone listening right now is like,
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.640]   okay, so there is a way.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.240]   I wanna figure out the way.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.540]   - Read the contract of carriage.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.120]   Read the relevant sections
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.040]   and think about how tickets are booked.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.140]   That's how I figure it out.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:45.980]   Do the work.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.520]   - What I hear you say is if someone goes through
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.880]   and reads the contract of carriage
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.680]   with United or American or Delta,
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.800]   it sounds like if they wanna put the time and energy in,
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   they could probably come up with a creative solution.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.640]   - Yeah.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.920]   I don't think that's a good expectation for everyone,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.900]   but I think amongst your really savvy listenership,
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.480]   I think if you had a bunch of people that did it,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   I'm sure at least one person would come up with something.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.320]   You wanna do it a little bit more now than the standard way,
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.960]   I'd say Godspeed and feel free to email me as well
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.480]   if you end up being that person.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.560]   - I feel like armed with the contract of carriage,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.120]   our audience and ChatGPT as our free legal service,
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.800]   which by the way, I'm not recommending anyone use
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.640]   in lieu of a lawyer,
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.660]   but for a circumstance like this could work,
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.560]   I'm curious also.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.400]   So if anyone figures out some ideas,
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.480]   feel free to email me.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.360]   So, okay.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.920]   So Hidden Cities, next one on my list is VPN arbitrage.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.740]   - Yeah.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.420]   So VPN arbitrage is kind of similar to Hidden City,
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:37.440]   which is like, I've built a bot for this now
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.720]   that automates this.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.480]   And like, I don't have the patience
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.040]   to do this manually anymore.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.460]   That's another thing where it's like, listen,
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.600]   it's out there if you're willing to just put the reps in
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.400]   of looking at the things manually,
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.420]   or you're able to build software yourself
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.760]   if you're listening to this.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.600]   It's a much easier concept and a lot less dynamic
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.400]   and complex than Hidden City.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.880]   But basically, when I say VPN arbitrage,
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.100]   this means airlines price tickets based on how much
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.640]   they think people will pay.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.000]   And people that are coming in through an IP address
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.680]   in San Francisco, on average will probably pay more
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.280]   than people coming in from an IP address
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.920]   in a much poorer part of the world, maybe not in the city.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.880]   So this doesn't happen often.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.680]   It actually, as a percentage basis, really rarely happens.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.200]   But some of the time, certain individual airlines
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.600]   will price things more cheaply
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.440]   for certain IP addresses than others.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.960]   So if you know what those IP addresses are,
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.320]   and you know which routes and airlines it's relevant for,
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.640]   you then just book every single flight
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.780]   using a VPN that goes to that place.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.280]   So this is something that you could kind of
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.680]   just play around with.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:39.560]   Similar to the Montego Bay example, right now,
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.840]   booking a lot of the Middle Eastern airlines
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.600]   out of Sri Lanka.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.680]   You get the best deals, of course,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.320]   if you're originating in Sri Lanka.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.960]   But even if you're just using a VPN to go to Sri Lanka,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.440]   you could often find pretty great deals
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.080]   on a fraction of Qatar and Emirates and Etihad right now.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.460]   But there's lots more.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.680]   They're constantly changing.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.000]   It's like a whack-a-mole thing.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.280]   The way, at least, it happened organically for me is,
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.960]   okay, you have this big incentive
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.280]   to find it for your business,
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.920]   and you love finding the deals,
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.920]   so you manually just do it until you figure it out,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.840]   and then you figure out how to kind of make that scale.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.120]   But I don't think the investment makes sense
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.480]   unless you're doing this on behalf of many other people,
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.280]   given how much time it took me,
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.480]   and how, again, you're not talking about crazy deals here.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.000]   With Hidden City, you can get 70, 80% off sometimes.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.880]   Maybe on average, it's more like 30.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.120]   VPN, the best you'll ever get is like 10%.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.440]   But the nice thing about VPN overcharge
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.160]   is that it stacks with everything else.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.840]   So if there's an ARB there,
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.920]   and it's valid for this airline and this route,
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.280]   you can then add that to any one of these other things.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.360]   So if you find an ARB on the airline that you fly most,
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.880]   because let's say you find a great ARB
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.480]   for United or Star Alliance,
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.880]   that's all you fly and you live in like SF,
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.720]   then yeah, like putting the time in
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:55.220]   to find something that can add 6% off to all your flights,
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.920]   all your family's flights, all your friends' flights,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.080]   it might make sense to do.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.980]   - And are there groups of airline types
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.660]   where you've seen more or less of this,
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.480]   like the American, US kind of main carriers,
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.600]   Asian carriers, European carriers?
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.660]   - I'd say for your audience,
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.760]   the IPs that are most relevant
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.020]   change on a pretty frequent basis.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.480]   There's not one that's lasted for more than a month
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.680]   for like over a year
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.400]   that at least we've been able to find.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.320]   - But as far as to know if it's worth,
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.080]   right, like I've got my NordVPN,
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.060]   I could just go cycle through IP addresses
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.460]   all around the world and check,
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:31.100]   but am I better off doing that for international flights
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.060]   to a particular geography?
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.520]   - I wouldn't bother for domestic.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.340]   Yeah, if you wanna go and cycle,
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.560]   and you can build yourself a script
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.000]   to have the VPN do that automatically
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.340]   so you don't have to do it yourself,
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.800]   I would recommend doing it
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.840]   when you're going long haul international,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.800]   especially if you're going from originating
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.640]   in not one of the wealthier parts of the world.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.520]   So the IPs where this is relevant
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.440]   are ones where the GDP is significantly lower
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.840]   than the metropolitan cities of North America and Europe.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.000]   - So don't go Paris, Rome, London, go other places.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.400]   And funny enough, I'm thinking right now
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.080]   my EA is based in Sri Lanka.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.720]   Her arbitrage is actually just turn the VPN off,
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.520]   'cause normally she's running the VPN
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.440]   to search for a US IP.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.040]   I'm like, no, no, no, when you're doing flights,
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.280]   just turn it off.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.100]   So that's great.
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.520]   - But it's hard to do it efficiently
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.180]   because most of these ARBs only exist
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.120]   directly with the airline as well.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.880]   So just keep that in mind too.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.280]   So when you're doing this,
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.020]   Google Flights is like 0% of the time,
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:28.860]   those deals are gonna show up.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.120]   They're gonna be special fares
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.820]   that are not necessarily advertised as special fares
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.280]   directly on the airline's website.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.260]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.960]   Okay, so that's on VPNs.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.720]   One thing I've always wondered about is consolidators.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.720]   Like I remember back in the day,
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.560]   I'd been hearing about,
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.000]   "Oh, these bulk deals that you can get
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.500]   "from people that are really,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.320]   "you can't change your flights or anything."
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.020]   I don't know anything about consolidators
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.160]   other than what I just said.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.280]   Can you give me a little overview of that industry
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.640]   and whether there's a way to save there?
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.320]   - Yeah, I'd say the TLDR for your listeners,
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.560]   if you're booking travel for yourself,
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.240]   there's not, and it's not worth it.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.560]   So we work with a number of consolidators
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.120]   and we've worked really hard
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.460]   to work with some of the best in the industry
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:10.460]   and we've fired many and moved on from many in the past.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:14.720]   But basically this industry is people going directly
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.120]   without any software technology to an airline
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.940]   and saying, "Hey, we can basically buy these off your books
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.400]   "at big amount for less than you think
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.080]   "you're gonna sell them in advance
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.760]   "such that it makes financial sense for you.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.640]   "And then we have the problem of kind of selling
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.700]   "more tickets than you think that you could sell
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.240]   "at a certain price point."
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.700]   And of course, some of consolidators, more modern ones
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.860]   are using some degree of software to analyze this,
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.220]   but this is not like an automated market transaction.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.860]   These are like emails and phone calls and handshakes
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.340]   and lots of vetting and compliance.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.420]   And then these companies basically exclusively sell
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.540]   to other travel agencies and other travel businesses
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:52.860]   of different kinds.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:57.040]   So I'd say consolidators, like in our waterfall at Flyflat,
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.920]   like consolidators is always after Hidden City
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.260]   and Miles and Points Arbitrage.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.900]   So like the absolute best you're gonna get
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.620]   with a consolidator is like 20%,
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.820]   where these other ones can get way better than that.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.820]   And I'd say our average with the consolidators
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.680]   were maybe getting like seven or 8% off.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.060]   So only if you're like regularly going business
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.300]   in first class on a specific airline, a specific route
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.460]   that you know you're gonna repeat many times per year,
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.700]   and you think that's gonna continue for years,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.380]   that's kind of the only case it could make sense to onboard.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.100]   But no consolidator is gonna wanna work with you
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.740]   because you're gonna be too small volume
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.260]   and not worth the compliance headache for them
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.660]   to onboard you.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.980]   So if that describes you and you want some advice,
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.380]   you can feel free to email me at zach@fly-flat.com
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.060]   and I'm happy to give you some pointers
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.020]   or point you in the right direction.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.260]   I don't make any money off of referral deals
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.680]   or whatever with consolidators,
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.820]   but it's not an easy group of folks to work with.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.020]   It's slow, it's all manual.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.820]   So there's no like APIs we have to like book these flights.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.540]   So as a result, it's not a great experience
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.420]   to like see a fare and have to wait many hours
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.820]   to see the fare changes.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.780]   So overall, just like kind of a big headache,
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.060]   probably move on.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.260]   But if you think you should have moved on
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.660]   and you want to ask me some questions, I'm happy to help.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.800]   - So there's not a place to search these online
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.060]   and just be like, I wanna go to Japan,
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.900]   is there a good consolidator fare?
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.140]   - No, and the whole thing,
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.500]   the opportunity in travel is always in the opaque fares.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.540]   And every airline and hotel will always have some contract
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.580]   that says, hey, you cannot advertise below the price
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.180]   that I say it's going to be publicly.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.340]   So the way people get around this
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.140]   is by having like members clubs at different times.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.860]   Like, hey, you pay us this membership,
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.940]   maybe the membership was only 99 cents a month,
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.040]   and now you get access to everything that's much cheaper.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.260]   So it's the same thing that I just hear,
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.180]   which is like, if someone was like,
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.340]   hey, I'm gonna automate and scale all the consolidators,
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.460]   I'll just be like, okay, no, we don't want that.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.100]   We only want this because it's not automated.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.660]   It doesn't always make a lot of sense
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.740]   when you're looking at the logic
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.100]   of the kind of airline revenue management,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.140]   but that's, I'd say, the way that they approach this.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.980]   So I think similar to like miles and points,
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.580]   there might be some innovation in this medium long term,
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.140]   but it's gonna require a lot of lobbying
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.580]   of the airline executives to be okay with this
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.820]   and go against what's been working for decades.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.180]   - Okay, so another one that I think
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.640]   might end up being similar, but is particularly relevant,
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.100]   especially for me, is around travel agents
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.100]   and whether travel agents can get you a good deal,
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.740]   whether there's any margin there.
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.520]   And I asked this both for listeners
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.100]   who are probably not travel agents,
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.460]   but I actually have an iota number.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.500]   So to the extent that I should be using it
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.740]   to get a deal, I'd love to personally know,
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.240]   but I'm also curious how this works.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.260]   And we'll shelve all hotels aside and focus just on flights
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.700]   because I feel like I get how that world works,
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.240]   but on the flight side, I've never really found
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.060]   that it was worth trying to go into it.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.280]   - Even at our volume today, Chris,
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.580]   we barely get any good contracts or deals
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.420]   with our iota number.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.300]   So again, there's a lot to talk about with hotels,
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.780]   but if we're gonna shelve that,
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.340]   it's just not worth it to use your own iota number.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.660]   That being said, using a travel agency
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.420]   that has a lot of volume,
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.660]   or like most travel agencies like FlyFlat,
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.340]   we then piggyback on other people's iota numbers
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.580]   in kind of opaque ways, that can make a lot of sense.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.020]   But you going through the hassle
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.160]   of having your own iota number for airline flights
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.000]   is not gonna make sense.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.420]   And if you have it because it makes sense
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.340]   for your hotel spend, you're just basically never going
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.220]   to actually get any commission on the flights.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.340]   - What would you search for if you were a random person
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.700]   that's like, well, I go to Asia two, three times a year,
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.140]   should I find a travel agent
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.060]   to try to help me buy these business class tickets
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.300]   to save money?
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.060]   I mean, obviously this is low in the waterfall
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.580]   because you're probably gonna have a higher likelihood
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.860]   of saving on everything else.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.460]   But are these just like find a Japan travel agent
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.220]   and they might have these negotiated agreements
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.220]   and contracts to get better deals?
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.040]   - Yeah, it depends.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.380]   And just also depends on kind of what you're expecting
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.900]   from a service perspective and a responsiveness.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:52.300]   So basically all travel agencies are really, really slow
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.340]   relative to you doing it yourself.
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.620]   So if that's important to you,
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.620]   that's also something to keep in mind.
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.880]   But yeah, I think it can definitely make sense,
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.580]   especially if you're doing one route routinely,
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.940]   where a certain agency has better negotiated contracts there.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.540]   But in general, like special negotiated contracts
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.660]   with airlines are maybe like one or 2%
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.580]   of what they used to be a decade ago,
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.420]   and well under 1% of what they used to be 15 years ago.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.020]   So the airlines are very much like,
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.580]   we don't wanna give travel agents any money
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.580]   and we wanna have everyone booked directly on our sites.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.220]   And now we even tell our clients at Flyflats sometimes
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.500]   that like, hey, listen, we can't do miles or points
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.620]   or hidden city or this for this flight.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.820]   And Emirates is offering you a special fare
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.700]   that's 8.5% lower than the retail price.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.120]   You should book that yourself.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.180]   And if you have a Chase Sapphire Reserve or an Amex Platinum,
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.140]   you should then use that.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.420]   So airlines are more and more certain ones,
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.280]   especially like I'd say American airlines in the States
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.260]   and Emirates are being really good
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.140]   about incentivizing their customer base
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.580]   to book directly with them.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.460]   So the short answer is it depends.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.940]   And the long answer is if you're flying business class,
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.860]   very regularly to a specific place,
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.180]   it's worth making the investment.
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.500]   But if that doesn't describe you,
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   I'd say it probably doesn't make sense to look into this.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.400]   - One area that I'll share that I looked into
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.540]   that I was actually surprised wasn't a huge saving,
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.880]   so low on the waterfall,
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.380]   but pretty accessible for business owners
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:18.260]   is joining the business program of different airlines.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.820]   And so I can't speak to a lot of them,
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.460]   but because we're in San Francisco and we have a company,
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.820]   I looked at the United for Business program
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.260]   and they have various tiers
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.880]   of what kind of savings you'll get.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.660]   And they basically make you pick, it was kind of funny.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.260]   They're like, do you want the one
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.860]   that gives you really, really high discounts
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.000]   on all the incremental stuff,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.640]   like lounge access and economy plus and all this stuff?
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.600]   Or do you just want the one
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.020]   that gives you the maximum discount on flights?
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.820]   And if you choose the maximum discount on flights,
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.040]   you're peaking at about 8%.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.580]   And that's on the more expensive fares.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:56.260]   And then it can be as low as two to 4% on the cheaper fares.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.860]   So again, in the realm of how much you're gonna save,
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.040]   I would expect that over the course of the year
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.180]   with all the flights I book, I might save 4%.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:07.260]   It doesn't even include some of the super discounted fares.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.860]   So it's like on half the fares, I might say 4%.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.260]   So it's not a huge savings,
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.660]   but if you're flying a lot of business class,
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.580]   maybe that's a little higher.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.420]   If you're buying a lot of full fare tickets,
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.540]   maybe it's higher.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.440]   But if you run a company, I don't see any reason
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.960]   not to sign up and enroll your employees to potentially save.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.380]   And there are options for, in some of these programs,
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.600]   the company earns some points
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.980]   and everyone kind of benefits together.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.680]   So definitely something that I would say to look into.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.520]   I don't know how much,
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.040]   it doesn't really work for your business
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.500]   'cause you're not doing this for your employees,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.780]   but I don't know if you have anything else to add there.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.620]   - Yeah, not much to add.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.740]   I would just put this in the category like portals,
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:46.580]   which is you can consistently save a few points using this.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.360]   And when I say points, I mean finance points,
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.540]   like percentages off the flight,
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.180]   not actual like transferable point currencies.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.020]   But if you're listening to this
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.860]   and gotten this far in the podcast,
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.420]   I would hope that you've gotten much bigger savings
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.380]   through one of the previous things before going to this.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.020]   And that, yes, this might even be additive,
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.260]   but it's so small
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.860]   relative to just doing these other bigger things well
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.580]   that I wouldn't worry about it,
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.840]   but it's really easy to just enroll.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.620]   So if you're not enrolled, you might as well just do it,
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.140]   but I wouldn't expect too much from it.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.460]   - On United, every time I log into my United account,
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.540]   I have one of these and it's like,
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.540]   ooh, the fare went from 220 down to like 216.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.860]   It's a very small savings, but it's also no work.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.180]   So the earlier thing people are doing wrong,
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.180]   it's like putting the work in the wrong way.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.140]   So I'm spending no time on this,
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.100]   but the reward is pretty low.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.780]   We're just thinking of that United flight,
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.940]   which is a flight to LA.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.180]   It made me think back to the miles and points thing,
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.500]   which is, we didn't really say this.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.180]   A lot of the tools give this answer,
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:48.420]   but finding the deals is not just finding the inventory
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   of the deal, it's also finding the program to book through.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.640]   I've talked about this a lot,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.980]   but I'll just share my one example, which was,
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.060]   I wanted to fly from San Francisco to Burbank.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.660]   The flights were $300.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.940]   United had it for 15,000 points,
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.380]   but Avianca Life Miles had it for 6,500 points.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.580]   And so step one, find the inventory.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:09.980]   Step two, see if it's cheaper, but don't waste your time.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.300]   So in that particular scenario, I looked,
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.180]   I was like, 300 bucks.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.820]   I was like, if it were a hundred bucks,
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.800]   I would've just booked it, right?
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.340]   It wasn't even gonna be worth my time
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.000]   'cause what's the best deal I'm gonna find?
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.020]   At 300, I was like, look,
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.240]   I'm not looking at other airports,
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.620]   I'm not looking at other times.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.180]   And I went to Point.me and I said,
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.700]   I'm looking for these dates.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:27.700]   And I searched and I was like,
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:29.020]   is there a better way to book this?
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:29.940]   Yes, I'll book it.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.140]   No, move on.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.580]   I think we forgot to flag that
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.860]   it's not just about finding the space.
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.420]   A lot of these tools you search for
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.620]   might find you the best saver inventory,
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.900]   but it's also about what program you book through.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.500]   And that's where some of the tools like Point.me
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.820]   do a good job of the instruction of here's how to do that.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.620]   So let's shove all that.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.460]   And let's go to one of the most exciting ones,
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.020]   which we haven't hit yet,
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.740]   because I feel like there's just this mystique around it,
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.340]   which is around buddy passes.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.180]   Now that we have kids, I'm like, this just isn't a thing,
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.400]   but there was a window of time in life where I was like,
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.240]   how do I get this?
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.100]   I met a friend and he's like, oh yeah, I got a buddy pass.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.500]   How does this world work?
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.820]   How hard is it to find the seats, to find the access?
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:09.700]   How much does it cost?
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.060]   How do you get one?
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:11.900]   Let me know.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.740]   - This is definitely one of the more gray
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.320]   or the darker shades of gray
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.420]   of the different strategies we've discussed.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.020]   So a buddy pass is something that you have,
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.520]   no matter if you're like a baggage handler
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.260]   or you're a pilot tenured of 20 years.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.620]   My understanding is every,
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.660]   at least of the major three American airline carriers
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.860]   offers you this buddy pass of some kind,
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:39.340]   where you can say, hey, my wife, my son, my friend,
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.220]   my quote friend that I met through a guy named Zach
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:47.740]   now has an ability to get consistently cheaper fares
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.300]   through like a special app
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.300]   that's for basically buddy pass holders.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.300]   And depending on the airline,
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.780]   also employees of the airline itself.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.540]   So sometimes these can be very significant
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.420]   and a lot of it depends on the routes you're flying,
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.980]   how flexible you are,
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:06.060]   but you need to basically be willing to be super last minute
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.260]   not ever have your flight confirmed
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:12.260]   until hours in advance, sometimes less, maximum one day.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.420]   That's like the best you can really ever ask for
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.500]   with most buddy passes.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.360]   Of course, there's exceptions when you talk about
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.820]   really senior employees at certain airlines,
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.320]   but very much this only makes sense for someone
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.220]   that wants to travel a lot and is like super flexible.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.060]   So when I think about people
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.860]   that have successfully had buddy passes,
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.540]   basically like all single people in their 20s.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.420]   So not that you have to be single in your 20s
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.980]   to live this type of lifestyle,
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.260]   but just something to keep in mind
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.700]   if that doesn't describe you
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.020]   and just know that the bar
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.620]   to actually really take advantage of this is high
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.580]   because the market price right now
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.540]   to broker a buddy pass is in the five figures.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.860]   So you have to be saying like, hey, listen,
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.560]   I was going to spend well over that in flights
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.340]   and I'm gonna accept the penalty
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.740]   of not having my flights confirmed
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.360]   and what that means for my life and planning.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.200]   And now it makes sense.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.580]   So you're really like, okay,
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.620]   I want to basically get tens of thousands of dollars
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.820]   worth of travel.
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.580]   This is when it makes sense to do this.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.040]   And before I talk about kind of the brokering part of it,
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.420]   you also don't need to like buy something brokered.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.340]   You could also just try to find someone
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.580]   that works for an airline
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:17.260]   and become really close with them.
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.580]   Obviously, you wouldn't want to do it just for that
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.880]   and you want to be transparent about like,
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.900]   hey, listen, this is something that's valuable for me.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.380]   I don't think you should go on LinkedIn
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.960]   and like look at everyone in your city
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.100]   that works for the airline,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.820]   go to some mixer or something.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.360]   But like, yeah, you might know people
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.620]   that work in this airline industry
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.460]   and you can even say like,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.820]   hey, listen, like someone using your buddy pass right now,
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.300]   for the most part, that's not gonna really be an option.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.140]   So there are people, and I'm not one of these brokers,
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.140]   but I just know many of the brokers
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.580]   where we offer to people that kind of ask us,
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.980]   it's not something that we like really advertise.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.700]   There's brokers that basically their job
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.340]   is knocking on doors,
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.380]   especially in parts of the world
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.420]   or parts of the states
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:57.260]   where what the person selling the buddy pass could get
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:00.300]   is pretty material to their lives in terms of cash.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:03.020]   Like, hey, listen, are you willing to do this?
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.180]   Can you follow these instructions
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.100]   to basically do a good job pertaining to the airline?
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.140]   This person's actually your friend
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.740]   or your like second cousin.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.820]   And then they go to other people and say,
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.300]   hey, listen, like we have these buddy passes,
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.640]   they have a reputation
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.820]   and they largely work on a referral basis.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.820]   So similar with kind of any old school brokerage industry,
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.740]   it's built off trust
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.580]   and built off being able to provide a valuable service,
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.740]   which right now this is like this thing that is given
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.860]   that there's not an ability to have liquidity
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.960]   for good reasons from the perspective of an airline,
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.860]   but both sides of the market want there to be liquidity.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.900]   So there's always gonna be a way
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.900]   that some people try to make that happen.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.860]   And this is one of the many examples of that
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.580]   that exists in the airline industry.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.300]   - I'm sure it matters depending on the airline,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.460]   even the tenure of the employee,
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.380]   but are these things hundreds of dollars,
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.220]   thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars?
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.660]   How should someone think about it?
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:56.940]   - I haven't seen a buddy pass
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.420]   go for less than 12 grand for years.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.060]   And that's like on the low end.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:06.380]   So yeah, if you want like a tenured pilot buddy pass,
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:10.260]   you're looking at at least like 18 or 20 grand annually.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.100]   It's a great thing
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.220]   because you can get $300,000 worth of flights for that,
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.620]   but like you have to actually wanna take $300,000
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.540]   worth of flights.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.460]   So that's makes sense.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.740]   - Are they in premium cabins
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.420]   or are you just subject to the same upgrade priority
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.780]   as anyone else or how does that work?
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.220]   - So this is where what buddy pass you buy comes into play.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.180]   So depending on the airline, depending on the alliance,
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.020]   you could have ones
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.100]   where you're at the same priority as everyone else,
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.540]   or you could have some ones
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.900]   where you're like closer to what a tenured pilot would get.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.580]   And that's why tenured pilot buddy passes
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.620]   go for significantly more in the market.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.140]   I've even seen ones, you know,
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.500]   that have gone for like as high as like 35 grand,
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.420]   but like you're basically getting a business class seat
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.260]   if it doesn't get sold normally.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.980]   So that's the benefit of buddy pass like that
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.900]   where kind of other buddy passes,
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.140]   you're basically never getting confirmed
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.820]   and you're often flying economy.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.820]   And even if you travel insane amount,
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.060]   you can't ever use the lounge.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.100]   So those are kind of the high and low
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.620]   end of the spectrum respectively.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.180]   - I will say I have heard stories of people
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.700]   who have found people directly
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.620]   and gotten buddy passes much less expensive
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.460]   than what you said,
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.460]   which it happens in any opaque market, right?
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.040]   It sounds like the market price,
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.100]   given how much value you can get from them
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.740]   is over $10,000.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.380]   But for someone who doesn't wanna go to a broker,
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.260]   the value is whatever anyone's willing to pay.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.940]   And if there aren't a lot of people,
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.380]   maybe you can get it for a few thousand dollars.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.940]   So I will say it could be worth the effort.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.860]   I have at least one friend I know who I met recently
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.540]   who got a, I think it was a Hawaiian Airlines
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:42.140]   or an Alaska Airlines buddy pass for well under $12,000.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:45.060]   I wanna say it was like much closer to a thousand dollars,
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.700]   but it only happened because they met someone
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.700]   and that person was like,
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.680]   maybe not even like totally aware of the fact
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.560]   that they had something worth much more,
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.480]   or maybe just kind of like a little scared
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.520]   to go into the whole world of like selling it to a broker
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.840]   and having an anonymous person
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.920]   and felt better with a friend.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.880]   And so if there- - Most people are.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.680]   - If you reduce the demand to, I just need a person,
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.700]   you could probably get a great deal.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.920]   So I'd say keep your eyes and your ears out there for that.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.720]   And if people are interested in this world,
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.240]   I think you told me when I asked
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.320]   if there was anything for listeners,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.560]   you said you could help give people access.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.000]   And then if any, all the Hacks members are interested,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.040]   we could try to help them get a discount on that.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.520]   So if that offer still stands,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.640]   your email is gonna be in the show notes.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.880]   I'm gonna, you're gonna get blown up.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.720]   - Definitely.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.960]   And yeah, I would say, listen,
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.440]   if you feel like you're like a good social networker person,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.860]   definitely try to do this.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.200]   And these are done annually.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.080]   So it's rare that you can actually buy one
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.640]   except like at the end of the year.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.200]   So you got a lot of time now,
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.880]   we're recording this at the end of January.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.360]   So like try to get it yourself.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.100]   And then if you absolutely want it for your 2025 travel,
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.920]   feel free to shoot me a message.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.240]   But like Chris said,
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.560]   there's definitely ways you can buy it from individuals
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.600]   at much lower than what the market price is.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.960]   It's not a big market.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   This is a much, much smaller market
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.280]   than those that are doing miles and points stuff,
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.080]   mainly because you have to be really careful.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.440]   And like anyone that's doing this,
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.040]   if you're putting someone as your second cousin,
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.920]   like you gotta like invent a backstory
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.160]   and you have to have like both sides
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.600]   of the party being okay with this.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.320]   And this is something where like, you know,
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.600]   a lot of people are not gonna be okay with doing that.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.680]   So when it's not just,
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.320]   hey, someone doesn't wanna work with a broker,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.840]   they also wanna lie to their employer
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.160]   and have their job go away.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.760]   So I think that's probably the bigger reason
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:21.600]   for a lot of this.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.800]   And I think that's very reasonable.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.780]   But if you meet a nice person at an event
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.960]   and they could help you with it,
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.360]   and you can say they're actually your friend
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.180]   and friends are allowed for the buddy pass,
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.460]   that's gonna feel very different
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.920]   even if functionally it's the same thing.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920]   - Okay, that's awesome.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.440]   I feel like we hit a lot, right?
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.980]   We went through miles and points.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.120]   We went through the hidden city arbitrage.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.520]   We went through VPNs.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.920]   We went through consolidators, travel agents,
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.960]   business programs,
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.360]   and then rounded off with these buddy passes.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.400]   Did I miss anything else?
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.720]   If you're trying to save money on flights,
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.600]   did we hit it all?
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.520]   - Credit cards.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.280]   So you've done a lot of episodes on this,
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.880]   but I think we should probably just hit it briefly at least
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.600]   because it is an important thing.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I totally, yeah.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.000]   I guess we overlooked that,
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.080]   but my general rule of thumb
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.360]   has actually been pretty straightforward.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.720]   I have a Platinum Amex.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.240]   I put all my flights on my Platinum Amex.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.000]   I get five X points.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.720]   If you're able to get at least two cents of value there,
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.120]   that's 10% off all flights.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   You know, I tell people the Platinum card,
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.880]   you got to spend enough, probably 10, 20, 30.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.720]   I think you'd send an email like 30 grand
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.920]   to make it worth it.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.080]   Really depends on how you value all the credits.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.160]   And there's a whole slew of challenges trying to figure out
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.760]   what makes a Platinum Amex worth it,
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.280]   but it should be pretty easy if that's not it.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.680]   There are plenty of cards that you'd earn three X points
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.840]   on flights in almost every card issuer.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.960]   - So I think for a lot of your listeners,
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.840]   the math on the Amex Platinum could make sense.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.040]   And probably for most,
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.440]   the math in the Chase software reserve makes sense.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.520]   And now you're just adding,
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.240]   depending on how much you value the points,
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.320]   somewhere between probably like a floor of 4 1/2%
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.160]   to maybe, you know, 10%, a little more than 10% back
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.680]   at the Amex Platinum if you're savvy with using your points.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.280]   So use those credit cards.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.960]   They stack well with everything.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.480]   That's the good news, except for the miles and points.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.520]   But if you're using miles and points,
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.080]   you're hopefully saving way more than 10% off retail.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.120]   - We forgot one important one here,
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.440]   which is card-linked offers.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.600]   So I would say pretty consistently with Amex,
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.480]   I haven't actually seen many on others.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:17.480]   I will see an offer for spend $300 on Delta, get $75 back.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.560]   More on the hotel than the flights,
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.640]   but I have certainly seen them on flights.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.520]   So to the extent you have travel lined up,
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.640]   I think that is one last final thing that I would say,
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.480]   take a look.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.800]   Sometimes that's the case.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.440]   And I haven't actually tried this,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.720]   but I wonder if that would work for gift cards, right?
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.840]   If you've got to spend 300 on Delta, get a hundred back,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.660]   and you don't have a Delta flight right now,
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.440]   could you buy $300 of Delta travel bank credit,
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.100]   gift cards, et cetera, get your hundred and then save it?
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.400]   I don't know why that just came to me,
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.520]   but I think as you were talking about credit cards,
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.800]   I was thinking about the Card Pointers app,
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.440]   which a friend of mine, Emmanuel, has built.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.880]   And it's a fantastic app for managing your cards,
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.840]   making sure you have them in the right category.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.440]   But the killer feature of the pro version
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.160]   is that they will auto enroll you
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.840]   in all the card-linked offers.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.400]   And not just the hundred you see, all of them,
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.640]   and not just all of them,
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.760]   but all of them on all of your cards at the same time.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.360]   So you can often enroll in the same offer on multiple cards,
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.000]   which you can't do manually.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.800]   But it turns out if you hit the Amex API and website
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.580]   at the exact same time for all your cards,
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.580]   you can enroll them on multiple cards.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.680]   So he's been generous enough to give all listeners
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.800]   a great deal at allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.380]   But it's a great app that I know I constantly see
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.760]   people getting way more value out of.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.040]   It's even 50% off if you're an All The Hacks member.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.160]   So a couple of cool member deals to share,
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.320]   but that's one thing the card-linked offers that I've seen,
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.320]   which we didn't cover.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.160]   Oh, the only other thing that you didn't mention
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.000]   is that you sent me this really cool
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.600]   points optimization plan.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.560]   I'll link to it in the show notes
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.040]   if people wanna take a look at it.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.280]   It's a product you guys build
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.240]   where you basically fully prepare
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.120]   and help people run their points strategy.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.000]   So I know you offered a discount
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.040]   to All The Hacks members for that as well.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.360]   But I'll link that if anyone's interested
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.280]   in what something like that would look like.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.920]   'Cause I just found it fascinating.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.360]   If someone made it this far
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.880]   and doesn't feel like they're gonna save money
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.720]   on the next flight, maybe you weren't listening,
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.800]   or I apologize we did our jobs poorly,
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.080]   but I feel very confident that the average person listening
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.740]   is gonna be saving a lot of money.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.580]   This is awesome.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:16.080]   We talked about what you guys do at FlyFlat.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.280]   We're gonna link to the show notes.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.840]   Allthehacks.com/flyflat is a site
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.600]   where you will generously be giving people a discount
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.760]   if they book flights.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.620]   Any other places you wanna send people before we wrap?
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:27.720]   - Yeah, I think the other place
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.040]   is just for our beta product.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.240]   I know you have a lot of listeners that are in tech
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.880]   and would love any feedback as well.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.580]   But yeah, if you go to fly-flat.com/deals,
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.320]   we're allowing a few of our best mileage inventory
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.720]   to be booked instantly.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.680]   Especially if you live in New York, that's live today,
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.680]   and we'll have other cities live in the next few months
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.220]   and would love your feedback
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.740]   and any thoughts you have there.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.040]   But yeah, Chris, thank you so much
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.540]   for having me on the podcast today.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.920]   I really, really enjoyed it,
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.440]   and I'm excited to see what this resource looks like
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.440]   for just comprehensively how to save money on flights.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.120]   - Yes, I'm excited to go book another flight
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.480]   'cause I feel like even I have a few tips.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.320]   So thank you so much for joining me.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.640]   I look forward to hearing what people do
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   and how much they save.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.680]   - Thanks, Chris.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.840]   - That was awesome.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.360]   I consider myself pretty advanced
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.160]   when it comes to saving money on travel,
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.160]   but I definitely picked up a few tricks
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.760]   and I hope you did too.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.020]   As always, thank you so much for listening.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.360]   And I have a new request today
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.400]   for whatever podcast app you're in,
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.880]   and especially if it's Apple Podcasts.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   Since Apple's charts and rankings are the most widely used,
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.920]   could you please go ahead
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.480]   and click that follow or subscribe button?
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.800]   I'm actually gonna start releasing a few extra episodes
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.000]   on days other than Wednesday,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.600]   so I definitely don't want you to miss out on those either.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.960]   Finally, if you have any feedback or wanna get in touch
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.840]   or share a question you have for a future mailbag episode,
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.360]   you can email me at podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   That's it for this week.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.480]   I will see you next week.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:54.960]   I wanna tell you about another podcast I love
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.260]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.920]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.080]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.240]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.120]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.360]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.280]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.240]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.440]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.100]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.560]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.400]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.460]   but recently I listened to an episode
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.720]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.960]   that will blow your mind.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.820]   And it was so crazy to learn things
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.800]   like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.720]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.400]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.040]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.740]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.640]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.000]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.680]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.400]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
