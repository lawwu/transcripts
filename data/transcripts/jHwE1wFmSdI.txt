[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.960]   Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 8 and reading again verse 18, the 18th verse
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.480]   in the 8th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.720]   "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.120]   with the glory which shall be revealed in us."
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.600]   I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.160]   glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.680]   Now we've been considering the last two Sunday mornings and we're considering again this
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.720]   morning why it is that the Christian Church and ourselves as individual members of the
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.640]   Christian Church are to be found as we are.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   When you think of the Church in general, you cannot but be struck and hit by her ineffectiveness,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.000]   by the way in which she doesn't count as once she did count, and that in spite of all
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   the efforts that are made and have been made in order to change and improve the situation,
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.160]   in spite of all the activities of men.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.760]   Indeed, I think it can be granted quite fairly and honestly that the Church in many ways
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.160]   has never been more active than she is at the present time.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.000]   Men have never been so busy, so zealous, and have never tried so much by means of various
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.320]   organizations to retrieve the situation.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.280]   And yet we find that in spite of that the position far from improving deteriorates and
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.440]   goes from bad to worse.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   Now the great question is why is this?
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.200]   Or if you take it in the more personal sense, why is it that we find a contrast so often
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.760]   between the typical, average, modern Christian and what we read of the Christian here in
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   the New Testament, or what we can read of the Christian in various periods in the history
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.280]   of the Church, or what you can read in the biographies of God's people in times past?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.560]   Not only the well-known and outstanding people, but even the lives of ordinary, so-called
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.880]   ordinary Christian people, ordinary members of the Christian Church.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.080]   Now this, it seems to me, is the major problem of the present time.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.880]   There must be something wrong somewhere.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.140]   There must be something radically wrong in our whole approach.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.660]   The Church has been aware of all this, of course.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.920]   And as I say, she has been busy, she is still being busy.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.440]   It's the thing that's behind the ecumenical movement.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.560]   It's the thing that's behind evangelistic campaigns and all these activities.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   It's an attempt to restore the Church.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.480]   But as I say, we are face to face with the fact that it doesn't seem to be succeeding.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   And why not?
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.660]   I'm suggesting, and have suggested for the last two Sunday mornings, that the real trouble
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.860]   is that we are ignoring almost entirely the one thing that matters, the one thing that
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.340]   counts.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.940]   And that is our relationship to God.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.560]   This is astonishing.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.380]   The whole business of the Gospel is to bring us into relationship with God.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.020]   But the tragedy is that we tend to stop at blessings received instead of the relationship
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020]   itself.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.860]   And the result is that we are missing the greatest, the most wonderful, the most glorious
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.860]   thing of all.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.340]   While we are busying ourselves with lesser things, we are forgetting and ignoring the
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.420]   real thing that we are offered in the Scriptures above everything else.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.700]   Now we've been looking at this.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.020]   We spent our first Sunday morning in looking at the possibility of the realization of the
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.900]   presence and of the glory of God.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.540]   That's the supreme end of all religion, all Christianity, that we might come into an immediate
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.180]   and personal knowledge of God, not merely to believe things about him.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.860]   Christ died to bring us to God, to bring us into that intimate, personal knowledge.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.100]   And this is something that is possible for us.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.700]   You find it in the Old Testament as well as in the New.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.020]   You get those appearances of God to men.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.780]   Think of Abram, think of many others, Jacob, Peniel, and all the Bethel, and with the Amanda
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.260]   Peniel, these various illustrations.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.300]   We looked at the longing of the psalmist for this, and how grieved he is when he can't
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.420]   be there, when he was unable to go to the house of God to worship.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.180]   As he tells us in the 84th Psalm, his main trouble was not that he couldn't meet with
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.980]   his fellow believers.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.540]   It wasn't that he was missing the services.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.060]   It was that he was missing something of the grace and the glory of God, which he had so
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.380]   often seen and enjoyed in the tabernacle.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.380]   And that is a theme that runs right through the Old Testament.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.780]   God is pleased by these visions, manifestations, theophanies.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.940]   There's a great variety of ways in which God made it clear, even under the Old Testament
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.980]   dispensation, that he was pleased that men and women should come into immediate contact
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:53.740]   with him and should worship him as the living God and have access into his very presence.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.820]   But the New Testament, of course, is still clearer on this very matter.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.380]   It's made still more plain.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.820]   And in our Lord we have this in greater fullness.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.940]   And in the coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and all that that involves,
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:18.140]   we are taught to look to and to enjoy this great and wonderful possibility that has been
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.580]   laid open to us.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.260]   Now that was the first thing we considered.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.940]   And then we went on last Sunday to show how this in turn leads to something of this glory
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.340]   in us.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.260]   We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.460]   same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.180]   That's 2 Corinthians 3 18.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.860]   In other words, there seems to be a failure on our part to realize that we're meant to
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.020]   enjoy God.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.940]   The chief end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.060]   And likewise we tend to forget that we are to be such that men and women see something
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.820]   of this glory in us.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.740]   Now I was emphasizing, trying to emphasize last Sunday, that this is ultimately to me
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.980]   at Inuit the way of evangelism.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.100]   It is when the world sees something in and about Christian people which amazes them and
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:29.200]   astonishes them and fills them with a sense of longing that they really will truly begin
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.060]   to listen to this gospel.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.180]   This is not to disparage any individual work that may be taking place.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.260]   Thank God for every individual conversion.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.140]   I'm talking about the whole state of this country and of the world.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.980]   And I'm here to suggest what the history of the church shows so plainly and clearly, that
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:54.700]   it is only when you get some striking signal, outstanding manifestation of the glory and
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:03.540]   the power of God in what we call revival, that a community, that a nation can be convicted
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.380]   and turned to God.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:12.660]   Now this has happened so often in the past and God remains still the same.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.420]   It is because we know so little about the manifestation of God's glory that we try to
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:23.500]   do his work for him and talk about turning cities upside down for God.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.300]   The answer is it is only God who can turn cities upside down.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.480]   Men can't turn cities upside down.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:35.620]   It is God who turns cities upside down in the world and he does so by the manifestation
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.380]   of the glory of his power.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.540]   Now this is the thing, it seems to me, that we're all tending to forget in our preoccupation
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.860]   with ourselves and our own activities, but it will lead to nothing.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.260]   It never can.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.700]   The glory is God's and he will not give his glory to anybody else.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:01.820]   So we see that we must learn more about this glory and we must learn more about the glory
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.580]   that should be manifest in us and through us and so have its impact upon society at
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.780]   large.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.260]   We must realize our privileges and our responsibilities anew and afresh.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.560]   But there's another thing I want to advert to this morning, which is a continuation of
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.960]   all that we've been considering.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.180]   You remember how that verse put it to Corinthians 3, 18.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.140]   We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord have changed into the
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.380]   same image from glory to glory.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:43.380]   Now there is a suggestion of a progression and it is meant to be true.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:50.380]   We all of us should know more and more increasingly as the year passes year of this glory and
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:56.280]   more and more of this glory should be evident and manifest in us.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.880]   If people are not growing in the Christian life, there is something seriously wrong.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.060]   If people have to go on talking all through their lives about their conversion and have
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.900]   got nothing else to say, well it seems to me to be a complete denial of this teaching.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.700]   But there are many such.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.260]   That's all they seem to have had by way of experience, their conversion.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.740]   And they spent the rest of their lives in repeating that story.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.220]   Don't you know more and more about this glory?
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.420]   Are you not advancing from glory to glory?
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.420]   We are to grow.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.140]   These are the images that are used in the New Testament.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.060]   Babes, children, young men, old men, there is to be growth and development.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.860]   If our whole idea of the Christian life is not much more wonderful today than it was
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.220]   a year ago or ten years ago, well it is a very sad thing indeed and there is something
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.020]   hopelessly wrong.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:55.180]   Surely the greatest need today is not so much the need of evangelism primarily as the need
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.580]   of the revival of the church, the production of a people who shall progressively and increasingly
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:10.060]   be showing the glory of God and causing men and women to examine themselves and to hunger
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.340]   and to thirst for the same thing.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:19.260]   But now I am saying that there is this progression, this advance, this development, and obviously
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.740]   that is leading to an end.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.460]   And the end is the thing I am now referring to and dealing with.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.900]   And that is our final glorification.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.900]   That is the thing.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.020]   And here it is put very plainly before us.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.380]   I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.100]   glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.740]   Now he has already said it in the seventeenth verse.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.220]   He has reminded them that the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.780]   the children of God.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:02.500]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:12.440]   If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:20.180]   Now this you see is the goal and the end and the object of the whole of the Christian message.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:27.100]   And the apostle, as you realize, is here writing to these Roman Christians in order to encourage
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.740]   them.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.420]   This world has never been an easy place for Christian people.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.440]   It's never been an easy place for the Christian church.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:42.500]   They were being subjected then to misunderstanding and persecution and all sorts of trials and
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   of tribulations.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.580]   He talks about the sufferings of this present time.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.620]   The church finds herself in difficulties.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.260]   She's a minority always in the world.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.300]   But how does she, what does she do about it?
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.100]   What is his advice to them?
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.380]   What are they to do?
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.180]   Well this is ultimately the only consolation that is offered the Christian.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:13.140]   This indeed is the incitement and the inducement that is always held before the Christian.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.300]   Don't look at what's happening to you, sufferings of this present time.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:24.060]   You keep your eye on this glory which is coming to you and for you.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:31.220]   Now I could give you endless quotations to establish this point.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.620]   Take for instance Paul's summary of the benefits that we derive in and through our
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.020]   blessed Lord and Savior in 1 Corinthians 1.30.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:48.860]   But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.300]   and sanctification and redemption.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   What does redemption mean?
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.620]   Well that means the glorification.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.100]   That is ultimate glorification.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:10.180]   And this is again something which we so constantly tend to forget, that we are destined for this
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.980]   state and condition of glory.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:20.380]   Sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.420]   be revealed in us.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.420]   This is a great theme running right through the whole of the Bible and again in particular
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.980]   of course in the New Testament where the thing is brought right home to us and we see the
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:38.860]   possibility in what happened to our blessed Lord and Savior who as we are reminded in
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.700]   this chapter is the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:52.660]   Now I wonder how often we think about this and contemplate this amazing thing that is
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.100]   held here before us.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.100]   What does it mean?
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.900]   What does it mean by talking about the glory which shall be revealed in us?
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.900]   Our glorification.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.900]   Well, a hurried definition would include something like this.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:18.180]   It means our final and complete deliverance from all the effects and the results of sin
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.260]   and of the fall.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:26.100]   We were dealing last Sunday morning with the fall and what it has done to us and how even
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:32.500]   in this present life in this present world we are delivered from so many and so much
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.220]   of the consequences of the fall.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.700]   That's the glory that comes into us, the glory in which we are being changed from glory
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:47.940]   to glory, the new image, the image restored, the image of God's Son.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.860]   But here we are taken beyond it.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:57.660]   We recognize that in this life and in this world it is not complete, it is not perfect,
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.660]   it is not final.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.900]   You see the apostle puts it here in the 23rd verse.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:09.300]   He talks about the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain together until now.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:18.180]   And then he says, "Not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:26.460]   Even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.460]   our body."
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.140]   It isn't perfect yet.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.300]   We don't arrive at a stage of finality in this life and in this world.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.620]   We are being changed from glory to glory.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:45.800]   It is progressive, it is advancing, but we never arrive at a state of complete perfection.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:54.180]   But the promise is that eventually it shall be complete and perfect and in time.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:01.700]   All the effects of sin shall be nullified and completely undone.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:07.740]   Our Lord, we are told, in many places came into the world in order to undo, to nullify,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.860]   to disintegrate all the works of the devil.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.820]   And he does so, and he will do so, in every single respect.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.780]   Now first of all, of course, this is something that happens to us in the realm of the soul
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.020]   and the spirit that must come first, always must have priority.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.360]   And indeed this is what is wonderful.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.860]   This is what happens most of all in this life and in this world.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.140]   We are restored to communion with God.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.220]   That's a spiritual result.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.980]   Sin cuts us off from that.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.980]   Salvation restores.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:51.380]   It's a part of this glorification which begins in us, even in this present life and world.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.220]   Those privileges that we enjoy, which we considered hurriedly last Sunday.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.100]   Now that, I say, is going to be carried to the state of perfection.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.940]   The apostle puts it like this, for instance, in writing to the Ephesians.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:13.420]   In dealing with the question of the relationship between husbands and wives in Ephesians 5,
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.860]   he says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:25.860]   for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word."
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.860]   What for?
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.860]   Here's the object.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:36.780]   "That he might present it to himself a glorious church," which means a glorified church, "not
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:46.340]   having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish."
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:52.620]   Now that's a very wonderful statement of this spiritual perfection to which the church
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:19:00.380]   is going to come and to which we are to come as individual members of the church.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:07.380]   Neither spot nor wrinkle nor any such thing, holy and without blemish.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.940]   All the things that sin and evil and the fall have done to us, they are to be completely
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   cancelled.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:20.620]   Here and now, they are being cancelled, but still a certain amount of the taint remains.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:27.420]   You see, we've got to differentiate between the various aspects of sin.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.140]   Sin produces guilt.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.540]   Sin produces slavery.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   But sin also produces pollution.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.840]   We are already delivered from the guilt of sin.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.340]   You can never be more delivered from the guilt of your sin than you are now if you're a Christian
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.640]   and if you're a believer truly in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.300]   If you really do believe in his broken body and his shed blood, if you believe in all
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:58.500]   that is represented by this communion table, well then I'm free to say and I'm given authority
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.460]   to say that you are as delivered now from the guilt of your sin as you ever can be.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.620]   Even in heaven, you'll not be more free from the guilt of sin than you are now.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.620]   What's happened?
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.340]   You have been justified.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.660]   More happy, but not more secure.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.700]   The glorified spirits in heaven, as Top Lady reminds us.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.020]   Now that is something that has been done once and forever.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.900]   What about the power of sin?
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.500]   The fall puts us under the power of sin.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.940]   Well, I say that is something again that has started.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.460]   There is a deliverance already from the power of sin, but it's not complete.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.400]   This is one of the progressive things.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:49.220]   We are being delivered from the power of sin and should be conscious of it more and more,
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.860]   but still more serious is the pollution of sin.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.300]   And this is something that has been so sadly neglected.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:05.020]   We've been taught so much in terms of particular sins and particular failures and taught so
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.580]   much about power that we've forgotten the thing that is most serious of all, which is
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.040]   the pollution of sin.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.100]   It has polluted the whole of our nature.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.700]   Now this again, thank God, is something that has already started.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.500]   It's a part of the glory that is ours now.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:27.660]   The Spirit in us, working in us, as the Apostle teaches here and elsewhere.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.700]   The Spirit leading us and so on.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.260]   And the work of the Spirit in sanctification.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:38.540]   He is cleansing us, this washing, this cleansing and purification.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   That's progressive.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:45.340]   But that again is something that is never complete in this world and in this life.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.980]   There is no such thing as sinless perfection.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:54.180]   And even sects that have taught that have often given us the most glaring demonstrations
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.340]   of the fact that it is simply not true.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:03.180]   No, no, this is something progressive, but it will be absolutely perfect.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.780]   But this glorification affects not only the soul and the Spirit.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:16.420]   You notice how in this very context we are reminded that it applies also to the body.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.900]   The body still bears the results of sin and the fall.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:27.180]   Weakness, frailty, illness, disease, all the things that we know of.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.020]   The body can so often be a burden.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.700]   The body has suffered.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.900]   And you see, this is a really wonderful thing.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:41.660]   A part of our ultimate salvation, a part of our glorification, includes the complete emancipation
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.140]   even of the body from the effects and the ravages of sin.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:53.260]   Not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:23:03.620]   Even we ourselves grow within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to which that is the redemption
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.620]   of our body.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.980]   It is going to happen.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.820]   We shall be in glorified bodies.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.540]   Salvation does not apply only to the soul and to the Spirit.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.700]   It includes the body also.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:23.100]   That is why we must always insist upon a literal, physical resurrection.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.620]   We are not going to be disembodied spirits.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.980]   We are going to be in glorified bodies.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.660]   Listen again to Paul in Philippians 3 at the end.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:37.900]   Our conversation, our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:45.140]   From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:53.860]   vile body, the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:24:01.100]   body, that it may be made like unto, conformable to, the body of his glorification, according
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:07.100]   to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:13.860]   Now there are glorious statements about the glorification of the body.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:19.660]   Now you remember how after our Lord's resurrection we are told something about his appearances
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.660]   to his church and witnesses.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.780]   And it is quite clear that his body had undergone this process of glorification.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.140]   He could come into a room with all the doors shut.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.700]   He suddenly appeared and they thought at first that he was a spirit.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.740]   He says no, a spirit, he says, has not got flesh and bones as you see me have.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.940]   And so he eats in their presence.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.100]   It was a body and yet it was different.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.860]   They didn't recognize, they couldn't understand.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.820]   That's the body of his glorification.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:58.540]   And what we are told there is that our bodies shall be glorified in that kind of way.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:03.220]   We shall have glorified bodies as well as souls and spirits.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:12.060]   In other words, the whole man shall be entirely delivered and emancipated from all the consequences
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.460]   and the ravages of sin.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.340]   Now the Christian people, I want to put a question to you.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.500]   You notice how Paul puts that in at the end of Philippians 3 there.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:27.540]   He says our citizenship is in him.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.580]   Do we think about that?
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.700]   Are we conscious of that?
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:37.100]   Are we living as men and women to whom that is the most wonderful and the glorious reality
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.740]   and fact of all?
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.580]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.820]   That's where we belong.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.340]   That's our home.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.780]   That's the empire to which we belong.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:59.620]   But then you notice he goes on to say from whence also we look for, we expect the Savior.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.900]   You see this is the thing that runs right through the New Testament, this great hope.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.900]   And they're all being exalted always to look to this.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.660]   This you see is the final answer to all the problems in the church and in the world, his
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.660]   coming.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:21.460]   And when he comes that is what he'll do to our bodies and so we shall be entirely
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.740]   emancipated and delivered from all the effects and the results of sin.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.580]   Let me give you another way of looking at this glorification.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.580]   These things are so wonderful.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.340]   Do we live by these things?
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.140]   My dear friends, don't you think the trouble with the church is today we are all so busy
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.100]   we are missing the glory.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:48.460]   The glory of his presence, the glory that should be in us, the glory for which we are
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.220]   being prepared.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.140]   These are the great notes of the New Testament teaching.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.860]   Where have they gone?
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.500]   Why is the church not interested in these things as she once was and as she should be?
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:07.420]   I say again there is no hope until God's people return to these things and then there
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.540]   will be many festers of the glory.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.860]   But look at it as I say, as John puts it in his first epistle in the third chapter in
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:21.900]   the first two verses, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:27.980]   that we should be called the sons of God.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.460]   Therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew not him."
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.060]   Beloved, now are we the sons of God?
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.900]   I want to emphasize that again.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:46.300]   If you were a Christian, you are a son of God and you can never be more a son of God
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.300]   than you are now.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.740]   There again is one of those things that has happened once and for all.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.580]   You are given a new birth once and once only.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   That is why there is no such thing as falling from grace.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.420]   You can't be born again today and sin out of it tomorrow and be born again.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:09.580]   All this idea that you can come in and out of the Christian life and that you can constantly
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.460]   fall away from grace, it's not only a denial of the gospel, it detracts from the glory
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.820]   of God's great and wonderful salvation.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.500]   It is God through the Spirit that gives us the rebirth.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:29.700]   Once you are born again as a son and a child of God, well you are, now are we, the sons
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.780]   of God.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.260]   And you'll never be more of a son than you are now.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.660]   The prodigal son, you know, in the far country was still a son of his father.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.100]   He was no lesser son than when he was at home.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.940]   He was no lesser son than his elder brother.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.620]   The elder brother didn't understand that like so many today who go wrong in their doctrine
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.780]   at that point.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.020]   He thought that because his brother had misbehaved he'd cease to be a son.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.060]   That was his cardinal error.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.900]   And people who talk about you being able to sin out of sonship are just denying the essence
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.100]   of this doctrine.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.500]   We are the sons of God.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.420]   And you can't add to that, but there is something you can add to.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.220]   Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.340]   And it does not yet appear what we shall be.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.760]   Now you see, there's the difference.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.820]   We are, we shall be.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.180]   We are sons of God.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.780]   We shall always be sons of God.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.380]   There's no change there, but there is a change here.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:32.900]   It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.980]   be like him.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:41.180]   For we shall see him as he is.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:47.260]   Now if you can tell me of anything that goes beyond that, I'd like to hear of it.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.420]   There is nothing beyond that.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.760]   This is Christian salvation.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:58.820]   Why do people stop only at forgiveness of sins and deliverance from particular sins
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.900]   and power?
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.820]   Why don't they talk about this?
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.060]   This is essential Christianity.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.740]   This is the glory of Christianity.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.300]   Why are we always so subjective and always looking at ourselves?
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.260]   I want this, I want that, and then the teaching will come along.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.820]   You can get it like this and that.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.180]   Oh, my dear friends, let's lift up our eyes.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.860]   Let's look to the glory.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:28.700]   It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:36.460]   be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.920]   That's glorification.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.300]   We shall be like him, like him in nature.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.700]   We are already, but then completely delivered from all the pollution of sin, like him in
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.820]   our very bodies, like unto the body of his glorification.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:59.860]   We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.860]   What else?
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:05.780]   Well, the other great thing, of course, about this state of glorification is, as we are
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.940]   reminded here again in the context, that we shall reign with him.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:16.780]   If children, then heirs, heirs of God and joined heirs with Christ, if so be that we
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:26.660]   suffer with him now, that we shall be also glorified together.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.740]   And that, you see, leads on to this great question of reigning with him.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.540]   You remember how Paul puts it to the Corinthians.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.860]   This you see is the way in which the apostles deal with problems.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:46.340]   Here in 1 Corinthians 6, Paul is dealing with what appears to be a most mundane, and indeed
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.300]   almost mercenary problem.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:54.500]   "Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the young just and
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.740]   not before the saints?"
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.260]   In other words, in the church of Corinth, there were disputes between certain members,
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.620]   perhaps about a bit of property, something someone had sold to another, we don't know
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.660]   what it was, but there was some disagreement and some difference and they were tending
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.180]   to quarrel, and indeed they were going to law with one another.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.220]   "Go to law before the unjust."
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.740]   Now, the apostle is dealing with this.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   Do you know how he deals with it?
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.940]   This is New Testament Christianity.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:32.100]   "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:37.820]   And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.140]   And know ye not that we shall judge angels?"
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.100]   How much more things that pertain to this life.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.100]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.900]   That's how he deals with a little problem like that, a trumpery problem like that.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.180]   He lifts it up and says, "Look here, don't you realize who and what you are?
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.140]   You're behaving as if you didn't know what a Christian is.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.260]   You're behaving like worldly people.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.100]   Don't you know that you are going to judge the world?
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.540]   Don't you know that you are going to judge angels?"
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.940]   He reminds them of what they're destined for, this process they're going through now.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.260]   But it's to end in that.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.700]   So then he says, "Live here in the light of that."
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:20.580]   This is the thing that is to govern your immediate conduct, even in matters of detail such as
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   this.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.580]   Now that's New Testament.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.580]   Or again, take the apostle putting it in his second epistle to Timothy.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.300]   You've got exactly the same teaching.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.820]   To Timothy 2 and in verse 11 and 12.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:39.420]   "It is a faithful saying," he says, "for if we be dead with him, that we shall also
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.820]   live with him."
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:46.700]   If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.580]   If we deny him, he also will deny us.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.620]   But here's the thing.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:57.300]   If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.320]   This is a part of our glorification.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:07.180]   And I say once more that there is nothing more amazing and astounding than this.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.860]   Now my friends, these things are very practical as I've shown you.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.620]   The apostle in dealing with that little question of quarreling over things in the church at
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.180]   Corinth answers it in this way.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:23.940]   Do you answer yourself and your various problems in that way?
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:30.840]   Do you answer the problem of your personal unhappiness by reminding yourself of this?
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.940]   Do you answer the problem of other people dealing with you unkindly in the light of
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.940]   this?
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.340]   Do you answer the question, "If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him?"
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.940]   He was dealt with like that.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.060]   And the answer is, you don't look at that but you look at this glory which is coming
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.100]   and you are reigning with him.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.640]   This is the solution to all our problems.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.580]   In other words, we don't just sit back and wait for some experience or go to a meeting
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.980]   hoping to get some sensation.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   No, no.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.580]   That's not the way.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:01.220]   You do it in the light of this teaching and this doctrine.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.220]   Very well.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:08.940]   I'll give you a very hurried glimpse there into the ultimate of our salvation.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.740]   Here is what we are offered in the New Testament.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:25.020]   We are offered to realize and experience the glory, the glorious presence of God.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.540]   We are meant to enjoy God in this life and in this world.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:35.340]   Not worship a God who is away in the distance, not as it were speak to ourselves, though
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.140]   we think we are praying to God.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.840]   It must be a living, a real, a conscious communion.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.460]   We are to be changed from glory to glory.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:51.400]   We are to realize that the glory is going to be final and complete with nothing lacking
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.820]   at all, no spot, no wrinkle, nor any such thing.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:05.740]   Entire and absolutely perfect, holy and without any blemish in any part of our being whatsoever.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:11.260]   And the whole cosmos will be in the same state and condition.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.380]   Well now then, the vital question for me to bring these series of meditations to a close
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.540]   is this.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.900]   Are we realizing this?
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.660]   And if not, what are we to do about it?
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:30.940]   I say again, there is nothing that is more urgently important than this.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.780]   If Christian people for a while only stop thinking of those who are outside.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.020]   Now I don't mean by that that we stop doing anything about them, I don't.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.140]   I mean go on doing that, but I do mean this.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.700]   Give more thought to yourself and your own state and condition.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.960]   I'll put it to you like this again.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.740]   Why are the masses of the people outside?
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.160]   That's the basic question.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.780]   Why are they utterly indifferent to the Christian faith?
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.040]   Now I say there is only one answer to that question.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.180]   It is this.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:10.620]   That you and I are completely failing to give them the impression of the glory of this life.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:16.580]   If we do that, they'll immediately be interested, as they have always been.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.700]   And I am convinced that nothing else will attract them.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.420]   Unless they see, now I'm simply giving you the account of what has always happened in
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.360]   every period of revival.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.180]   You can read the histories for yourself.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.080]   There have been times, such as the present time in the history of the church, many, many
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.520]   times before, when things have been dead and lifeless, and the masses of the people have
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.460]   been completely indifferent.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.500]   Think of 200 years ago and more.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.280]   London was as godless then almost as it is today, and the churches were empty.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   What happened?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.260]   Well, when what happened to Whitefield and to Wesley took place, when these men were
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:00.540]   filled with the spirit of God, baptized with the spirit, and became aware of the glory
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.180]   of God in their personal lives, their preaching was transformed, and what happened?
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.980]   Well, wherever Whitefield went, people began crowding the churches.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   Why?
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.580]   Well, because of the manifestation of the glory of God.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.500]   You remember the first time he preached in his own home city of Gloucester, his very
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.940]   first sermon in his hometown.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:25.420]   There were such manifestations of the glory of God through that man and his preaching,
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.940]   that it was reported that 16 people had been driven mad, and there was a great excitement
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.660]   so that whenever he appeared, everybody crowded the place.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.580]   And the same happened in London.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.900]   Once the glory of God is manifested, the world outside says there's something in this after
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.900]   all.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.900]   I see things happening to people.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.620]   I see their lives.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.060]   There's something about them.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.780]   Something happens in their services, and they come crowding in.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.780]   You don't have to spend a hipney on advertising.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.540]   Revival advertises itself.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.460]   The glory of God in the midst of his people always acts as a magnet.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.300]   Out of sheer curiosity, they'll come.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.540]   And so the work goes on.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.040]   Now I am asking, what do we do therefore?
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:11.780]   This is the way that God's work is done, not by human effort, but by the manifestation
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:19.220]   of God's own glory and God's own power in and through his own people, individuals, preachers,
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   collections, churches, all these things.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:27.380]   Very well, what is our supreme duty at this time?
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.100]   What is the first and greatest call that comes to us?
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.220]   Well, I would summarize them like this.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.900]   The first thing is this.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:39.220]   We've got to realize the possibility of all this.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.780]   We've got to make ourselves realize the possibility.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:50.340]   We've become so accustomed to our type of service and other human efforts and organizations
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.660]   the same way.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.300]   We've seen it all before, and we'll see it again.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.260]   And we don't expect anything different.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:03.060]   My dear friends, we've got to begin to realize that God comes in amongst his people, that
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:09.140]   God is ready to manifest himself and his glory, that he breaks in upon the people.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.220]   The Bible's full of this.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.980]   I've reminded you of the theophanies and the appearances.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.580]   I've told you of the day of Pentecost, how he came.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:22.100]   There was no question it was God, and he's done this throughout the centuries to individuals
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.260]   and to collections of people, to churches.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:30.540]   And we must realize this possibility, the fact that this is 1960-something.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.500]   It is entirely immaterial.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.820]   It doesn't make any difference at all.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.460]   God doesn't change.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:43.540]   And we must realize that it is as possible for us to realize the presence of the living
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:49.380]   God, to know about this glory in him and in ourselves.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.380]   And this progressively, we must realize the possibility.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.660]   Are we expecting anything from God?
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.340]   It seems to me that we're not, that the church is not expecting from God.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.340]   She's expecting from men, from individuals.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.140]   We are relying upon ourselves and our own efforts.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.380]   The church is not expecting from God.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:15.020]   Because if you expect from God, you won't expect something to happen in about a year.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.360]   You'd expect it to happen now, or next moment, tomorrow, next Sunday.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.620]   If it's God, it can happen at any moment.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.080]   But if it's men, well, it depends upon a man's program and agenda and upon his diary.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.540]   You see, we are not looking to God.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.020]   And that is why things are as they are, my dear friends.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:38.620]   We must learn to look to God again and realize the possibility of the manifestation of his
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:44.020]   glory amongst his people, as in ancient times, so today.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.020]   What else?
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:52.260]   Well, we must believe more than ever in all that God has done for us in his dear and blessed
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.260]   Son.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:59.940]   You see, in the Old Testament, these manifestations of God's glory were external in a sense.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.580]   In the Shekinah glory, in the tabernacle, in the temple, the manifestations.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.260]   But now, how does it happen?
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.260]   Like this.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:13.700]   "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:23.620]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.540]   That's how he has now done it.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:31.220]   He has come in the person of his Son, who could say, "He who hath seen me hath seen
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.020]   the Father."
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.460]   So we look to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.700]   He's brought it all to us.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:47.140]   In the face of Jesus Christ, we look at him and we refrain from doing what he himself
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140]   said.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:54.900]   He said, you remember, on one occasion, "How can you believe which receive glory from one
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:00.620]   another, and seek not the glory that cometh from God only?"
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.940]   John 5, verse 44.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.940]   Isn't that the whole trouble?
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:09.340]   We are always receiving glory from one another, and we don't seek that glory that comes from
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.340]   God alone.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.100]   And that is the glory that comes in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.100]   What else?
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:23.540]   Well, we must submit entirely to the work of the Holy Spirit within us.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:28.100]   We all, with open face beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:36.220]   same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:42.020]   The Spirit has been sent to do this, to enlighten us, open our understanding.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.900]   They are the sons of God, we are told, who are led by the Spirit of God.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:53.540]   For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.540]   Let him lead you.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.580]   He is in us, he works in us.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.820]   Let him lead you.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.020]   He will lead you to the Son.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.700]   He was sent, what for?
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.040]   To glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.420]   He shall not speak as of himself, he shall glorify me.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:15.460]   He is given to us that the Son of God may be glorified in us and to us, manifested to
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.420]   us and we change progressively into his image.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:26.900]   So we must submit ourselves to the promptings and the leadings of the Spirit.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.780]   Give him time, give him opportunity.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.020]   Don't rush to make your plans and then ask for his blessing.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.420]   Let him guide you into the right plans.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.100]   Let him lead you, let him prompt you, let him urge you.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.180]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.860]   You just don't call him in after you've arranged everything.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.980]   No, no, it's the other way around.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.220]   You start with him, submit yourself to him and allow yourself to be led.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.220]   What else?
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.100]   Well, it's this great word, beholding.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:06.060]   We all behold him as in a glass, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.740]   How do we do this?
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.460]   Well, you see, it takes time.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.980]   I am convinced that the main trouble with most of us, even as Christians at the present
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:23.100]   time, is that we are frittering our energies away in over activities.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.500]   Take time to be holy.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.380]   Beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.700]   Now, I should be misunderstood for what I've said.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.620]   People say that I've said do nothing and some people will do nothing.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.620]   That's all wrong.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.340]   It's a question of balance here.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.300]   I say don't be so busy that you don't have time to behold.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.220]   These things are not contradictions.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:48.860]   There was never a busier man than the Apostle Paul, but he spent a great deal of his time
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   in beholding the glory of the Lord.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   How do you do it?
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.060]   Well, you do it, you see, by coming to the house of God.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.820]   He revealed something of his grace and glory here.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:06.620]   And you take time here to think of him, to look at him, to meditate upon these things
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.180]   in the sanctuary, but in the Bible.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.180]   He's here.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.700]   He comes to meet you here.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.580]   If you want to see the glory of the Lord, read your Bible.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.980]   Not just those few verses, you know, and then the little comment and dash off to the train.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.140]   That's not Bible study.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.980]   Spend your time in it.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.940]   Dig deep and get at the doctrine.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.820]   Look into it, seek for him.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.820]   He's here.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.100]   This is the mirror, as it were, in which you'll find him.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.460]   And then meditation, after you've read, stop and think.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.460]   Don't say, "Yes, I know that.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.700]   You know, we're all following schemes and we tick it off.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.700]   We've done this."
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:49.860]   Oh, these synopses, these digests, God deliver us from them.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   We've got it all taped.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:51.980]   We understand it all.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.980]   Of course you don't.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.320]   You don't know anything about it.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.540]   You know nothing unless you know something of the glory of the Lord.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:05.260]   And unless there's something of that manifest in you, knowledge puffeth up.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.260]   Love builds up.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.020]   That's what we need.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.260]   We don't need to be puffed up.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.820]   There are too many such Christians.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.860]   Got it all with the slick schemes.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:18.300]   Oh, my dear friends, where's the art of meditation?
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.260]   Find him, look for him, stay with him, meditate upon it.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.620]   Think of what you're being prepared for.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.380]   Think of that glory that is there awaiting us and for which we are all destined as the
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.660]   son of God.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.420]   Spend time over this, I say.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.220]   Compel yourself to do so.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.940]   And then you'll meet with him one day in a manner that you've never known of in your
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:39.940]   life.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.380]   He'll come to you and you'll be ravished, you'll be overwhelmed, you'll be a new Christian
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.380]   altogether.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.580]   That's the way.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.460]   And then prayer.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.740]   Seeking him in prayer.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.580]   The personal realization of all this.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.900]   But don't stop at the personal.
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.740]   Start with the personal.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.980]   We must all know him like this, one by one.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.020]   We must all experience the glory one by one.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.420]   It can be done.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.340]   This is something that should be constantly going on in the church.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.820]   And indeed it has been going on constantly in the church.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.180]   There are people who are rejoicing in this glory.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.700]   The world doesn't know anything about them.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.900]   Nothing spectacular as it were.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.860]   It isn't advertised, but it's there and these are the salt of the earth.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:30.460]   These are the people who often have been used of God to lead to great revival.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:36.140]   These are known people who having known the glory of the Lord themselves have become intercessors.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.140]   They've prayed.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.620]   I've reminded you many times of the two women who prayed for Moody and there have been many
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.700]   other such instances.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:49.540]   Unknown insignificant people who have known the glory of the Lord and have met with him
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.580]   and have been led out in prayer.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:55.700]   They've said, "Oh, that everybody might have this that thou has granted unto me."
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.340]   That's prayer for revival.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:02.620]   And so they go on praying for God to come back amongst us.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.740]   No longer to hide his face.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:10.100]   Turn us, shine upon us and we shall be turned.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.220]   They go on praying and they go on and on.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.380]   They can't be stopped.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.780]   They say with Jacob, "I will not let thee go."
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.020]   Jacob realized who this man as it were who was struggling with him was.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.460]   He will, "I will not let thee go.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.900]   Tell me thy name."
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.900]   This is the prayer.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.900]   "Show me thy glory," says Moses.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.100]   We once considered that together here.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:36.460]   This is the prayer, this intense desire and this refusal to be refused.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.060]   "I will not let thee go."
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:48.500]   But as Isaiah exhorts us, "Give him no rest till he establish, till he make Jerusalem
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.060]   a praise in the earth."
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.420]   He was set in a difficult time again.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:58.300]   Isaiah, the troubles of those times and that is his exhortation to the people.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.940]   He's talking about prayer to God.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.540]   "Give him no rest," he says.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:09.020]   "Give him no rest till he establish and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth."
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   Why?
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:17.180]   We've got the greatest encouragement possible from our blessed Lord himself who spoke the
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:21.580]   parable of the importunate widow.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.740]   "Don't give him, keep on."
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:30.500]   If I may venture on such an expression, "Worry God, bother God.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.100]   Don't give him rest nor peace.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.100]   Don't stop.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:40.900]   Keep on like the importunate widow until you have seen and felt and realized something
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:48.100]   of the glory in the blessed fellowship and communion with God.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.900]   And until you are certain and sure that this process of glorification has started in you
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.940]   is going on progressively, that you are being changed from glory to glory.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.740]   Go on meditating upon these things.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:11.220]   Go on praying to him to have pity and mercy and compassion until he shall be pleased to
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:21.780]   turn again to us, to smile upon us and indeed to descend into our midst and show forth again
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:28.100]   the glory of his power and the wonders of his grace.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:37.100]   Oh that God would awaken us and all his people to the possibilities that are here and now
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:47.180]   for us in and through our blessed Lord and Savior and the glory indescribable that awaits
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.180]   us.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.340]   Amen."
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:56.260]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
