[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.640]   - Lately we are working our way through some frank questions
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.240]   from married couples.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.480]   And we have an email from a husband today.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480]   "Pastor John, my wife and I are happy
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.480]   "and thank God a healthy couple.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.880]   "We live in Mexico City and we are in our late 30s.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.520]   "We have been Christians since our adolescence.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.080]   "We have two kids and one more coming in the next month,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.240]   "a great blessing for us.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120]   "We would like to know what the Bible teaches
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.000]   "about birth control, especially permanent surgeries
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.320]   "like a vasectomy or other options out there for men.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.600]   "Are permanent birth control decisions
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.820]   "aligned with God's will?"
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.720]   - Let me talk through, walk through principles
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.520]   that have guided me in this.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.160]   Been married for 46 years.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.600]   We have used various methods of,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800]   I like the term conception control now
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.500]   and it'll be clear why before we're done.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.160]   Abortion is birth control and I don't like that.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.560]   I don't claim infallibility here, of course,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.680]   and we have to talk so carefully
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680]   when there are no very direct instructions in scripture.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.920]   In Genesis 2.18, so I'm gonna go back now.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.640]   This may not make sense at first,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.140]   but it'll start making sense in about two minutes.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.400]   In Genesis 2.18, it says,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840]   "The Lord said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.'"
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.180]   Now that makes marriage normal and good.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960]   And then if you add Genesis 1.28,
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.560]   be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.660]   Now the normal good reality of marriage
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.920]   is strengthened with the normal rightness
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.840]   and corporate obligation on humanity
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.160]   to have babies and fill the earth with faithful image bearers.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.000]   Then comes the fall.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.360]   So you see, you've got marriage and baby having
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.280]   as virtually normative before the fall.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.680]   Then comes the fall of man into sin
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.720]   and what was normal and good and to be expected
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.060]   and a corporate obligation on humanity, what becomes of it?
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.060]   Well, astonishingly, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2.19,
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.700]   1 Corinthians 7, that he loves his singleness
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.580]   and he wishes everybody could be in his condition.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.540]   He says in 1 Corinthians 7.7,
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.320]   "I wish that all were as I myself am."
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.500]   But he knows that's not gonna happen
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.480]   and it's not God's will.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.060]   Each one has his own gift from God,
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.660]   one of one kind and one of another,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.940]   as though singleness might be a gift from God.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.900]   I mean, he's like, "Whoa, whatever happened to Genesis 2.18?
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.820]   It's not good for man to be alone."
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.940]   And then he explains why in chapter seven,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.960]   verses 32 to 34 of 1 Corinthians,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.300]   "I want you to be free from anxieties.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.240]   The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.220]   how he can please the Lord.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.700]   But the married man is anxious about worldly things,
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.300]   how he can please his wife and his interests are divided.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.540]   And the unmarried or betrothed woman
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.340]   is anxious about the things of the Lord,
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.700]   how to be holy in body and spirit.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.000]   But the married woman is anxious about worldly things,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.980]   how to please her husband."
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.660]   That's amazing.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.600]   And here's what I infer from it,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.340]   that there are realities that came into the world
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.340]   after the fall that make life more complicated
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.380]   than it was before the fall
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.300]   in regard to marriage and having children.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.660]   If there were no sin,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.100]   if there were no need for a world mission
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.700]   of sacrifice and martyrdom and suffering,
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.900]   then everybody marrying and everybody having children
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.980]   would be virtually an absolute.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.140]   In other words, if we live before the fall.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.220]   But we don't live in that world,
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.600]   and other factors determine how we live.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.880]   So Paul is not driven by Genesis 2.18,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.640]   "It is good for men, not good for men to be alone."
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.040]   He's driven, he's not even driven by Genesis 1.28,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.920]   "Be fruitful and fill the earth," by having babies.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   He's driven by reach all the nations,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.800]   pour out your energies to present them obedient
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.240]   and mature in Christ.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.080]   Be ready to go to prison in every city you visit.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.800]   Be ready to be in danger on every road,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   in every river, in every city.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.360]   Be ready to die at any moment, Paul.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.080]   That's what's driving Paul.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.000]   That call of God on his life in a fallen age
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.440]   to be a unique instrument to spread the gospel.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.520]   For him, that meant singleness,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   which is a very effective birth control if you're chaste.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.100]   So I infer from this pattern
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.600]   that the post-fall order of redemption
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   qualifies the pre-fall order of creation
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   that applies to both marriage and having children.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.680]   Having them, I would say,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.440]   is not an absolute command anymore.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.420]   What principles then should guide a couple?
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.280]   That's what they really asked, I think,
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.540]   and here are five principles
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.640]   that I draw out of that reflection.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.440]   Number one, sex is not just for procreation,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.480]   but for Christ-exalting delight, Song of Solomon,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.880]   and for protection against sexual temptation,
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.800]   1 Corinthians 7, 5.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.640]   So I don't think a Christian couple is obliged
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   to aim at procreation each time they have sexual relations.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.820]   That's principle number one.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.960]   Number two, not killing a conceived child
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.680]   is a top-level Christian commitment,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.800]   which means not getting an abortion
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.400]   and not using a contraceptive
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.760]   that works as an abortifacient.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.120]   And from that, I mean, from the little reading
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.880]   that I have done,
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.060]   I think most of the pills
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.880]   do run the risk of functioning as an abortifacient.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.600]   I'm no authority there, I can't say that.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.680]   I just know reading Randy Alcorn on this
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   has given me much pause,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.720]   because Randy's very vigilant on this,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.080]   and I respect that a lot.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.360]   I think, I mean, one of the things I tremble most about
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.400]   from 45 years ago is whether Noelle and I
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.880]   may have inadvertently aborted a baby
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.000]   because of pills that I wasn't even thinking in those terms,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.800]   that some of these pills work that way.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.560]   So that's principle number two.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   Whatever method of guarding against conception that you use,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.940]   don't go the route of aborting fertilized eggs,
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.500]   which have become human beings.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   Number three, don't make long-term commitments to sterility
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   when you don't have sufficient information
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.920]   to know if it's wise.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.600]   So that's good at getting at their vasectomy
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.360]   and tube tying question.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.720]   Unless you know that these operations
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.320]   are affordably reversible,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.060]   tying the tubes, getting a vasectomy,
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.240]   may be presumptuous in the mind of God,
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.880]   not pleasing to God.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.680]   I have told couples many times over the years,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.840]   premarital counseling and after,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.180]   what if your spouse dies?
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.160]   So say you're 30 years old.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.600]   What if your spouse dies?
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.680]   And two years later, healed in measure,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.160]   you remarry a woman or a man
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.280]   who really wants to have children with you.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.360]   And you've already made that impossible.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.320]   Those are the kinds of circumstances I mean,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.820]   when I say you may not have information
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.080]   to tell you that it's wise to do this now.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.840]   And there are other situations
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.520]   that I could think of as well.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.760]   So I would just caution
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.520]   that kind of permanent sterilization.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.740]   Number four, principle number four to guide us.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.840]   Avoiding conception may or may not
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.800]   intrude upon the rights of God
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.700]   to decide the number of your children.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.160]   A lot of people are concerned like,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.040]   do I have any right to do anything here?
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.120]   Isn't that God's prerogative?
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.640]   It would intrude, I think,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.760]   if you pursue contraception
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.800]   for your own selfish ends
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.440]   and not his priorities.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   But I don't think it would intrude
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.760]   on his rights and priorities
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.960]   if you humbly submit to biblical principles
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.080]   and guidelines like these
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.160]   that I'm trying to develop here.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.360]   Then you become, I think,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.200]   an instrument of God's sovereignty,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.840]   not an intrusion.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.160]   And the last one,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   the last principle to guide us.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.760]   Don't decide against children
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.720]   because they're a burden
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.440]   to your lifestyle of travel
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.800]   and free evenings.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.020]   In other words,
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.520]   everything I have been saying
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.120]   assumes a radical commitment
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.440]   to kingdom purposes,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.940]   not worldly conveniences.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.240]   If we decide to have children
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.160]   or not to have children,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.360]   let it be worshipfully
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.080]   because we have said yes
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.360]   to God's radical call on our lives,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.200]   not selfishly,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.360]   because it spares us some discomfort.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.800]   - Excellent counsel, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   And this is one of many questions
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.040]   from married couples we have received on sex,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.000]   which we have addressed
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.520]   and which you can find in our new landing page.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.920]   Go to DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.960]   At the top of the page, click on the tab that says More,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.160]   and then click on Ask Pastor John.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.880]   And there you can search hundreds of past episodes,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.240]   get the free apps,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.220]   ask John Piper a baffling question
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.560]   or a follow-up question, all that.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.160]   And it's all made possible
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.220]   because of our generous financial donors
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.880]   who are behind the mission of Desiring God
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.200]   and who make this podcast possible.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.400]   So thank you to all of the donors out there listening.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.960]   I'll see you on Monday.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
