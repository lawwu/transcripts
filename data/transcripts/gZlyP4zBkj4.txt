[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   I think that people, we're always stuck between these two choices.
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.800]   Should we work harder?
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.660]   Should we rest?
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.700]   Should we spend more money?
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.680]   Should we save more money?
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.040]   For everyone listening, I don't know what your life looks like.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.360]   I don't know who you are, what your dreams are.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.300]   What's important is to recognize that there's a balance between these two things.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.200]   And being honest with yourself and intentional is the only way to do this and create peace
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.680]   in your life.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.880]   There's no way that I can tell someone, hey, you're 25, you need to grind, you need to
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.340]   bear it out for the next five years.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.100]   Or, hey, you're grinding it out, but you hate your job, you need to quit.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.880]   This is a delicate balance here where you need to make the decisions for your own life.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.360]   I just think it's important to set up these questions because within these questions, within
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.000]   this paradox, is everything that it means to be alive.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700]   We have to balance all of these forces.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.100]   The more intentional that we are, the more time that we give to thinking about this, naturally
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.420]   we learn to do what we know we should do.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.020]   And I think that's an important thing.
