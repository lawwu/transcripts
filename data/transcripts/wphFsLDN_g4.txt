[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Hello, July, and welcome back
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.760]   to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.920]   And before we jump into today's episode,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.800]   I have a programming note for you to pass on.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.280]   Pastor John and I will be taking next week off
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.440]   from the podcast, so there's gonna be no episodes
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.040]   all of next week.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.260]   We've been at this for a little over 180 consecutive weeks
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.760]   nonstop, and we're nearing episode number 900.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   So many of you listen every day to the podcast,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.800]   and if that's you, thank you.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.960]   It's been a great run, and we have no intention of stopping,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840]   but we are taking one week off.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.160]   We'll return on July 11th with all new episodes.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.920]   Well, we are just days away from July 4th in the States,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.000]   Pastor John, Independence Day is what we call it,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.360]   and the ABJ inbox is loaded with political questions
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.200]   for you.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.180]   Christians in America, of course, find themselves
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.060]   in the midst of a bizarre political season, as you know,
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.060]   and there's an overall heightened partisan angst,
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.220]   I guess you could call it, that's dividing
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.100]   both major parties, and even with it,
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.680]   there's new levels of nationalism that we have not seen
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.500]   in this country for a while.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.860]   But as Christians, as we approach July 4th,
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.140]   we're called to live in this world as strangers
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.180]   and exiles and aliens and sojourners
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.580]   and pilgrims on this earth.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.300]   So, Pastor John, we've talked about this before
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.180]   on the podcast, but tell us again about the place
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.360]   and the role of patriotism in the Christian life.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.460]   - Well, we talked about this a couple of years ago,
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.460]   and most of what I was thinking then, as I reviewed it,
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.100]   still needs to be said, I think,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.280]   but there are a few additional thoughts
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.260]   that I'll weave in and put at the end
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.500]   in view of the heightened awareness today
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.140]   of possible conflicts, at least this is the way
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.580]   I feel it, possible conflicts between patriotism
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.220]   and Christian commitment.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.100]   So let me just jump in.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.440]   We are pilgrims.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   We are exiles, sojourners, refugees ourselves,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.540]   in a very refugee-heightened culture.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.740]   1 Peter 2, "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles,"
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.900]   and Philippians 3, "Our citizenship is in heaven."
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.380]   So the question, I think, is being framed rightly.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.780]   We are citizens of heaven.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.260]   We are sojourners and pilgrims on the earth,
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.300]   and that is owing to the fact that this world is fallen,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.440]   not the fact that it's created.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   We're going to spend eternity in a created world.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.700]   So we're not aliens because earth is a bad thing,
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.540]   but Satan won't be the god of that world anymore
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780]   like he's the god of this world.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.700]   And that's what makes us feel so alien here
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.700]   is that the god of this world is Satan,
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.400]   and he holds such extensive sway in the systems
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.140]   of this world that the world is permeated with sin,
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.260]   and it makes us feel like we're not at home.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.100]   We're aching that we would be done with sin
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.560]   and at home with Jesus in the presence of his holiness,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   his holiness is the native air a Christian wants to breathe.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.740]   So when I say we are aliens and exiles
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.060]   and sojourners and pilgrims,
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.180]   I don't mean that the earth is a place we despise.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.660]   I mean that the structures we find ourselves in
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.300]   are so permeated with sin that we want something new.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.300]   However, I think God means for us to be enmeshed
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.500]   in the world in various ways.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.580]   We're not to go out of the world.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.620]   We're in the world.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.020]   We're not supposed to be of the world.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.180]   We are in a city.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.260]   We're in a state.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.940]   We're in a country and a continent.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.020]   There are all kinds of these geographical
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.900]   and cultural allegiances or identifications that we have.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.420]   And if I ask now, what is patriotism
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.520]   in this kind of paradoxical enmeshment?
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   My answer is that patriotism is a special love
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.760]   or affection, endearment for fatherland.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.560]   It could be a city.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.040]   It could be a state, a neighborhood.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   It could be a tribe.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.160]   It could be an ethnicity.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.040]   And that love is different from the general love
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.260]   that Christians have for everybody or for the whole world.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.920]   And the reason I think that's true,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.760]   and there are several reasons,
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.680]   one is that there are these special affections indicated
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.920]   in the Bible in various ways.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.040]   For example, in Galatians 6, it says,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.960]   "As you have opportunity to do good to everyone,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.660]   "especially to those who are of the household of faith,"
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.860]   especially to those who are of the household of faith.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.280]   It's as though there is this specialness
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.840]   about those who are close to you,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.800]   have a similar deep bond to you,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.380]   a kind of affection for them
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.280]   that's different from the world.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.020]   Or 1 Timothy 5, 8,
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.900]   "If anyone does not provide for his relatives
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.840]   "and especially for the members of his household,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.160]   "then he's denied the faith."
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.680]   So it seems like it's right
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   not only to have this general love for everybody
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.620]   that covers the world, covers our neighbors,
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.840]   covers our enemies, but also, and especially,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.380]   and especially for our families or those near to us.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.880]   And Paul himself said in Romans 9
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.260]   that he had a special burden for my brothers,
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.180]   my kinsmen, according to the flesh.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.820]   It doesn't seem to me that he would have written like that
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.320]   if it weren't appropriate for him
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   to feel some kind of special affection for his fellow Jews,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.540]   a kind of patriotism for his ethnicity of Jewishness.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.780]   So there's something about this flesh,
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.780]   this close identity that being bound together
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.180]   in a family way or a cultural way
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.100]   that makes us love them with an unusual kind
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.420]   or a special kind of affection.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.980]   And as I was trying to think through,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.820]   now, is this legitimate?
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.460]   I mean, I'm pointing out that it exists,
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.840]   that it's got pointers in the Bible,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.300]   but it was C.S. Lewis who helped me
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.460]   with some categories in his book, "The Four Loves."
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.620]   He said that there's the love of philos,
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.980]   which is friendship, the love of eros, which is sex,
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.140]   and the love of agape, which is the love of God.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.940]   And then he added, there's this love called storge,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.580]   which I found to be the most interesting one.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.380]   And storge is a kind of affection
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.780]   that you feel for a pair of slippers
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.020]   that you've worn way too many years,
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.980]   and your wife wants to throw them out,
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.940]   and you'd commit hairy carry if she,
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.980]   no way you're gonna throw these slippers out.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.180]   They fit like a glove, or for me,
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.700]   and Noel, it's sweaters that I wear
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.780]   until the elbows are gone,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.020]   'cause I sit here at my desk
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.580]   and rubbing my elbows all the time,
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.700]   and she wants to toss them out,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.540]   and I say, no, I love this sweater.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.860]   It's just, it's got associations.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.660]   And I mean, so this is what he means by storge,
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.380]   a little kid who has a rag doll
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.900]   that's just rags is what it is,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.060]   and they wouldn't part with it for anything.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.900]   That's a little kind of patriotism
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.220]   that is probably very, very good, very admissible.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.780]   At least C.S. Lewis makes the case that it is.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.540]   There's an old tree that Noel and I carved our initials in.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.980]   In fact, it's gone now.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.620]   It made me so mad.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.620]   For decades, for about three and a half decades,
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.180]   we went back to Wheaton, and we walked to that tree,
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.980]   and we could actually find, 30 years later,
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.340]   those initials just barely discernible
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.820]   as the bark was gnarling over.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.340]   Well, we liked that tree.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.580]   We liked that tree more than other trees,
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.740]   and so on.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.420]   You get the idea that there's this kind of affection
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.380]   for a tree or a city or a fatherland
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.380]   or a language or a culture,
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.900]   and it's because it fits you.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.140]   When you leave it, you get on a plane,
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.660]   you go to another country,
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.620]   yeah, there's an excitement and a challenge
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.260]   and a stimulation of going another place,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.900]   but there's something inside that when you come home,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.020]   it just feels wonderful to eat the food
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.020]   and lie in your own bed and be in your own living room
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.300]   and walk your own streets,
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.740]   and hear your own language.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.540]   All that seems to be something
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.500]   that God puts his approval on.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   So I think, yes, yes, there is such a thing,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.100]   a good thing is patriotism,
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.460]   and with regard to nations,
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.740]   it seems like Romans 13,
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.380]   in calling us to be subject to the powers
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.500]   that wield the sword,
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.180]   implies that in some sense,
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.460]   a country identity or a nation state identity
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.220]   has the right to use that sword
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.940]   to defend itself against aggression,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.780]   and thus in some sense,
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.780]   preserve its right to exist and exist as it exists.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.700]   And so I think that implies
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.140]   that there is a proper place for patriotism
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.220]   at the national level.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.220]   So maybe we should wrap it up by saying
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.300]   whatever form your patriotism takes,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   let it be a deep sense that we are more closely bound
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.100]   to brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.940]   in other countries, other cultures,
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.940]   than we are to our closest unbelieving compatriot
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.380]   or family member in the fatherland or in the neighborhood.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.300]   That's really crucial to feel that, I think.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.420]   Otherwise, I think then our patriotism
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.900]   is drifting over into idolatry.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.420]   God is our King, not man.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.180]   His kingdom is our final allegiance.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.060]   But under that banner,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.180]   it's right to be thankful
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.340]   that God gave us our land freely.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.180]   I'm thinking now particularly of America.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.700]   He gave this to us freely.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.140]   I didn't deserve to be born here.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.940]   It wasn't my choice.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.060]   We don't deserve this place
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.460]   any more than I deserve any other common grace
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.140]   or special grace.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.300]   It's right to be thankful
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.340]   that people paid a high price
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.580]   to preserve our land with its freedoms
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.020]   and its cultural distinctives.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.940]   And it's right to be thankful
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.420]   that we have all these cultural slippers to put on
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.940]   that we don't want to throw away.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.220]   But I have to come back in closing
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.020]   to our alien exile sojourner status
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.620]   as the main thing.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.060]   We are citizens of heaven
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.260]   before we are earthly patriots,
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.220]   which means that there are bound to be conflicts
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.300]   between the way Christ our King calls us to live
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.980]   and the ways our beloved homeland expects us
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.900]   to live from time to time.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.060]   And the other reminder
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.060]   that the culture and ethos
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.180]   of the earthly homeland we love,
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.980]   the other reminder that I have to give
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.460]   is it's not static.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.900]   That is the thing I love about America.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.340]   It's not static.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.620]   It's changing.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.660]   It's always changing.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.140]   It always has been changing.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.580]   America today is not the America of the '50s,
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.540]   which means that there is a sense of conflict
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.020]   not only between our earthly homeland and other cultures,
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.180]   but also between what our earthly homeland was
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.260]   and what it is becoming.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.340]   And so how do you do patriotism
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.340]   when what you regard as your own culture
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.620]   is in a process of transformation?
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.500]   And in both of those kinds of conflicts,
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.420]   the one from outside, the one from inside,
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.180]   our stance, I think, should be
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.180]   not primarily as earthly culture preservers.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.620]   That's my main job.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.940]   I mean, my main mentality
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.940]   is to produce a preservation of my pure culture,
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.260]   'cause I think that produced the horrors of Nazi Germany,
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.420]   where the Aryan race was the Germanic race
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.900]   and prized so highly and preserved so intensely,
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.020]   it resulted in the slaughter of other people.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.340]   So we gotta be very careful
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.300]   about exalting our racial or ethnic
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.180]   or cultural patriotism or at-homeness, our slippers,
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.660]   to the point where we begin to demonize
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.780]   and actually hurt others.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.260]   Our stance should be we are Christians first,
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.540]   and as challenges come to our culture from within
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.820]   and from without, we bring kingdom values
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.820]   to bear on these challenges,
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.300]   not just earthly preferences.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.540]   I think C.S. Lewis might say,
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.540]   "Agape," the love of God, "orders storge."
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.540]   It orders phylos. It orders eros.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.020]   In other words, these earthly loves of friend and sex
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.220]   and affections for country and for our favorite slippers
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.460]   are ordered and kept in their proper place
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.580]   by a superior allegiance to God.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.100]   Our love for God is primary.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.860]   Only the value of our King, God, Jesus,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.740]   can bring a right ordering of the value of our earthly loves.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.020]   Only our Heavenly Father, our heavenly patriotism,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.900]   can order our earthly patriotism.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.900]   - Amen to that. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.540]   And that book mentioned earlier
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.420]   was "The Four Loves" by C.S. Lewis.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.580]   And with that, we are gonna break for the weekend
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.820]   and we're gonna break for the week.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.420]   As I mentioned, we have released about 900 episodes so far
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.660]   in the APJ Archive.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.300]   I know a few of you have listened to every single episode
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.140]   and that's amazing to me.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.060]   If you need to catch up on some of them,
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.380]   I would encourage you to take some time over the next week
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.580]   to scan or search through all the episodes
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.540]   we've released over the years.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.940]   And of course, you can scan those episodes really easily
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.780]   in the APJ app that we made for Apple and Android devices,
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.180]   or you can go to our web home
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.820]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.780]   I'm your host Tony Renke,
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.060]   and I will see you back here on July 11th in about a week.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.020]   We'll see you then.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:23.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
