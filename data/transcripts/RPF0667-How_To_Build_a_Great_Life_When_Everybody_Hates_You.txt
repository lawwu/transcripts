[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.760]   ♪
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.360]   In all France, there was no happier, more contented mouse than Anatole.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.700]   He lived in a small mouse village near Paris, with his dear wife Doucette,
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.840]   and their six charming children, Paul and Paulette, Claude and Claudette, Georges and Georgette.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.840]   Every evening as the sky darkened, the husbands and fathers bicycled along the boulevard toward Paris
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020]   to find food for their families.
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.760]   Once arrived, they entered people's houses through secret passageways known only to themselves.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.020]   Anatole's partner was usually Gaston.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.600]   One night, while they were looking for leftovers in someone's kitchen,
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.100]   Anatole heard people in the next room talking about mice.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.560]   Curious, he crept under the sofa and listened.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.300]   "Oh, those terrible mice," complained a woman.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.540]   "They sneak into my kitchen, they rummage around in my garbage pail,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.240]   or pull themselves up to the table and take what is there.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.080]   Sometimes they even nibble at untasted food.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.440]   This I must throw away.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.940]   Heaven knows how dirty their paws are."
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.320]   "They are a disgrace to all France," said a man angrily.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.920]   "To be a mouse is to be a villain."
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.820]   Deeply shocked, Anatole ran back to the kitchen.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.320]   "Gaston, we must leave at once."
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.160]   On the way home, Anatole, greatly upset, told his friend what had happened.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.360]   "Bah, a mere trifle," scoffed Gaston.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.400]   "People are people, and mice are mice.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.680]   Our loved ones must eat, and our only hunting grounds are people's homes."
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.200]   "But I never dreamed they regarded us this way," cried the unhappy Anatole.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.720]   "It is horrible to feel scorned and unwanted.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.720]   Where is my self-respect?
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.640]   My pride?
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.800]   My honor?"
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.640]   Gaston shrugged his shoulders indifferently.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.840]   "Resign yourself, Anatole.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.600]   C'est la vie."
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.840]   Doucet comforted him.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   "You are so right, Anatole," she said sadly.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.320]   "If only we could give people something in return, but alas, that is impossible."
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.200]   Anatole jumped up and danced Doucet around the room.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   "Impossible?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.280]   Perhaps not, ma petite.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.000]   You have given me a wonderful idea."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.800]   He sat down at the typewriter and typed thirty or forty signs that said, "Extra specially
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.360]   good.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.560]   Specially good.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   Good.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.160]   Not so good.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.580]   No good."
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.200]   Then he stuck a long pin through each sign and put them all away carefully in his briefcase.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.120]   Riding to Paris that evening, Anatole said, "Gaston, will you feel insulted if I go
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.360]   off alone after this?
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   I have an idea that I must work on in secret."
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.280]   Gaston answered, "I am your friend, n'est-ce pas?
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.600]   A friend is never insulted.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.040]   A friend has faith.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.400]   Good luck."
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.580]   When they reached Paris, Anatole left the others and headed toward the business part
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.620]   of town.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.960]   He parked his bicycle in front of the Duval Cheese Factory.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.180]   "Manufacture du fromage Duval."
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.740]   He squeezed his small mouse's body easily under the door, not forgetting his briefcase.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.240]   How heavenly it smelled inside.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.840]   His sensitive nose sniffed many delicious cheeses.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.680]   "Camembert, Torte Salute, Bleu, Saint-Maslin, Roquefort, Brie.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.280]   Well," thought Anatole, "I mustn't stand here sniffing all night.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.000]   There is work to be done."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.080]   He hurried down one dark passageway after another until he found what he was looking
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.240]   for, the cheese-tasting room.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.960]   It was dimly lit, filled with long wooden tables.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.280]   On them stood great mounds of cheese of all shapes and sizes.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.640]   Without further delay, Anatole climbed up on the nearest table.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.360]   First, he tasted a bit of Camembert.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.200]   "Mmm, couldn't be better."
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.680]   He opened his briefcase, took out an "extra specially good" sign, and pinned it on the
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.920]   cheese.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.580]   The next one tasted much too sharp.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.960]   He used a "not so good" sign and wrote something on it in pencil.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.720]   Up and down the long rows of cheeses went Anatole for hours and hours, sniffing and
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.680]   tasting and pinning on signs.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.880]   "Good.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   Not creamy enough."
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.120]   "Specially good, but another pinch of salt."
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.720]   "Not so good.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   Add more goat's milk."
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   "No good.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   Throw it away."
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.920]   "Good, but less black pepper."
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   "Not so good.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.000]   Needs more grated onion."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.640]   "No good."
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.400]   "Good, but add some more orange peel."
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.960]   "Specially good.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   Add a little vinegar."
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.600]   "Extra specially good."
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.880]   At last, his work was finished.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.320]   "Voilà, now the Duval factory will earn a thing or two.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.640]   Mice are known everywhere as the world's best judges of cheese.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.720]   And as for myself, I shall bring some home proudly, for I have honorably earned it."
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.660]   Next morning at the factory there was great excitement.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.420]   Everyone wondered who had written the strange little signs.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.440]   In marched Monsieur Duval himself.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.460]   "We'll see just how much this Anatole knows about cheese."
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.080]   He tasted some Roquefort.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.120]   "Touche, Anatole is right.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.600]   This does need more orange peel.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.320]   Now listen all of you.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.040]   Business has been none too good lately.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   We'll try making cheese Anatole's way and see what happens."
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.420]   Every night Anatole left more of his little signs, and every day the cheese workers made
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.360]   more changes.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.880]   Soon business began to boom.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.920]   The people of France demanded "Duval cheese or no cheese at all."
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.440]   Orders poured in so fast that Monsieur Duval enlarged his factory and gave everybody a
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.460]   raise in salary.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.280]   But he couldn't discover who was leaving the signs.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.520]   "Why doesn't Anatole appear?"
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.160]   Monsieur Duval asked his secretary.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.300]   "He deserves to be rewarded.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.240]   We owe all our good fortune to him."
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.500]   He wrote a little note, begging to meet Anatole.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.200]   But Anatole wrote back that he preferred to remain unknown.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.640]   Monsieur Duval even had every employee named Anatole come to his office for questioning,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.520]   but each one denied that he had left the signs.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.960]   It was no use.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.880]   The secret remained a secret.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.400]   Then one afternoon, Monsieur Duval rang for his secretary and dictated a very long letter.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.960]   That night, Anatole found the letter.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.600]   "Duval, le meilleur fromage du monde.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.080]   My dear Anatole, this letter comes to thank you for all you have done.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   Your success is due entirely to your wonderful work.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.160]   I am most anxious to meet you in person, but since you prefer to remain unknown, I shall
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.240]   respect your secret.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.920]   Whoever you are, it is clear that you love cheese greatly.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.200]   Please help yourself to all the cheese you like, as often as you like.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Every night there will be some good French bread left here for you, and chocolate eclair,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.440]   and other dainties.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.360]   Now I wish I could reward you more richly.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.040]   Anatole, we salute you.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.680]   From now on, we shall think of you fondly as First Vice President in charge of cheese
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   tasting.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.800]   Remember, you are always welcome here.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.520]   With every good wish for your happiness, your friend, Henri Duval."
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.600]   When Doucette saw the letter, she said, "No more snooping around in strange people's
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   houses for you.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.440]   That's finished forever.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.000]   You are the smartest mouse in the world."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.080]   Paul and Paulette, Claude and Claudette, and Georges and Georgette climbed up on his chair
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   and hugged him.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.880]   "We are so proud.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.160]   Our beloved papa is now a respectable business mouse."
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.720]   The next day, Anatole invited Gaston to be his helper.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.280]   The older mouse made a very deep bow.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.080]   "Gladly will I join you."
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.880]   Then he kissed his friend on both cheeks and cried, "Vive Anatole!
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.480]   Was he content to sit back and do nothing about our way of life?
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.600]   No, no.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:40.340]   He is a mouse of action, a mouse of honor, a mouse magnifique."
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.120]   And so it came to pass.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.960]   Anatole and his partner worked at the factory side by side in perfect harmony.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.720]   The secret stayed a secret always.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.760]   So if you should ever meet a mouse looking for leftovers, you will know at once that
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:06.680]   it cannot possibly be Anatole, the happiest, most contented mouse in all France.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.400]   The question for you today, my dear listeners, is, are you one who goes out and makes opportunities
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.280]   through service?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   Or are you one who sits back and takes from others?
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.080]   We all have a choice.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.800]   It's a daily choice.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.520]   Are we going to be a maker or a taker?
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.640]   A producer or a consumer?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.960]   Are we going to go out to the world looking for how we can serve or for how we can be
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.120]   served?
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   The rich rewards always come for those who serve.
