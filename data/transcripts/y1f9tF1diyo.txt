[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.380]   Cody Garrett, welcome to the Bogleheads On Investing podcast.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.380]   So glad to be here.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380]   Thanks so much, John.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.160]   I'm super excited to get to meet you in person for the first time at the 2023 Bogleheads
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   conference.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.920]   I'm going to be there.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.020]   And folks, as of this recording, there are roughly 60 spots left.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.400]   So if you want to register for that conference, go to boglecenter.net/2023conference.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.120]   Let's start with our first question.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.900]   This question is from username 95 suited.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.340]   He writes, does Cody have a process he uses with his clients to ensure their non-financial
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.880]   lives will be fulfilling in early retirement?
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.820]   What I realized is a lot of people focusing on retirement, they're really focused on what
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.980]   they're retiring from this emphasis on escaping something, right?
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.580]   It's like, I cannot wait to stop working.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.380]   But it's really important that anytime I'm working with a financial planning client,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.580]   they're really focused on what they're retiring from.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.940]   But it's my job to help them understand what are they retiring to.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.260]   I recently asked over 40,000 retirees on a Facebook group, what's the thing that you
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.700]   miss most about working besides the paycheck, besides the benefits?
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.720]   They missed conversations with colleagues and clients, collaborations with team members,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.460]   challenges to solve and contributions to a greater purpose.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.060]   Now you asked me about this process that I use to ensure non-financial lives will be
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.060]   fulfilling.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.900]   I asked them, especially pre-retirees, hey, in which ways would you like to continue connecting
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.220]   and having conversations with others?
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.580]   In which ways will you collaborate with other people?
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.720]   Sometimes that means collaborations with other organizations, maybe a charity that they support.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   Which types of challenges would you like to solve?
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.580]   So some people retire and they really want to do maybe woodworking or they want to do
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.980]   those projects around the house.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660]   So they can be physical or mental challenges that they want to solve in retirement.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.900]   And then lastly, how are you going to contribute in retirement to a greater purpose?
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.660]   Going to the Bogleheads conference, right?
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.300]   That's a way that you can have conversations, you can collaborate with others, you can learn
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.940]   some new challenging things.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.340]   Some of the mental challenges you have can be possibly solved at going to a conference
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.340]   like that.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.620]   And then you can contribute to something bigger than yourself by just being surrounded by
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.540]   other people within your community.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.860]   So community, conversations, collaborations, challenges, and contributions.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.300]   So start asking yourself even now, if you're not retired or you are retired, how can I
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.020]   do more of those things now that I'm retired?
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.640]   And for folks who are looking to get some community, they should check out their local
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.160]   Bogleheads chapters.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.980]   We have a great chapter here in San Diego with a lot of retirees.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.620]   And it's a great forum where folks can help each other make friends and talk about low
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.060]   cost investing.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.680]   For folks who want to get involved with the Bogleheads community locally, check out the
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.300]   Bogleheads forums, where we have a page that lists local chapters.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.480]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.620]   One thing I want to add to that is we think about FIRE as standing for Financial Independence
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.780]   Retire Early, but I actually call it Financial Independence Recreational Employment.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.760]   Financial independence isn't necessarily about stopping work or escaping from work.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.180]   It's really about doing work because you want to, not because you have to.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.580]   A lot of people who assume they're going to retire early, they end up working once they're
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.180]   financially independent.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.340]   So keep in mind that financial independence doesn't mean you have to leave the work that
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.340]   you love.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.460]   It means that you can do work that's even more fulfilling moving forward.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.460]   Cody, can you talk about what some of the folks you've worked with have done in early
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460]   retirement?
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.880]   In terms of conversations, I think a lot of people in retirement, they talk about spending
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.300]   more time with their family.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.020]   And I think it's really important that when spending time with family, it's not just travel
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.020]   a lot, right?
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.460]   But also being really intentional about the conversations you're having with your family.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.660]   So visualize, when we go on this trip as a family together, which type of topics do we
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.500]   want to discuss?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.700]   And people who go into retirement, some of the most valuable conversations they have
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.820]   is about what I call the financial family tree.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.260]   Sometimes families don't talk about money ever, but going into retirement, when you're
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.860]   talking with your family right after you retired, they're probably thinking about money.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.100]   You're thinking about money.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.080]   This might be a good time to start talking about some estate planning.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.140]   So what are some of your expectations and their expectations financially in terms of
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.140]   multi-generational wealth?
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.780]   This can be a very difficult conversation to have, but I think this is the most fruitful
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.040]   conversation when done with grace and compassion.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.980]   Instead of having them with colleagues and clients who are used to work, maybe you could
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.380]   have those deeper conversations with your family and not necessarily your kids.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.500]   What are the conversations that you'd like to have with your spouse?
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.860]   Now you're probably spending more time at home with your spouse, if you're married or
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.660]   your partner or your neighbors.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.580]   Maybe it's time you can actually start having conversations, you can start talking with
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.120]   people who live down the street.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.700]   Your friends that you know that have been retired for a long time, and you can finally
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.700]   spend time with them.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.900]   A really good example is clients who every Wednesday, they have a morning breakfast with
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.620]   all the friends they used to work with who are also retired.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.460]   So think to yourself, what type of conversations do I want to have that build me up, that are
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.500]   energy giving, not energy draining conversations?
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.860]   The second is collaborations.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.860]   I think collaborations can happen a lot of different ways.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.980]   Sometimes you might have a work project that you want to spend some time with.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.380]   A client that I work with, a fascinating story about what he wanted to retire to.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.020]   He loves the Volkswagen vans, the big vans from the 60s, and he says, "I've never had
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.020]   one.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.020]   I've always wanted one."
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.600]   He said, "When I retire, I'm going to buy my first Volkswagen van, and I want to spend
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.300]   most of my time fixing it up.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.540]   I don't want to buy one that's turnkey.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.220]   I want to buy one that's torn up and that I can work on and tinker with."
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.980]   First of all, that's a challenge to solve.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.740]   That would be a challenge for me working on an old van from the 60s.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.380]   He said, "Okay, well, maybe I can invite my son to help me work on this van together.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.180]   Once it's drivable, I can take my son.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.900]   We can have a father-son trip in this van that we've really tinkered with together."
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.300]   That's a very powerful way to continue building relationships with your family.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.540]   We all know that you spend over 90% of the time with your kids during your lifetime before
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.820]   they're 18.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.900]   If you're retiring, you do have kids, start thinking about what are some conversations
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900]   I can have with them?
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.460]   What are some ways we can collaborate on projects together?
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.640]   Maybe we can have challenges to solve together, not just individually.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   One thing that's really important for me to mention here is that your physical, mental,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.600]   spiritual, relational, and financial wellness are interrelated.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.320]   Going into retirement, we're usually primarily focused on the finances.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.640]   By the time we get to retirement, we realize that our physical health, our mental health,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.440]   our spiritual practices, our relationships have been kind of on the back burner for a
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   long time.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.600]   If you're listening to this and you haven't retired yet, how can you improve your physical,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.300]   mental, spiritual, relational health and not just be focusing on your financial spreadsheets?
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.680]   Because when you get to retirement, sometimes you have all the money in the world that you
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.640]   need to retire, but then you turn around and all your relationships are gone or they're
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.200]   not like they used to be.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.800]   So building up those relationships, doing the exercise that you've always been wanting
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.880]   to get into, maybe hiring a counselor or a therapist to talk about some of your mental
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.280]   health struggles.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.320]   Start having those conversations when you get into retirement.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.880]   This one is from username John Arndt from Twitter who writes, "What's the best method
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.400]   for determining sustainable spending rates?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.840]   For instance, how do you adjust the 4% withdrawal rate for retirees in their 40s?"
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.700]   The 4% rule or guideline, it's a decent rule of thumb.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.540]   People using the 4% rule, they're making an assumption that they're going to be living
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.780]   in retirement solely off of their portfolio without other sources of retirement income,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.100]   such as private and public pensions, social security, real estate income.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.780]   But the best way to visualize variable sources of income and expenses in retirement is to
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.980]   use an advanced financial planning software.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.680]   And now there are actually planning softwares even available to consumers, non-advisors.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.560]   One for example is New Retirement.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.540]   I know there's a lot of other Excel or Google Sheet versions that people have made.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.200]   Keep in mind that financial planning software, the output is only as good as the input.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.160]   When you're making assumptions for rates of return, inflation, life expectancy, it's better
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.720]   to be on the conservative side, right?
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   So conservative meaning that you're expecting to live a long time, maybe 95 plus in terms
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.440]   of your age, testing out different levels of inflation, testing out really conservative
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   rates of return.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.160]   So with that said, use financial planning software, but understand that it's only going
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.960]   to show you information based on a lot of user assumptions and historical performance,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.720]   which we know cannot guarantee future results.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.600]   Take it with a grain of salt, but at the same time, I think that using a financial planning
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.240]   software for those variable sources of income and expenses could be a much better way than
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   just saying, I'm going to use the 4% rule just based on my portfolio.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.480]   And that 4% rule comes from Bill Bengen, who first looked at that question, how much can
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.920]   I spend in retirement without running out of money?
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.680]   We interviewed him on episode 35 of the Bogleheads live show.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.120]   We also interviewed Christine Benz on episode 37, who sought to answer that same question
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.680]   through her research.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.420]   And then lastly, in episode 41, we interviewed Derek Tharp of Team Kitsis, where he talks
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.000]   about how to use retirement planning software.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.540]   I'll link to all those in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.960]   One of the big things that accumulators miss that aren't retired yet or about to retire,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.000]   they're thinking about the 4% rule in terms of multiplying their current expenses by 25.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.560]   But let's say you have 10 years until retirement, the 4% rule does include inflation assumptions,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.600]   but only once the distributions begin, not for the 10 years between now and when you
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.000]   start taking those distributions.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.880]   So make sure that you inflation adjust your expenses.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.380]   If you are going to be thinking about the 4% rule, even now, 10 years out from retirement.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:14.640]   This question is from Man of Clouds from Boglehead Reddit, who asks, what percent of bond/stable
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.380]   value allocation does Cody recommend for someone five to 10 years from retirement?
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.760]   To manage sequence of returns risk, I prefer either a barbell approach, which would be
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.720]   really having equity on one side and laddered fixed income on the other side to set up typically
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.240]   about five years of short term stability.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.400]   Another way to do it, especially popular within Boglehead's community, is to just use a total
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.360]   portfolio approach, but then have maybe one to three years of short term liquidity, cash
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   equivalent, right?
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.900]   So you're not chasing growth and income with that portion.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.240]   You're really focused on stability and liquidity with the three to five years of short term
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.400]   fixed income.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.080]   And on the flip side, you're going growth with the equity side of that barbell.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.360]   Although the second bucketing approach that I mentioned is often said to be irrational,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.440]   especially people say that during bull markets, they're like, why would you hold on to so
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.560]   much cash when the market's going up?
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.680]   It can be a reasonable way to sustain portfolio withdrawals while reducing that sequence of
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.840]   returns risk.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   And as important that most people don't think about is the reduction of investor anxiety.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.600]   So when I work with a retiree or somebody who's about to retire, they love knowing that
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.740]   the stock market volatility will not affect whether or not they're going to order dessert
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.120]   with dinner tonight.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.440]   I always tell people we don't want to make long term financial decisions based on short
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.600]   term volatility.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   We also don't want short term volatility in our long term assets to affect how we spend
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.880]   and enjoy retirement in the short term, having three to five years of short term liquidity
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.240]   and stability can really give you permission to enjoy your lifestyle and retirement without
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.100]   having to look at what the stock market does every day because what the stock market's
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.200]   doing every day is for my six plus year money, not my money that I'm spending within the
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   next five years.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.280]   And as we know, even the greatest recessions, depressions that we've seen have really not
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.720]   lasted longer than that.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.100]   I just say having three to five years of short term liquidity helps emotionally and also
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.280]   helps hedge against that sequence of returns risk, especially in the first few years of
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   retirement.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.820]   Certainly on average, if you hold a little bit more in cash or in short term, high quality
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.680]   bonds, the smaller investment return that you're going to get from that is going to
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.480]   drag on your portfolio, which means having a little bit less money that you'll be able
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.940]   to spend annually.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:27.500]   And if you can have that extra cash cushion to make you feel more comfortable with your
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.300]   long term investing approach, generally, I think that can make some sense for those folks
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.100]   who are nervous about their long term investments.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.900]   Now, it's not the most optimized approach.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.360]   But again, if you can feel better about having that cash cushion that can make you stay the
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.400]   course with a balance of your investments, that can often make a lot of sense.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.380]   People ask me all the time, "I'm scared about retiring, so I'm just going to work for one
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.380]   more year.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.880]   I'm just going to work for a few more years."
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.440]   So if taking some type of bucketing approach like this, having a few years of cash to make
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.100]   you feel a little better and make you pull the trigger on retiring earlier, right, when
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.300]   you can actually quantitatively, rationally afford it, I think it's a really good way
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.460]   to keep people from just waiting a few more years to retire.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.860]   Each year you wait to retire, that's fewer years of retirement.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.420]   So think about what you're giving up.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.860]   Again, you have to go beyond the numbers in these conversations.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:25.880]   This question is from the Bogleheads forums, "I'm looking at retiring soon in my late 40s.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.160]   I'm lucky enough to have a pension that is COLA protected from the military and very
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.240]   cheap health care for life.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.600]   How does Cody go about calculating how much pension/health care that is worth in the future?"
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.120]   This question often comes up when you're going to choose a pension or take the lump sum.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.100]   But when calculating a lump sum versus taking a pension, there are really two steps to this.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.660]   The first thing that people make a mistake on when calculating whether they should take
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.060]   the lump sum or the pension is they divide the annual pension amount, the income amount,
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.700]   into the lump sum amount to figure out kind of what their "rate of return" would be.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.220]   But this is one thing that we shouldn't do.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.580]   You know, a few differences there is one, you're effectively looking at like annual
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.400]   yield of something, but by the way, at the end of life, that pension's gone, right?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.820]   You don't have any more money at the end of that.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.460]   So a lump sum, right, you can take the same amount of income possibly, and actually at
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.260]   the end of life, you still have money there that can be distributed to your heirs.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.740]   Instead of just dividing the pension amount into the lump sum option, you need to use
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:32.440]   two time value of money calculations, TVM calculations, that require a few assumptions.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.340]   So life expectancy assumptions, those things that we talked about earlier with rates of
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.300]   return inflation over time, you talked about COLA protection, you know, cost of living
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.780]   adjustments on your pension.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.540]   A lot of pensions don't have that.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.620]   So you have to figure out what is the value of that pension going to be if there isn't
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.620]   a COLA adjustment.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.820]   There are two calculations that you would do.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.060]   One is a present value calculation, which is saying, what is the present value of those
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.700]   future cash flows, assuming a certain life expectancy?
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   If I were to end that pension at 95, how much would I have received from that?
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.220]   Effectively, you want to understand if I took the lump sum, what type of investment return,
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.660]   inflation adjusted, if it's not inflation adjusted pension that you're receiving, what
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.780]   would be the required rate of return needed to take that much out of the portfolio through
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.940]   the end of life and end with zero.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.820]   In terms of using your financial calculator, the number of periods would be the number
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.100]   of years between taking the lump sum at the end of life.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.060]   The interest rate would be really typically your inflation adjusted return or your rate
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.140]   of return for your investments.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.020]   The lump sum pension calculations are effectively saying, hey, if I were to take the lump sum,
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:41.380]   would I be able to create effectively my own annuity that would quote unquote, outperform
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.300]   the pensions actuarial assumptions.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.660]   When you're looking at the pension versus lump sum options, these weren't given to you
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.060]   as a challenge to say, which one do you think is best?
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.700]   Hopefully you choose the right one.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.140]   These were all actuarially calculated by insurance companies that are way better at math than
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.140]   we are.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.460]   So keep in mind that if you're comparing a lump sum versus a pension, they're actually
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.660]   equal in a way to them based on their assumptions, but it's up to you to figure out which assumptions
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.820]   do I have that would be different than the assumptions the insurance company is using.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.980]   If I know I have a chronic health condition, that probably would make the case for possibly
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.500]   taking a lump sum because you're not going to live long enough to take advantage of the
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.500]   longevity that the insurance company might be assuming for you.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.300]   Which assumptions might the insurance company be actuarially calculating and then which
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.060]   of those assumptions might actually be different for me?
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.140]   What are the things that I could plug into those assumptions?
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.260]   For example, chronic health conditions, whether or not I'm married, whether or not I want
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.160]   to leave money to future generations.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.300]   So those are the assumptions that can change whether or not you take a lump sum or a pension.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.740]   One thing I think about the annuitization versus lump sum distribution question, "Hey,
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.020]   should I take the lump sum or should I take the annuitization?"
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.180]   I am obsessively focused on that worst case.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:59.300]   And for me, I think about how to best manage that worst case, which is you living forever
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.460]   and that annuitization option is going to do that.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.500]   It's going to help manage that because as long as you're alive, you're going to get
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.220]   that annuity payment.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:12.260]   Now, if you guess wrong and maybe you die the next day, that won't be great, but perhaps
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.580]   that risk isn't as financially impactful as living forever and running out of money.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:22.180]   So my approach generally is to take that annuity option because it's a risk management approach,
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.460]   not necessarily the way they're going to transfer the most amount of money to your heirs, but
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.620]   certainly can help you have a higher quality of life during your lifetime.
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.180]   When you talk about beneficiary designations, when choosing between a lump sum and a pension,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.460]   you also have to think, "Okay, is this money just for me or is this money that I want to
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.420]   last beyond my lifetime?"
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.280]   If I have a spouse, maybe I want to think about using the joint survivor pension option
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.140]   versus a single life annuity.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.740]   Start to visualize what you want your retirement to look like and also what you want your generational
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.100]   wealth transfers to look like because that can also change whether or not you choose
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.260]   a lump sum versus a pension.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.340]   And to add emotionally, behaviorally there, sometimes taking a pension can actually give
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.100]   you permission to spend.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.060]   So if your only source of income in retirement is from your portfolio, you're probably going
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.300]   to be obsessed with your portfolio.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.220]   When the market goes down, you're going to be like, "I don't know if I can afford going
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.660]   on that trip next year."
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.140]   So the last thing you want is to let the short-term volatility of the portfolio really dictate
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.460]   your spending in retirement.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.180]   I know it's an important thing to consider, but the last thing you want is short-term
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.260]   stuff to affect your desired lifestyle.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.540]   So yeah, sometimes taking the pension can provide that cushion behaviorally, emotionally
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.460]   for you to spend the money that you actually can't afford to spend.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.020]   I always encourage folks to try and keep it simple as well.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.860]   And man, does that annuitization option keep it simple?
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.000]   You get that deposit into your checking account monthly, every two weeks, whatever.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.500]   That sure makes it easy.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.300]   Another thing that I always encourage GIYers to think is not just about what investment
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.860]   approach is most interesting and fun for them when putting it together, but what sort of
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.860]   legacy plan you're going to be leaving your possibly less interested spouse.
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.380]   That annuitization option, that's pretty great for that non-financially interested spouse,
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.340]   because worst case, you pass, they're still going to get those regular deposits into that
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.620]   checking account.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:13.780]   That can really be a great way to plan for legacy investing.
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.340]   This one is from Usain "WannaRetireEarly" from the MogulHeads forums who writes, "I'd
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:24.220]   like to better understand planning for health care, managing income to maximize Affordable
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.500]   Care Act subsidies, and also my kids will be in college, I want to be thinking about
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.620]   managing income to maximize subsidies for higher education."
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.620]   And for folks who want to learn more about how to manage the cost of health care in early
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.380]   retirement, we have a great Boglehead chapter series video on that.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.580]   I'll link to that in the show notes for folks to check out.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.660]   So managing health care in early retirement before Medicare actually isn't as difficult
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.660]   as you might think.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.580]   I know there's a lot of concern about the uncertainty of future health care costs.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.300]   There's like seven or eight different options for health care in early retirement.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.200]   But since you mentioned maximizing subsidies, you're talking about this premium tax credit.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.100]   So the premium tax credit for health coverage before Medicare and student financial aid
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.300]   are two major forms of subsidies, which may be worth prioritizing in early retirement.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.580]   So if a family is able to maintain its desired lifestyle in early retirement, due to control
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.900]   over sources of taxable income, this usually means having a pretty healthy balance between
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.780]   taxable pre-tax and tax-free accounts.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.820]   People on the path to early retirement, they'd be much better off creating some diversification
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.680]   in their asset location.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.820]   If a family is able to maintain that desired lifestyle and have control over sources of
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.620]   taxable income in early retirement, it's definitely worth running those scenarios against the
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:42.140]   opportunity cost of implementing other early retirement strategies, such as Roth conversions
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.460]   to maximize after-tax wealth.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.540]   Don't let your health care subsidies or the financial aid for a kid completely run your
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.700]   financial plan.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.600]   They are important variables to consider and to plug into the numbers, but don't let that
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.460]   rule all of your decisions.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.980]   So your ability to maintain your desired lifestyle in retirement, I think that should be a prioritization.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.020]   And then secondary to that should be any type of tax planning strategies that's worth doing
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.260]   sometimes, but just make sure that's not prioritized over the things that are much more important
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.260]   in early retirement.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.740]   Cote, you mentioned doing partial Roth conversions in early retirement, a pretty common strategy.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.420]   However, that's going to generate some taxable income.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.940]   And as that income increases, that means now we're looking at less subsidies for health
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.540]   care through the Affordable Care Act.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:34.580]   What's your preference doing partial Roth conversions or keeping income low to optimize
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.500]   for subsidies for health insurance in early retirement?
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.980]   Oh, that's a tricky and great question.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:46.180]   The big thing here, one reason that you might want to consider maximizing those subsidies
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.080]   is that the premium tax credit is that it's a credit.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   It's not a deduction.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.820]   A credit is a dollar for dollar return of taxes owed, taxes paid.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.300]   So this is very different from looking at the effect on Irma or the taxation of Social
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.140]   Security, things like that.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.780]   These tax credits are substantial.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.540]   I actually just talked with a family member yesterday that is receiving $460 a month of
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.700]   premiums completely for free.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.220]   I think this is one of those where you really have to understand the numbers.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:19.660]   You need to go to healthcare.gov/c-plans to really look at what is health care cost on
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.060]   the health insurance marketplace based on where you live.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.460]   You type in your zip code.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.620]   You also type in what's your anticipated modified adjusted gross income, in this case, in early
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.620]   retirement.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.700]   It's going to show you what your estimated premium tax credit could be.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.660]   And what you can do, it's really nice on that website, you can just say, well, okay, well,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.620]   what if my income is $80,000 instead of $60,000 a year?
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.260]   How does that affect my premium?
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.380]   So these are based on the federal poverty level up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.700]   It's broken that ceiling, at least temporarily, for premium tax credits.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.740]   You have to understand what is the credit I'm going to receive.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.220]   If you don't have an estimate of what those credits might be, then you want to make sure
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.220]   you do that first.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.220]   Once you understand what those credits may be, you can start filling in those marginal
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.900]   tax brackets, Roth conversions.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:08.060]   Say, what if I were to convert up the top of the 10%, 12%, 22%, 24% tax brackets in
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.540]   terms of Roth conversions?
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.540]   And then what would that level of modified adjusted gross income do to those premium
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.100]   tax credits?
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.300]   A lot of people come to me and they say, okay, how much should I convert to Roth over the
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.780]   next 10 years?
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.180]   Don't make 10 years worth of assumptions here.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.020]   Take one year at a time.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.540]   So at the beginning of each year, at the end of each year, determine how much am I going
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.540]   to convert.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.260]   And this year, am I going to prioritize premium tax credit or am I going to prioritize maximizing
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.700]   after-tax wealth with Roth conversions?
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.300]   I do it in mid-November every year for Roth conversions.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.180]   Keep it simple, one year at a time, and it'll take some of that anxiety out of the way.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.780]   Doing those calculations in mid-November certainly makes sense because you'll have a better idea
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.340]   closer to your end what your taxable income is going to be for the year.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.700]   Diplo Investor from Boglovs Farms writes, "We are four to five years out from retiring
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.860]   in our early to mid fifties, and we will both have decent federal pensions.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:07.860]   Only a question about what order to withdraw from, TSP or Roth IRA taxable when RMDs are
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.380]   still long, long way off."
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.740]   The typical order of operations for early retirement distributions is first starting
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.340]   with your checking and savings accounts.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.020]   Taking money out of those accounts, there's no age requirement, there's no taxes to take
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.220]   money out.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.700]   Then you go to your taxable brokerage accounts.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.860]   These are the accounts that are holding those investments that may offer qualified dividends
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.580]   and long-term capital gains tax treatment with no early withdrawal penalty.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.020]   Savings, checking accounts, and then taxable brokerage accounts.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.580]   These are all of the accounts that provide what I call cash flow flexibility, but they
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.500]   are taxable along the way.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.380]   So that income and dividend and capital gains distributions in the taxable brokerage accounts,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.500]   they're taxable along the way, even if you don't take money out of the accounts.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.180]   But the good thing about those accounts is the money you can actually take out of the
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.260]   accounts are not taxable.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.740]   Then after the taxable brokerage accounts, then we move on to the pre-tax retirement
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.740]   accounts.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:05.020]   These are the traditional IRAs, traditional 401Ks, 403Bs, 457s, and so forth.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.380]   If you are retiring early, right before 59 and a half, you'd have to be using some sort
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.740]   of early retirement distribution strategy.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.900]   So those may include what are called substantially equal periodic payments.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.940]   Some people call it the SEPP, the 72T payments.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.760]   There's the rule of 55, which is you do retire from that employer in or after the year you
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.300]   turn age 55, and that's specific to that employer's retirement plan.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.440]   Some people use Roth conversion ladders.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.340]   The reason they're called ladders is because there's a five-year holding period for Roth
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:41.060]   conversions before 59 and a half to avoid that 10% additional tax, also sometimes called
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.380]   the tax penalty.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.060]   So after you've taken money from your savings, checkings, taxable brokerage accounts, and
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.740]   pre-tax accounts, then lastly, usually as a last resort, those tax-free accounts such
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.980]   as Roth IRAs or HSAs.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.380]   The reason those are typically used last is because their highest and best use is long-term
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.540]   tax-free growth that we all love.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:05.020]   So usually letting those accounts grow long-term as long as possible is typical order of operations.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.060]   So once your desired living expenses are met in early retirement, going through that order
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.460]   of operations, then you would say, "Okay, maybe we need to do some gradual Roth conversions
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.220]   on top of that to reduce those future RMDs," even if they're a long way off, as you mentioned
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.220]   in your question.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:27.820]   Mike Piper talks about this question at the last BogleVs conference in 2022, "What accounts
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.580]   should I spend from in retirement?"
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.420]   There's a great video you can check out.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.300]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:42.540]   User name Introdon from the BogleVs forums writes, "I have VYM in my IRA.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:48.020]   Does it make sense to have an investment that gives qualified dividends taxed at the 23.8%
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.020]   rate?
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:56.100]   Will RMDs kick in, as I will most likely stay in a high tax bracket in retirement?"
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.900]   Since you mentioned you're in a high tax bracket, well, most likely stay there.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.100]   Qualified dividends, if they were held within a taxable brokerage account, those qualified
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.660]   dividends would actually be taxed favorable tax treatment.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.900]   But for you in a high tax bracket, you're looking at either the 15% or 20% qualified
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.900]   dividends or long-term capital gains tax treatment, plus a 3.8% net investment income tax.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:22.620]   So a total of 23.8% if held within the taxable brokerage account versus being tax deferred,
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:29.700]   but potentially taxed at a much higher marginal tax rate, which could be 24, 32, 35, 37% when
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.420]   distributed from the IRA.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.620]   I guess the first thing is usually you want to take advantage of favorable qualified tax
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.500]   rates on those qualified dividends.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.700]   Secondary to that, though, I would say for people with high income, I prefer not to purchase
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.380]   high income paying investments in general, whether equity or fixed income, but rather
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.320]   take a total of return approach.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.460]   So on average, I prefer to keep the equities within the taxable brokerage accounts and
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.100]   Roth IRAs, right, because they receive that favorable tax treatment.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.700]   I know that you're in a higher bracket, but actually effectively the lowest capital gains
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.520]   tax rate is 0%.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.320]   So some people might call that tax gain harvesting rather than tax loss harvesting.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.240]   Usually I want to keep equities within the taxable brokerage accounts.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.920]   If there is fixed income, keep the fixed income within the pre-tax retirement account.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.360]   So based on your circumstance being in a high tax bracket, I'm not a big chaser of dividend
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.480]   yield to begin with.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   I'd most likely have my qualified dividends in the place where it's most favorable, which
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.260]   would be the taxable brokerage account, and then keep my IRA invested for the less favorable
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.580]   tax consequences.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:36.080]   Speaking of dividend investing, we interviewed Vanguard's Colleen Giaconetti on episode 26
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.180]   of the Booklet Edge live show, where we talk about just this, dividend investing, investing
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.620]   for income.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:48.220]   And Colleen sums it up as saying, "Investing for income means more risk and more taxes."
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.580]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.120]   They can check that out.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:00.300]   This question is from Dennis Lee from Facebook, who asks, "Should a person even bother trying
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.540]   to do a backdoor Roth if they have a fair amount of money in a traditional IRA from
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.500]   a previous 401k rollover?
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.180]   I've already tried to see if I can roll these into my solo 401k, and thus far I cannot."
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.180]   There's really two parts here.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.980]   The first is, should a person even try bothering doing a backdoor Roth if they have a fair
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:24.060]   amount of pre-tax money specifically in a traditional IRA from a previous 401k rollover?
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:29.540]   So if you do have access to a workplace retirement plan that's not an IRA, like a 401k, might
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.660]   allow incoming rollovers of that pre-tax portion.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.540]   This question is really talking about that pro-rata rule.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.460]   If you do a Roth conversion, the coffee and the cream is mixed within your traditional
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.620]   IRA, some pre-tax money, some after-tax cost basis, you're going to have this pro-rata
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.340]   calculation that you're actually going to end up paying more taxes to do that Roth conversion.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.420]   So first off, if you do have access to a qualified retirement plan, such as a 401k, that allows
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.740]   incoming rollovers, a lot of people do roll over the pre-tax portion into that.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.760]   So they're only left with their after-tax portion that can be converted tax-free.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.660]   That requires that pre-tax portion to be rolled into the typically a 401k by December 31st
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.540]   of the Roth conversion year.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.280]   The second part of this is you mentioned that you have a solo 401k and that you cannot roll
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.380]   over your IRA into it.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:19.620]   Actually, in the last few years, some solo 401k plans do allow incoming IRA rollovers.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.980]   Vanguard might be one of those that now allows incoming IRA rollovers into a solo 401k, also
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.460]   called a self-employed 401k.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.380]   But keep in mind, this is very plan specific.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.060]   So you mentioned that it's not available in your solo 401k, but it might be available
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.900]   in another solo 401k plan.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.140]   Really, look at the plan rules, verify if that's accurate.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.220]   If you cannot avoid the pro-rata taxation, it's typically not worth it if you have significant
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.900]   pre-tax balances.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:50.120]   Sometimes it's better to just avoid that hassle, we call it return on hassle.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.900]   So instead of putting money into there trying to do the backdoor Roth IRA, go ahead and
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.540]   just put that money into a taxable brokerage account instead.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.180]   There's a lot of great benefits to a taxable brokerage account.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.980]   I think the taxable brokerage account is just like one step under a Roth IRA.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.220]   There are so many incredible benefits of a taxable brokerage account, especially for
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.140]   early retirees, that if you're going to be subject to significant pro-rata taxation of
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.820]   the backdoor Roth IRA, I'd probably just say skip it.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:21.460]   This question comes from username Baddy Natty from the Bogleheads forums who writes, "When
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.820]   you encounter families who are planning to stop working in about five years, but already
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   have the savings to retire now, do you put together a plan to spend more than usual over
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:38.100]   the next five years to start maximizing experiences, memories, and happiness?"
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.420]   Absolutely yes.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.340]   Especially once a family is financially independent with the ability to work because they want
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.780]   to, not because they have to, they can significantly expand their current desired lifestyle while
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.420]   they're working.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.500]   This question mentions a family who has the savings to retire now, but they plan to stop
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.420]   working in about five years.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.780]   If they have enough savings to retire now, I'd really want to understand why five years.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.740]   Is there something they're anxious about?
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.180]   Maybe a limited belief that they have that they must do five more years because that's
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.220]   how long their dad worked or their mom worked.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.980]   There might be some behavioral, emotional things behind the scenes to really figure
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.180]   out why five years.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.500]   If you have enough money to retire now, why are you waiting?
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.380]   One great exercise that I do with clients, especially what you talk about here, is even
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:26.200]   while they're working, I created this blank calendar exercise to help pre-retirees recognize
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.980]   how they want to spend their time and energy as a family.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.540]   Imagine you have a seven-day, 24-hour blank calendar.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.260]   You take it as a family and you fill it out and say, "If we had a blank calendar, how
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.340]   do we want to spend time as a family?"
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.540]   They fill out that calendar.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.100]   Now, how can we plug in the numbers to this?
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.780]   Some things they said, "Hey, on Monday and Wednesday, we want to do a picnic at the park.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.420]   We want to go pick up sub sandwiches from our favorite sub shop down the street."
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.700]   The first question I ask is, "Is it possible to do that even now while you're still working?"
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.120]   Because a lot of the things that we want to do more of in retirement, there's actually
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.260]   nothing stopping us from doing it now.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.540]   But we somehow have this limited belief that, "Oh, you have to wait until you retire before
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.100]   you do the things you want to do."
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.820]   Cody, I love that calendar exercise.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.200]   That is phenomenal.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.340]   This question is from a user named Ariel Wombat from the Booklets Forums who writes, "I'm
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.100]   about two years into early retirement in my mid 40s.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.100]   What unknown unknowns do as fire clients experience five to 10 years into early retirement that
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.180]   they didn't anticipate financially or otherwise?"
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:35.460]   First of all, as I mentioned before, physical, mental, spiritual, relational, and financial
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.540]   wellness are interrelated.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.340]   Many early retirees don't realize until they retire that they've actually sacrificed their
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.420]   physical, mental, spiritual, and relational wellness for the sake of financial health
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.620]   along the way and aren't actually able to enjoy retirement as much as they expected.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.260]   So they have all the money they need in the world, but they don't have anybody to spend
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.260]   it with.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.700]   They don't have the mental capacity to spend it in a way that provides a lack of anxiety
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.700]   for them.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.540]   It provides joy and not just more stress.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.880]   Most people who plan to retire early don't consider the potential reality of becoming
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.400]   a caregiver in the future for other family members, their parents, their siblings.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.620]   So we assume that early retirement will look the same in year 10 as it does in year two,
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.100]   but it's going to be so different than what you expected.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.420]   To go along with that, think about what you were like and what your life was like 10 years
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.580]   ago.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.020]   If you think about how different you were and how different life was 10 years ago, but
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.340]   yet we somehow assume that 10 years from now, our life is going to look very similar to
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.340]   what it is today.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.820]   And we're going to be the same person in 10 years that we are today.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.780]   Once you realize that the way you assume you're going to be in the future is going to be completely
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.180]   different in reality, the biggest unknown, unknown that you're going to realize later
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.200]   on is that you're going to be a different person and you're also going to be caring
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.540]   differently for people.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.500]   A lot of people retiring early, their parents are actually going into traditional retirement.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.020]   Somebody's retiring at 40, their parents might be in their 60s or 70s retired.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:04.100]   And there might be a time in terms of long-term care, in terms of cognitive decline, that
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.980]   you might actually be spending not just your time and energy, but also your finances helping
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.780]   to support other people.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.500]   So before you retire early, especially financially, think about, will I need to financially support
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.860]   somebody in the future, including my own parents or my children?
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.980]   Even by the way, when my children are adults, there are plenty of adult children who still
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.020]   need time, energy, and financial resources from their parents.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.260]   What's IRR?
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.780]   From the Bogolets Forums writes, "Has Cody seen any trends with either successful or
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:40.700]   unsuccessful FIRE folks trying to get to FIRE?"
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.420]   There's actually a trend within the FIRE community of discovering within one to two years of
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.140]   early retirement that they actually miss aspects of working.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.200]   But thankfully, now that they have command over the who, what, where, when, why and how
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:59.180]   work is done, some early retirees end up actually going back to work, usually often as entrepreneurs
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.180]   as well.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.580]   They end up making more money when they're financially independent than when they had
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.660]   to work.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.980]   I've also seen patterns within the FIRE community of being financially successful, but unsuccessful
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.700]   in the non-financial areas.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.980]   So you talk about people being unsuccessfully FIRE, we're typically thinking about the financial
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.260]   part of FIRE.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.900]   I've seen a lot of people who are successful financially, but they're unsuccessful in those
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.940]   other ways that we've talked about, that they have all the money in the world, but every
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.220]   other part of their life is crumbling apart.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.180]   So again, that's just one more reason that on the path to FIRE, it's not just the path
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.660]   to FIRE, it's the path to continuing healthy relationships, continuing health, physical
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.660]   and mental.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.420]   A lot of times we've been kind of plugging our life into the numbers rather than plugging
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.100]   the numbers into our life.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.500]   So we're starting with the spreadsheet and saying, how can I live given my spreadsheet
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.360]   rather than how do I want to live and how can my spreadsheet support that?
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.740]   So on the path to and through early retirement, ask yourself, what do I visualize my ideal
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.700]   life looking like, and then only then plug in the numbers and say, "Hey, is that actually
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.980]   possible?"
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.020]   Rather than saying, "I have this much money, what can I do with it?"
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:12.040]   Most of the questions we receive are financial, where in reality, in retirement, most of your
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.340]   time is spent doing non-financial things, that by the way, just happen to require money
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   sometimes.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   Absolutely.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.300]   Money is a tool for our personal goals.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.980]   It is not the end goal.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.700]   Colm Stretch from the Vogelheids Forums writes, and he's got a bunch of questions here.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:36.020]   He writes, "Great topic, five years before retirement, should one change portfolio asset
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.020]   allocation?"
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.460]   I'm going to say yes to that.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.780]   Usually within five years before retirement, you're really starting to think about creating
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.380]   some short-term liquidity.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.180]   Some people choose like one, two, three years of short-term liquidity.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:53.100]   As mentioned before, three to five years of de-risking or de-risking the total portfolio,
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   if you're using that approach, you might have been 100% equity during your whole accumulation.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.820]   But if you're five years until retirement, you just start thinking about de-risking the
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:07.060]   total portfolio, whether just changing that overall asset allocation down from 100% equity
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.740]   or 80%, depending on your other income sources, certainly.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.380]   Start thinking ahead in five years, how much income will I need for my portfolio to supplement
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.980]   my other forms of income?
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.580]   And start really timing out, they call it asset liability matching.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.420]   What are my future liabilities going to be?
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   How can I turn my assets into income over the next five years?
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.140]   So that usually means creating some type of a bond ladder or just starting to put some
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.620]   bond allocation within your total portfolio.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.140]   So yes, five years before retirement, I would change the asset allocation, assuming that
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.060]   you hadn't changed it years before.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.960]   And I'll link to the Bogleheads wiki that talks about some basic considerations for
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.340]   investing and taking the right amount of risk.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.560]   That is part of it.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.680]   Five years before retirement, you certainly want to be taking the right amount of risk.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.840]   Not too much, not too little.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.860]   Question number two, should I, five years before retirement, build a cash balance or
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.260]   Roth ladder for early retirement?
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.940]   So to start, if you're not familiar, a Roth ladder, they're talking about a Roth conversion
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:05.940]   ladder.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.740]   So before 59 and a half, if you take money out of a qualified retirement plan before
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.580]   59 and a half, there's an additional 10% tax.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:19.980]   When you do a taxable Roth conversion from a pre-tax retirement account into a Roth tax-free
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.540]   retirement account, you have to wait five years before you can take that conversion
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.740]   amount back out to avoid that 10% penalty.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.380]   So the government doesn't want you just converting that money and taking it out right away.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.240]   They want to kind of penalize you for taking money out before traditional retirement ages
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.460]   of 59 and a half plus.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.120]   Should we build a cash balance or a Roth conversion ladder in early retirement?
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.420]   First of all, there's a misconception about the Roth conversion ladder.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.780]   Usually when somebody is using a Roth conversion ladder, they're usually only thinking about
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.680]   their future living expenses five years from now.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.320]   They're not thinking about also having to cover the tax liabilities from initiating
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.180]   those Roth conversions themselves.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.940]   So when you're doing a Roth conversion in early retirement before 59 and a half, you
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:07.700]   should not withhold the taxes from the conversions themselves because that portion that's withheld
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.100]   for taxes would be subject to the 10% penalty before 59 and a half.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:17.340]   So before early retirement, you typically want at least five years of liquidity to cover
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:22.660]   not just your living expenses, but also the tax liabilities needed to pay the taxes on
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.380]   your Roth conversions.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.380]   So if you're going to do a Roth conversion ladder in early retirement before 59 and a
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.460]   half, you need enough cash to sustain yourself for at least five years of living expenses,
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:38.300]   but also the five years of tax liabilities to make those conversions.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.460]   Question number three, while still in high marginal tax rate years, should one stop contributing
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:50.840]   to tax deferred accounts to save more cash or save in Roth accounts?
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.580]   So thinking about marginal versus effective tax rates here, marginal being, you know,
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.780]   what's the tax rate on your last dollar earned?
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.580]   That's the tax bracket we talk about 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35, 37.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.180]   Those are marginal tax rates.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.220]   But you also have what's called like an effective average tax rate.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.700]   So when you're contributing during your high marginal tax years, it's typically best to
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:18.220]   contribute pre-tax because you're either deducting or excluding that income at your highest marginal
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.680]   tax rate.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.740]   But in retirement, especially early retirement, you're probably distributing that income at
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:28.660]   much lower marginal tax rates or just a much lower effective average tax rate.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.820]   So in terms of this question, because we have the detail of being a high marginal tax rate
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.820]   year, usually you're going to want to contribute tax deferred rather than Roth, unless you're
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.460]   talking about, you know, the backdoor Roth, which is for high earners.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.500]   So typically you want to max out your pre-tax retirement accounts and higher earning years,
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.060]   then focus on building up taxable brokerage accounts.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.600]   So the backdoor and the mega backdoor Roths are great, but only if you don't have to touch
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.260]   the earnings in those accounts in early retirement, because you have to wait until 59 and a half
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.020]   to touch those earnings without tax or penalty.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.920]   The taxable brokerage account, again, is so undervalued within the FIRE community.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.900]   So once you max out those pre-tax accounts, think twice about whether or not you want
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:12.140]   to put money in Roth, or just build up some additional flexibility in cash and your taxable
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:17.820]   brokerage accounts, which have no 10% penalty for withdrawal before 59 and a half.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:23.780]   Credit to Jeff Levine for sharing something during a webinar he did for Team Kitsis once.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:29.300]   And Jeff made the point that sometimes it's just simpler to pay a 10% tax, quote unquote,
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   penalty.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:36.220]   So if this guy is in that higher marginal tax rate, let's say the 37% bracket, he makes
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:41.860]   that contribution today, gets that 37% deduction.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.140]   Now he's in retirement, he's going to be in the 0% bracket.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:52.140]   So 0% bracket plus 10% penalty, that is still a 27% savings compared to when he put that
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.340]   money in, compared to saving at the 37% rate today.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.900]   And to add to that, I think a lot of people start getting really excited about Roth at
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.580]   the end of their working career, and they start Roth conversions too early, or they
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.220]   start contributing to Roth too early.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.820]   I would say that if you're in your highest earning years and you're planning to retire
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.580]   early, and you're going to have lots of years to spread out the taxes of those conversions,
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.940]   you're much better off doing a traditional pre-tax contribution, not a Roth contribution.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.260]   And then a huge question for number four from Homestretch, how to plan for claiming Social
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:30.420]   Security, early retirement healthcare, Roth conversions, minimize IRMA, and higher marginal
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.640]   tax rates in later retirement after the start of RMDs.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.340]   I feel like we can do a whole episode on just that one question.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.340]   I love it.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.080]   So first of all, I did one note here is that the start of RMDs would usually happen after
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.660]   claiming Social Security.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:49.180]   But just to make it a simple answer here, if you retire before paying into Social Security
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:54.420]   for 35 years, you'll likely see decreased retirement benefits versus what your Social
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.040]   Security statement says before you retire.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.200]   Your Social Security statement assumes that you continue earning what you did last year
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.720]   through the age you claim benefits, whether it's 62, 67, full retirement age, 70, et cetera.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.900]   In terms of IRMA, IRMA is an increase in your Medicare Part B and D premiums.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.320]   Do not let IRMA be the tail that wags the dog.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.560]   If you're paying increased Medicare premiums through IRMA, that's a good problem to have
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.320]   because that means that your modified adjusted gross income is pretty high.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.420]   You can definitely afford the IRMA if your income is that high.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.860]   It is one of those shelves, right, where you don't want to go just a little bit over one
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   of those shelves.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.420]   But don't let IRMA be a big concern in retirement.
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.340]   And then lastly, early retirement health care.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:43.460]   As we mentioned before, the health insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov/c-plans, plus
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.640]   the use of those premium tax credits, if you can control your modified adjusted gross income
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.420]   in early retirement, that is really the best way to start with thinking about health care
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.060]   in early retirement.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.660]   And Cody mentioned, if you're looking at your social security statement for the benefit
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:03.700]   you may expect when you retire, he pointed out, you've got to work until that year to
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:09.660]   get a better idea of the ultimate social security benefit you might expect if retiring early.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.420]   You want to check out ssa.tools.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.700]   It's a pretty neat tool that helps you determine your future social security benefit amount,
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:23.420]   where it lets you toggle your future income and how long you plan to work for.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:28.300]   And it shows you what benefit you can expect at different claiming ages, pretty neat tool
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.300]   to check out.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:35.820]   And then lastly, five years before retirement, should one update estate planning docs?
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.820]   Simple answer here.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.420]   I think that you should review these documents every few years, and when any significant
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:47.260]   change occurs, such as a birth, a death, a move, a marriage, a divorce, or a changing
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.140]   family relationship.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.780]   Once you have, let's say, you know, your wills, your powers of attorney, your trust in place,
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.980]   review those every few years, if kind of life is normal.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:59.120]   But if any of those significant changes happen, that's when you should at least review your
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.620]   estate documents to figure out whether or not they should be updated.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.500]   So it's not necessarily five years before retirement, update your estate documents,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.460]   just you should be doing this regularly throughout your life.
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.740]   Absolutely well said, Cody.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.020]   Private ID from the Vogelites forums writes, when to start social security for the lower
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.560]   earner?
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.020]   So I'm assuming you're saying a lower earner means that there's spouses.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.020]   One was a higher earner, which means that they're going to have a higher benefit and
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.660]   a lower earner, which means they're going to have a lower social security retirement
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.660]   benefit.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.340]   In general, the lower earner typically is going to claim earlier if they do claim earlier.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:38.340]   That's because once one of the spouses dies, the surviving spouse will continue the higher
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.700]   of the two benefits.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.500]   So the lower earner will typically claim earlier.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.060]   But with that said, there are many variables that exist here, including life expectancy,
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:53.140]   age difference, other income sources, multigenerational wealth objectives, charitable giving intentions.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.940]   There's a lot that goes into this question.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.740]   But just to tell you in general, yes, if anybody is going to claim earlier, it's typically
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.840]   going to be the lower earner.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.740]   And unsaid by this question and unsaid by Cody is that generally for the higher earner,
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.820]   you're going to delay until 70.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.620]   That's going to give that lower earner, if they live longer than the higher earner at
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.780]   higher earners benefit.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.100]   That's a great point, John.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.500]   So that begs the question, when does the lower earner claim?
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.900]   Mike Piper and I talked about this on episode 23 of the Booklet's live show.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.900]   You can check that out.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.540]   I will link to that in the show notes.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.500]   And then Mike Piper has a pretty neat tool, Open Social Security, that allows you to play
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.460]   with different claiming strategies.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.580]   One to have that lower earner claim earlier versus later.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:43.220]   And that can show you the dollar amount difference you might expect for claiming earlier versus
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.220]   later.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:49.580]   That will help your household decide what might be the right strategy for you.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:54.520]   I'll link to that Open Social Security calculator by Mike Piper in the show notes as well as
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.020]   that podcast episode for folks to check out to learn more.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.900]   Private ID goes on to say question number three, insurance, my company's retirement
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.820]   plan or ACA with potential subsidies.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.280]   So continuing coverage through your company's plan.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.940]   Sometimes they might offer COBRA up to 18 months typically.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:19.260]   Typically that group plan may provide better coverage, but is typically really expensive
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.580]   because not only are you paying the employee side that you were paying before, but now
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.260]   you're taking over the employer premiums too.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:30.460]   So you're typically paying 102% of the combined employee employer premiums.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.620]   So some people stay on COBRA for a little while.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.060]   Maybe they've already hit their max out of pocket or they're deductible for the year.
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.820]   They want to continue at least the rest of that year with their current health plan.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.580]   But otherwise, if you do have control over taxable income in early retirement, especially
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.540]   the Affordable Care Act, the ACAs they talk about, that's the healthcare marketplace with
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.620]   those premium tax credits is usually the better bet.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.620]   Just keep in mind that it's not just about the money.
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.700]   You know, think about your healthcare needs.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.540]   Think about your prescription drugs.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:00.780]   Also, don't just jump to doing a high deductible health plan just because you've heard that's
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   a thing worth doing.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.600]   A high deductible health plan with an HSA is a great tool, but only if it actually makes
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.100]   sense for your health specifically and your family's health.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.660]   One benefit to using workplace plan is that you don't have to worry about keeping your
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:18.060]   income low to maximize those ACA subsidies, which leaves you a better opportunity for
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.620]   those partial Roth conversions.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.380]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.300]   And also, just another reminder that some people wish COBRA could last forever, but
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.680]   typically, yes, again, it's typically only limited to 18 months.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:34.020]   This question is from Work to Live from the Bullhead's Forums who writes, "My question
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:40.020]   is how to plan for and estimate tax expenses in retirement given those of us who have been
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.740]   placing retirement assets in a diversified basket of tax-free, tax-averted, and taxable
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:45.740]   accounts.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:51.500]   I have no idea to even begin planning for my tax expenses."
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:56.500]   I recommend learning the difference simply between marginal and effective tax rates,
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:01.420]   the difference between adjusted gross income, AGI, and taxable income, right?
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.580]   So that's really understanding how the standard deduction works, and the benefits of taxable
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.900]   brokerage accounts, so including the qualified dividends, the long-term capital gain tax
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.420]   treatment, tax-optimized charitable giving, for example, itemized deductions, the use
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.660]   of donor-advised funds, things like that.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.060]   Once you understand the tax formula and consider your distribution order of operations that
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.220]   we covered earlier, that typically is going to include the taxable, pre-tax, and then
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.860]   tax-free accounts.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:31.120]   Then you can gain some clarity around your average effective retirement tax rate.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.740]   Most of the assumptions that we make will actually not come true because most of the
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.540]   things that we optimize for are out of our control rather than things that are within
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.540]   our control.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:43.900]   So try not to over-optimize and estimate what your electricity bill will be in 30 years
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.260]   from now, for example.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.020]   Don't optimize for the 20% leaving the 80% on the table.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.380]   So visualize your long-term projections, but then step back.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.180]   Again, take one year at a time.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.260]   Most of the decisions we make in retirement aren't permanent, so you don't have to have
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:05.060]   a plan for estimating how much taxes you'll owe over the next 20, 30 years.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.380]   Just continue to improve your education.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.620]   I know the Boglehut forum, for example, that you wrote this question on has great educational
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:12.200]   insights and resources.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.420]   Just continue learning and give yourself some grace and compassion that you don't have to
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.860]   know everything.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:23.740]   This one is from username USAFPerio, who writes, "I'm four and a half years out from my military
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.740]   retirement.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.740]   I'll be 51.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:32.380]   And with my pension, with a cola, and my portfolio, I'll be financially independent and not needing
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.980]   to work again for money.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.020]   The only big downside is we haven't owned a home in many years, and therefore we have
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.700]   no home equity.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:45.100]   Can you comment on what I should be considering as I plan to finally purchase a home, such
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.220]   as paying in full versus taking out a mortgage in retirement?
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:53.000]   I could pay for a home outright from my brokerage account, but it would be a big capital gains
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.600]   tax hit, although I'm enamored by the idea of having no mortgage payments."
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.400]   Interest rates have been like really going up.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.960]   Mortgage rates are now at a place where people are starting to think, "Maybe I pay off my
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.040]   mortgage early."
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.640]   You're enamored by the idea of having no mortgage payment, but you're worried about capital gains
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.080]   tax hit.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:16.940]   It could make sense for you to finance a mortgage, but pay it off more aggressively than minimally.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.860]   So looking at a 15-year versus a 30-year, I'm actually a fan of a 30-year mortgage,
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.080]   but paid off within 15 years.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:30.160]   I actually have a mortgage flexibility calculator showing if you get a 15-year mortgage or a
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.320]   30-year mortgage.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.440]   Or scenario three is, what if I get a 30-year mortgage, but paid off in 15 years?
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.920]   Because of the change in interest rate between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, you might
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.560]   be paying for that opportunity cost, but it provides some breadth and flexibility in your
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.780]   payments moving forward.
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:50.160]   Because it's very hard to turn a 15-year mortgage into a 30-year mortgage, but it's very easy
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.840]   to turn a 30-year mortgage into a 15.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   It probably makes sense to get the longer mortgage, but pay it off aggressively, especially
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.320]   given your situation.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.440]   Yeah, I think about, I'm enamored by the idea of having no mortgage payment, but it would
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   be a big capital gains tax hit.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.480]   I just go back to money is a tool.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.920]   It's not the end goal.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.400]   If you're going to feel good about having no mortgage payment, and I won't even go down
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.840]   the nerd rabbit hole of sequence risk and borrowing at 7% to invest in bonds paying
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.600]   at 4.5%, but again, money is a tool.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.520]   If you can use money to feel better, and certainly it's not unreasonable in this scenario, that's
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.680]   certainly something worth considering, taxes aside.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.380]   I love that you mentioned their preference for not having no mortgage.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.600]   This could also mean getting a mortgage, but paying off the house within one year, but
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.320]   splitting that capital gains tax hit into two years rather than just one.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:50.240]   Dave learning more from the Volgas forums writes, does Cody help folks develop a backup
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:55.200]   plan to reenter the workforce in case of a fire failure?
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.640]   That is a big portion of their budget for conferences to maintain skills, or at least
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.000]   advised to keep up their professional contacts.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.560]   So both risk management and flexibility are fundamental tenets within the fire community.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.580]   If you're retiring from a profession that requires a lot of continued education to avoid
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:18.300]   losing your license, you may want to spend the money and continue your education just
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.440]   to keep that license just in case you have to go back to work.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.840]   By the way, not just financially, but you might be three years into early retirement
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   and realize, you know what?
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   I really miss my career.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.060]   I would actually love to do that career.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.800]   We've got another question from want to retire early.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:38.120]   How to avoid the regret of waiting too long to retire and what are the telltale signs?
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:44.220]   Not a partner with your spouse, so you are on the same page for early retirement.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.100]   So in terms of regret of waiting too long to retire, what are the signs?
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.900]   First of all, know your numbers.
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:55.080]   Consider how you'd manage risk and this is a big part, embrace uncertainty and self-compassion.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.360]   So the fear of retiring usually isn't about the money.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.900]   There are deeper cognitive issues and opportunities there.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.180]   One way to regret waiting too long is if you're on the fence of like, I don't know if I'm
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:11.380]   ready to retire or not, this is actually a good time to hire a counselor or a therapist.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.020]   Having a mental health professional in your life is just as important as hiring a financial
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.740]   planner or listening to the Boglehead podcast.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.380]   So part of your education should be not just learning about money, learning about your
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.820]   money, but learning more about yourself.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.460]   So invest in your mental health.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.140]   By the way, if you don't already invest in your mental health in terms of your time,
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.020]   energy and finances, just really, really consider that.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.620]   And also if it helps, like just go beyond the stigma of that.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.580]   Like I see a counselor once a week and I think it's really important for us even in the profession
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.620]   to be vulnerable about the need for mental health services.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:48.500]   So the telltale signs are when financial planning software says 100% "probability of success"
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:53.260]   even with conservative assumptions, but yet pre-retirees, they don't want to believe it.
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.100]   They're like, there's no way that's true.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.100]   There's no way that I can retire.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.840]   Like there must be something wrong with the software, right?
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.920]   And not only that, a telltale sign is with confirmation bias, pre-retirees, they're often
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.380]   seeking out fear-driven financial and political media.
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:10.980]   I'm sure we all know that person who, you know, they're on the fence of retiring or
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   not.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.140]   And they're spending all their time watching investment news, reading every article they
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.660]   can about, you know, this is how much you need to retire.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:21.620]   So if you see yourself going down a rabbit hole, almost having confirmation bias or trying
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.780]   to find something that supports your fear of not retiring.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:29.140]   If you're reading articles about how you need $4 million to retire no matter who you are,
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.660]   like that's a telltale sign, you know, not just going too deep, but you're also, you're
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.540]   probably ready to retire.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.640]   And lastly, take away the numbers for a minute, right?
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.920]   So talk about and visualize your family's ideal life together.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.520]   And then only then should you explore how your current and future financial situation
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.680]   can support that mutual vision.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.800]   You talk about your spouse, this conversation usually goes sideways when one spouse wants
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.640]   the other spouse to be on their page, not on the same page.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.780]   So I hear all the time people say, Hey, like, how can I get my spouse on the same page in
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.440]   terms of being on a path to early retirement?
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.000]   When you say same page, what you're really saying is how can I get them on my page?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.900]   And it really takes stepping back and understanding that they have a vision of their ideal life
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.900]   as well.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.120]   So let them create a vision for their ideal life.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.480]   Only then plug in the money, plug in all the ideas you have about, you know, how to get
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.240]   on the path to early retirement.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   And it'll help.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.960]   And by the way, listen, don't talk is the best advice I can give when trying to get
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.480]   a spouse on the same page.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   Great advice, Cody.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.040]   Well, I can't say that my wife and I did early retirement.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.200]   We did do a sabbatical gap year, we took roughly a year off to do some traveling.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:43.600]   And that just started with us having a conversation about it, making a couple dates to talk about
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.120]   what that would look like.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.880]   So just talking about it, that was the first step.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:52.080]   Cody, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.320]   Any final thoughts before I let you go?
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:00.240]   I've got to say, I actually have a trademark this phrase, it's keep finance personal.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.280]   We're all personal finance nerds.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:07.240]   We're all listening to all the podcasts, we're reading all the articles about "personal finance,"
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.020]   but keep finance personal.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:14.000]   What this means is when you think about the advice somebody else is giving you, even the
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.560]   stuff I said today, right?
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.960]   I do not understand your personal situation, or most people giving you advice are only
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:24.200]   giving advice based on their circumstance and how they think about things and their
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.200]   biases.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.080]   So when you're making financial decisions, when you're gaining financial education, keep
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.920]   finance personal, always think about whose financial plan is this?
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.880]   Is this the financial plan of the person writing the article?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.040]   Really think any time I consume financial information, how does this actually apply
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   to me?
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.040]   A good example of this.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.800]   So John, you live in California, right?
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.160]   Yep, San Diego.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.840]   So if I asked you, John, "Hey, where should I go to lunch today?"
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.200]   You might say, "Oh, you should go to In-N-Out Burger."
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.580]   And I would be like, "Well, I don't have In-N-Out Burger where I live."
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.720]   You gave me advice on where to go to lunch based on where you could go to lunch, not
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.120]   based on where I could go to lunch.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.320]   So keep in mind that when people are giving you financial advice, they're saying what
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.520]   they would do, not what you should do based on your own.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.600]   There's two parts to this, your comprehensive financial ecosystem and your unique values
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.680]   and desired outcomes as a family.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.480]   Recognize, understand the numbers, understand your values and desired outcomes before you
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.680]   start asking other people for advice.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]   Wonderful.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   Thank you, Cody.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.820]   Cody, I'm super excited to meet you at the Bullets Conference this year.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.320]   Folks will get to meet Cody and all sorts of amazing guests we're going to have this
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.800]   year at the 2023 conference.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.960]   It's going to be in Maryland, October 13th through the 15th, boglescenter.net/2023conference.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.560]   We've got around 60 spots left to register as of this recording.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.680]   So make sure to grab your spot before we are full up.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.160]   Cody, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.160]   Absolutely.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.160]   Anytime.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.680]   And that wraps up our interview with Cody Garrett.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.720]   And depending upon how long it takes for the last few spots of the conference to fill up,
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.520]   you might still have a chance to register for the 2023 Bogleheads Conference.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.840]   Go to boglescenter.net/2023conference for more information.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.280]   I'll be back next month returning as guest host for the Bogleheads on investing podcast.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.800]   It'll be my final month covering for Rick Perry before I returned to our live Twitter
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.560]   series for the Bogleheads.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.960]   Until next month, you can check out a wealth of information for do-it-yourself investors
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.440]   at the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy at boglescenter.net.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:37.560]   And check out Bogleheads.org, Bogleheads Twitter, Bogleheads Wiki, the Bogleheads YouTube channel,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.280]   Bogleheads Facebook, Bogleheads Reddit, the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.420]   on LinkedIn, and local and virtual chapters.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:52.800]   And a thank you to all the folks who helped make this possible, including Nathan Garza,
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.600]   our podcast editor, and Jeremy Zook, our podcast transcriber.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.800]   I could not do it without their help.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.880]   And finally, this is my plea.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:10.120]   We had over 20,000 downloads per episode over the last few months.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.340]   If we could just get some of those folks to leave a review, subscribe, and to rate the
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:21.780]   show, that'll help more folks find this resource for do-it-yourself investors.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.580]   Thank you again for checking out this episode of the Bogleheads on investing podcast.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.380]   Until next month for our next show, have a great one.
