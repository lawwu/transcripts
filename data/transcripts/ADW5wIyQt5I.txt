[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 26 and verse 25.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.000]   The 25th verse in the 26th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, which we
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.240]   read at the beginning.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:30.680]   But he, Paul, said, "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.520]   and soberness."
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:43.460]   I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:54.160]   This is admittedly one of the great dramatic chapters of the Bible, containing an account
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.760]   of this famous interview between the apostle Paul, the servant of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.380]   Christ, and the Roman governor Festus, and King Agrippa, and their wives, and the members
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.040]   of the court.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.960]   It is one of the great dramatic scenes of all history, often commented upon, often painted.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.380]   And it is not surprising, because you have gathered together in this one chapter all
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:40.000]   the elements and ingredients which are necessary to a great and a famous and a dramatic occasion.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.820]   And one cannot but express one's admiration for the extraordinary manner in which the
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.540]   scene is presented to us by Luke, who is undoubtedly the recorder and historian of this famous
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.540]   happening.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:06.720]   But this evening I am concerned not to call your attention merely to the dramatic character
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.020]   of the incident.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:18.160]   We must of necessity be interested in it as it presents to us the truth, because that
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.440]   is really the message of this great chapter.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.160]   It reminds us of the essential Christian message, and at the same time it reminds us of the
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.080]   way in which men and women react to that message.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.920]   In other words, we have in this chapter an account of what is happening at this very
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.080]   moment in this service.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.680]   I have the privilege of standing before you to preach and to present to you the gospel
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.800]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and you are listening to it.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.200]   In exactly the same way, the Apostle Paul presented it to this distinguished company,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.120]   and they listened to it.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.920]   So you have here, at one and the same time, the presentation of the message, we are reminded
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.040]   of what the message is in its essence, and we are shown how people, different people,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   respond to it and react to it.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.720]   Now we are shown that in a number of instances.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.240]   We are actually shown it all in the case of the Apostle Paul himself, because here he
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.560]   indulges in a bit of autobiography.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.120]   He had to do so.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.880]   He was on trial, he was a prisoner, and he has to justify himself and his position.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200]   He was asked to do so, so he has to do so.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.440]   And so he tells them about himself, how at one time he was a bitter opponent of the Christian
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.080]   message.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.400]   He hated the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he stood for and all that was claimed for
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.360]   him, and he considered that he was doing God's service when he did his utmost to exterminate
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   Christians and Christianity.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.960]   He was once a man who reacted violently against this gospel.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.300]   But then he goes on to tell us how he became a believer in it, and how he not only became
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.940]   a believer in it, but a preacher of it, and how he had spent his time ever after traveling
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.960]   backwards and forwards in different countries preaching this gospel that he had once revived.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.080]   Now there it is all in one man, you see.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.440]   The same message, first of all disliked and rejected, then believed and gloried in and
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   preached.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:57.020]   Then, of course, we've got these other examples and illustrations which are provided by Festus
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.360]   and King Agrippa and so on.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.680]   Now the interesting thing one must notice, of course, is this, that the apostle, once
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   he had become a Christian and a preacher of the gospel, began to find people doing exactly
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.600]   the same thing with his presentation of the message as he had done previously with the
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.540]   message as it had come to him.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.860]   And here it is, I say, all put before us.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:33.020]   He finds repeated in other people the same attitude, the same reaction, the same position
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.940]   exactly as he himself had formerly occupied and of which he was formerly guilty.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.520]   Now it's about all that I want to speak to you this evening, because this gospel is something
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.040]   that always produces a response.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.480]   You can't listen to this without reacting to it, and there are only two possible reactions.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.980]   You either believe in it and come to see it's the most wonderful thing in the world, or
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.940]   else you reject it.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.220]   Well now, the tragedy still is that there are large numbers of people who reject it,
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.060]   even as they did at the beginning, as Saul of Tarsus once did, and as this distinguished
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.820]   company did on this famous occasion.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.700]   Now there are many reasons which people give for their rejection of the gospel.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.340]   Several of them are mentioned in this one chapter.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.340]   There are some who have no interest in the gospel because they think they are already
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.900]   religious.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.240]   That was the position of Saul of Tarsus.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.120]   He was very keen on what he called the Jews' religion, and because he thought that that
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.960]   Jews' religion was right, he disliked this.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   This was an upstart religion to him.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.300]   This Jesus of Nazareth was a blasphemer.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.680]   He had no right to speak at all about God.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680]   Who was he?
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.940]   He wasn't a Pharisee after all, and had never had any training.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.940]   He was an imposter.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.740]   "No," said Saul of Tarsus, "the true religion is the Jews' religion I've already got, and
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.480]   I don't want this other religion talking about a crucified Savior, and a physical resurrection,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.520]   and a new birth of the Spirit."
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.320]   There are still many people like that.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.680]   They reject the true gospel because they're religious.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.240]   They've got their own little religion.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.880]   It's a man-made religion, as the Jews' religion was, but they've got it, and because they
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.520]   think that's the right way, they have no use for this gospel, and they hate it, and they
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.800]   detest it.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.040]   That's a strange thing, isn't it?
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.920]   But it's very true.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.480]   You will find, if you read the long history of the Christian church, and especially of
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:00.740]   the saints, that it is less often the case that those who are religious within the church
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:07.280]   have been the foremost persecutors of the true Reformers and the prophets of God.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.160]   Religion can cause people to reject the Christian gospel.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.720]   That's one.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.960]   Another one that is mentioned here is this, that some people reject it, because, as they
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.640]   would put it, they feel that it is scientifically impossible.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.120]   Paul puts that in these words, "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.520]   that God should raise the dead?"
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.920]   Now, you see, there were certain people, even two thousand years ago, who said, "We can't
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.880]   possibly believe this gospel, because the very center and basis of this gospel is that
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.680]   what they call, the one they call Jesus of Nazareth, the Lord Jesus Christ, was raised
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   from the dead."
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.360]   Well, they said, "That's good enough.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.840]   You needn't go any further.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.340]   That's impossible.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.720]   No one can be raised from the dead.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.800]   It is an utter impossibility."
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.760]   So Paul says, "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   raise the dead?"
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.600]   But to these people it was incredible.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.280]   It just did not happen, and therefore it hadn't happened, and there was no need to say any
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   more.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   And there are thousands like that this evening.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.680]   But they say, "Your gospel, it's a patent impossibility.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.080]   It's full of miracles."
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.560]   And we know very well that miracles don't happen.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   Science proves that.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   A miracle is an impossibility.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.200]   It's therefore incredible.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.760]   That's the attitude.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   Resurrection of the dead.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.000]   Who's ever seen a dead corpse suddenly standing up and speaking?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Impossible.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Incredible.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.200]   Therefore, they have nothing to do with it.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.080]   There are thousands like that this evening.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.400]   It is a thing to them incredible that God should raise the dead.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.440]   "It's all right," says the man.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.040]   "You know, I have to approach these things as a scientist.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.000]   I'm trained scientifically.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I'm not a poet.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.720]   I don't indulge in fantasies and so on.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.000]   My approach, of course, is the scientific one.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.080]   And having this approach, and as I am accustomed to things I can see and measure and so on,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.320]   well, of course, the whole thing is put out of court at the very beginning.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   Impossible."
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.680]   That's another reason.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.880]   And then there is a third reason mentioned in this chapter, and I'm only dealing with
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.040]   the ones mentioned here.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.360]   I'm not going any further this evening.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:37.920]   The third one is, of course, the view that regards being Christian as a psychological
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.920]   condition.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:46.880]   Represented, you see, by Festus, who suddenly interrupted Paul with a loud voice and said,
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.760]   "Paul, thou art beside thyself.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.920]   Much learning doth make thee mad.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   Paul, you're raving," he said.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.800]   "Man, you're beside yourself.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.120]   You've become a psychological case.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.680]   You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   You're inventing things.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.640]   You're seeing things.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   You're talking about visions and appearances and resurrections and so on and so forth.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.440]   Paul, this is nonsense.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.240]   I admit you're a great man and you're a very learned man, but like many a similar man before
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.520]   you, you've spent so much time with your books and your learning and your meditations and
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.000]   contemplations, you've just gone mad.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.360]   You've become a psychological case, man."
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.200]   The terminology has changed, but the attitude is still the same in the case of large numbers
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   of people.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.240]   "Ah," they say, "he's got the religious complex.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.920]   It's a psychological trouble, this.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.920]   He's gone soft."
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:54.760]   Good men, no doubt, and unable men, well, yes, but you see, no man is perfect and, well,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.040]   for some reason or other, it may have been the stress of life or he may have been studying
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.600]   too hard or something or some strange influences have been brought to bear upon him.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.240]   He's just lost his balance a little.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.560]   He's prepared to believe anything now.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   Swallows miracles.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.440]   Believe anything you like to put before him.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.080]   He indulges in fantasies.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.440]   He's just become a psychological case.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.920]   Now, that's been a very common attitude in this century, as you know.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.200]   And of course, the psychologists come to us and they say, "Of course, we don't want to
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   be unkind.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.040]   We don't want to be unfair, but of course, with our psychological knowledge, we do know
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.080]   that people have these different complexes."
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.160]   And that's a common one.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.000]   At least it was a very common one, but as we are becoming more balanced and trained
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.320]   and educated and scientific, we suffer less and less from complexes.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.640]   So Christianity is on the way out.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   It's waning.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   It's disappearing.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.440]   The churches are empty and so on.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.920]   The whole thing was always psychological.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.040]   The primitive people imagined things and they saw spirits in stones and trees and in the
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.960]   stars and people have always been ready to invent these fantasies and so on.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.520]   But as we are becoming more enlightened, we are moving out of it.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.600]   Well, there are some of the reasons.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:24.280]   But now it seems to me that the whole point of this great chapter is just to say this,
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:31.800]   that while different people give different reasons in that way for their not being Christian
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:43.440]   and for their rejection of the Christian faith, in fact, there are only two reasons why anybody
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.960]   is not a Christian.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.000]   They'll give you a thousand and one and it'll be a different one from case to case, but
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.280]   there's a common denominator.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:02.200]   In fact, actually, there are only two reasons why people are not Christian and they are
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.120]   the two that are mentioned in my text this evening.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   Listen to them.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:17.160]   But Paul said, "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.320]   and soberness."
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.440]   Truth and soberness.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.080]   Now let's look at them together.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:39.960]   Men and women, I say, who are not Christians are in that position, first of all, because
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:47.800]   they have failed to realize that Christianity is a matter of truth, facts.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.680]   That's what the apostle means, you see, he's interrupted suddenly in his speech, in his
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.240]   address by Festus.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.160]   "Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad."
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:06.640]   "No, no, most noble Festus," says Paul, "I'm not mad, I'm not beside myself.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.040]   I am not seeing things and imagining things, I'm not raving.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.880]   I am speaking the words of truth."
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.440]   Now what's he mean by this?
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.960]   Well let me put it to you in this form.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:31.000]   His case is that he is dealing with facts, with historical facts.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.120]   That's what he means by truth.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.200]   He's just been giving them a number of facts.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.440]   He says, "I'm not raving, I'm not imagining or seeing things, I'm simply reciting historical
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   facts, events."
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.200]   Now this, I say, is the first reason why people are not Christians, they haven't realized
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   that.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:59.040]   They've somehow started off with the idea that this Christianity is mainly a matter
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   of teaching.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.640]   It's a matter of a theory.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.080]   It's a matter of a philosophy or a view of life.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:13.200]   You ask the average person, stop anybody and ask them at random, "What's a Christian?
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.960]   What's your idea of a Christian?"
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.480]   And you'll probably find they'll say something like that, "Well, Christianity is that which
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.880]   takes a given view of life.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.720]   It's a teaching.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   It's a philosophy.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.720]   It's a point of view.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.720]   It's a theory."
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:34.600]   Or they may say that it's just a matter of a number of religious ideas.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.720]   Like the Old Testament, the Jews' religion, there were religious ideas.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.600]   Paul had got his religious ideas, and people think that this is just a question of religious
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.280]   ideas.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.120]   They say, "Of course, all the great religions are much the same.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.600]   They've all got a common denominator, a common factor.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.160]   They differ on the surface, but essentially all religions are the same.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.760]   They're all religious."
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.520]   So they put Christianity in series with Hinduism and Buddhism and Confucianism and so on and
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.360]   so forth.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:13.560]   Or there are many who seem to think that it's just a matter of feeling.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   What is to be Christian?
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.440]   Well, to be Christian, they think, is to have a good feeling inside you, to feel friendly,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   to feel loving, to feel kind, to feel well-disposed towards people, to hate war, to be generally
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.320]   nice and benevolent and helpful.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.800]   And there are many, it seems to me, who regard even the business of the Christian church
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.560]   as being just something that promotes that sort of feeling within people, so that when
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.200]   they come to a service such as this, what they expect is to be made to feel happier
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.760]   than they were before, or to feel nicer.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.440]   They don't expect to have a number of facts put before them, no, but perhaps a story or
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.840]   two and some affecting incident, and you get a nice, comfortable feeling.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.760]   And well, it's all right while it lasts, but then you go back into the great world
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.480]   with its problems, and of course you've soon lost it again.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.600]   It's just a matter of feeling.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.080]   And then there are large numbers who seem to think that it's just a question of doing
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.920]   good or of being good, and that the whole business of Christian preaching is just to
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:27.720]   plead with people to be good, and to do good, and to stop doing that which is bad and evil,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.080]   and to appeal to people to pull together for the sake of the country, or for the sake of
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.600]   humanity, or for the sake of the world, and so on and so forth.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.920]   A great moral appeal, and nothing more.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.840]   But my friends, while there is an element of truth in all those things, that's not
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840]   Christianity.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.040]   You can have all that without Christianity.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.840]   Other religions can give you that.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.680]   The cults can give you that.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.760]   What is it that makes Christianity Christianity?
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:06.040]   The apostle Paul tells us facts, history, truth.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.680]   I'm not romancing, he says, I'm not philosophizing.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.080]   I am stating sober facts.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.240]   And he's already been rehearsing some of them to them.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.800]   And my dear friends, if you and I go from this service tonight without facing certain
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:31.320]   historical facts, we have not faced Christianity or the Christian message.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.680]   You know, the Bible is not a book of moral exhortation, it's a book of facts.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.320]   It's a book that tells us that God created the world out of nothing.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.660]   That's a fact.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.960]   It tells us that he created men and put them in the world, that's a fact.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.260]   It tells us that men sinned in his folly and went wrong, and brought chaos down upon himself
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.360]   and his world, that's a fact.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.880]   And we are living witnesses of it, every one of us.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.520]   That's what the Bible is talking about.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.840]   It's a book of facts.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.600]   And on and on the story goes.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:10.800]   Individuals, people, a flood, a tower of Babel, a man called Abram, heir of the Chaldees,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:18.360]   coming out, given a name called Canaan, son born to him called Isaac, he has two sons,
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.720]   Jacob and Esau.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.240]   History, facts.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.280]   That's what it's about.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.040]   And there is no Christianity apart from these facts.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.000]   And on and on the facts go.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.120]   How God kept on speaking to these people and saying, "Yes, you're in trouble and your
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:43.720]   world's in trouble and everything is sinful, but I'm going to do something about it.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:49.800]   I've made this world and I'm still interested in this world, and I'm going to send a deliverer
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.040]   into this world."
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.880]   He kept on promising it.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:59.360]   And eventually we come to the New Testament and again it's full of facts.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   What's Christianity about?
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.200]   I'll tell you.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:09.120]   Christianity starts with this, the birth of a babe in a place called Bethlehem.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.680]   That's Christianity.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.400]   It's not an idealistic view of life.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.820]   It's not that I feel nice and comfortable and feel that I'm going to be a little bit
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.300]   better than I've been in the past.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.600]   You can have all that without Christianity.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.880]   Christianity starts by saying this, "Look here, did you know that nearly 2,000 years
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:38.460]   ago in a little place called Bethlehem and in a stable, a child was born, born to a virgin
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.960]   who wasn't married, who hadn't a human father.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.920]   And they called him Jesus and put him in a manger."
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.160]   That's the beginning of Christianity.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.640]   And then the story goes on to tell us how this child grew and all about him.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.400]   It tells us how he was there in the temple at the age of 12, showing an amazing knowledge
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.320]   which the doctors of the law couldn't be equal.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.880]   An amazing boy, this.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.240]   And then how for 18 years he worked as a carpenter and we know very little about that time.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.400]   And then at the age of 30, he began to preach.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.140]   He went to John the Baptist and said, "I want to be baptized."
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.600]   And John the Baptist said, "You want to be baptized?
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.560]   I ought to be baptized by you, not you by me."
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.120]   "No, no," he said, "suffer it to be so now, for thus it behoveth us to fulfill all
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.480]   righteousness."
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.040]   And he was baptized.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.960]   And as he came up out of the water, the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   dove.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   That's what Christianity is about, facts.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.320]   That's what you've got in your four gospels, isn't it?
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.700]   He preached.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.680]   He expounded God's law.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.560]   He worked miracles.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.040]   It's a part of the story.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.840]   These are all facts.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:08.680]   And then after three years of it, he'd aroused so much antagonism and enmity and bitterness
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.040]   on the part of the Pharisees and scribes and the Sadducees and the doctors of the law that
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.480]   they conspired to get rid of him.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.960]   They arrested him and took him before the Roman governor.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.920]   And eventually, after a most shocking trial with no evidence against him at all, they
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.080]   condemned him.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.520]   And they nailed him to a tree.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.080]   And he died.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.500]   And they took down his body and they put it in a grave.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.320]   And they rolled a stone onto the face of that grave.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.880]   And then, because they were afraid that his followers might come and steal the body and
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.160]   say that he'd some way or other risen from the dead, they said, "Seal it.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.560]   Put a seal there and put soldiers to guard."
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.200]   And they did that.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.420]   Facts.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.440]   But in spite of that, he rose out of that grave.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.120]   So that when they went to look for him in the grave, he wasn't there.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.240]   They found the grave clothes.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.880]   But him they didn't find.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.960]   He'd risen.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.040]   And he manifested himself for forty days to certain chosen persons.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.680]   And then some of them, while he was speaking to them on the top of a mountain, saw him
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:31.160]   rising to heaven and disappearing.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:39.240]   And then, in seven weeks, when a number of them were gathered together in Jerusalem,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.920]   suddenly the place in which they were was shaken.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.000]   And cloven tongues as of fire descended upon them.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.120]   And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.120]   And were transformed and began to preach.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.360]   That's what Christianity is about.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.840]   That's the kind of thing that Saul of Tarsus had been hearing.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.320]   That's the sort of thing he hated.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.600]   But he'd heard it.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.160]   The facts had been reported to him.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.920]   That is Christianity, I say.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.440]   It is essentially a matter of history.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.240]   It's a matter of concrete facts.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.720]   Those things have literally taken place.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   Now that's the first proposition, but let me come to the second.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.120]   These facts are well-attested facts.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.760]   Now the apostle brings that out by putting it like this, you notice.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.840]   He says, "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and of
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.840]   soberness.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.440]   For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.720]   For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   For this thing was not done in a corner."
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:03.360]   This thing being the crucifixion and the burial and the resurrection of our Lord and Savior
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.280]   Jesus Christ and all the other facts about it.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.720]   This thing wasn't done in a corner.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.000]   There has never been an event which has been more public than the facts concerning the
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.480]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.880]   Paul very rightly, as an able advocate, he appeals to the king.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.800]   King Agrippa knew all about it.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.600]   King Agrippa was married to a Jewess, though he was an Idumean himself, and he was interested
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.480]   in the Jews' religion, and he knew all about these facts, and he can't deny them.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.160]   He knew they were true.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.760]   There were thousands of people who had seen Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.560]   They had witnessed his miracles.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.840]   They had seen him dying on the cross.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.760]   They were witnesses of the facts.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.960]   The thing wasn't done in a corner.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.400]   Even the Roman governor was a witness to the facts.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   They had taken him to Pilate.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   Pilate had spoken to him and had questioned him.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:11.120]   A report concerning him was even sent to the emperor in Rome, and there it is to be seen
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.840]   still in the records.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.960]   These things were not done in a corner.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:24.520]   These things belong to history, as definitely as the conquest of this country by Julius
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:33.280]   Caesar belongs to history, as surely as 1066 and William the Conqueror is history.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   So this is history.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:43.000]   Well attested, well authenticated, this thing was not done in a corner.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.800]   That's what Christianity says.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.120]   But then you notice it says another thing which is equally important, which I'll put
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.000]   like this.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:04.640]   All these facts which constitute the Christian message, all of them have been foretold.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.720]   These facts are nothing but the fulfillment of prophecy.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.600]   Listen to Paul saying that.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.840]   He says this is an extraordinary position.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:20.160]   He says that I have been persecuted like this by the Jews, but I've kept on.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.520]   Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue until this day, witnessing both the small
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   come, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:52.200]   the dead, and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.320]   And that was a very vital part of Paul's preaching.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.680]   That was a vital part of the preaching of every other single apostle.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.480]   This was their message in a sense.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.920]   Here they said are the facts about Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:13.640]   Can't you see, they said to the Jews who knew their Old Testaments, can't you see
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:19.480]   that all these things have been prophesied in the Old Testament, in your scriptures?
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:26.240]   Don't you remember reading in the 16th Psalm, they said, thou shalt not suffer thine holy
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.840]   one to see corruption?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.280]   Has that ever been fulfilled?
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.000]   They said no, it hasn't until now, but now it has.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.640]   So they took them through the prophecies which are to be found in the Psalms and in the prophets,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:49.440]   and indeed in the ceremonial and in the types that God gave to Moses on the mount to teach
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.600]   to the children of Israel.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.280]   Their resurrection is prophesied and predicted.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.720]   It runs right through the Old Testament.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:04.560]   The death of Christ, the Lamb, the Paschal Lamb, and then the resurrection, prophesied
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:15.720]   by Moses and the prophets, and now fulfilled and verified.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.820]   I am not mad, most noble Festus.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.600]   Is a man mad who states a number of facts?
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.380]   Is it madness just to teach history?
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:35.740]   Is it madness to show that this Jesus has enacted in his own life and death and resurrection
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.880]   the very things that were prophesied concerning the coming Messiah?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:46.560]   I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.460]   These things were not done in a corner.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.840]   He was a public person.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.160]   His life was public, his death was public.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.960]   The empty grave is public.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:06.480]   Very well, my friends, there is the first proposition.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   And I simply leave it by asking a question.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.040]   Have you considered those facts?
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.960]   Now the question is not whether Christianity is a good thing or not.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.360]   It's not the question what's the Christian attitude towards war or peace or industry,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.200]   or why doesn't the Christian church do something about putting an end to war, or what's it
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.680]   got to say about this or that.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.860]   That's not the question.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.480]   The first question is this.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:41.160]   Here are a series of events which have taken place in history.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   Have you looked at them?
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.920]   Have you considered them?
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.400]   The second thing is this.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:59.000]   Men and women are not Christian, not only because so many of them have ever failed to
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:11.360]   consider the facts, but secondly, because they fail to reason truly from the facts and
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:18.920]   to draw the right and the inevitable deductions from the facts.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:31.520]   I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.960]   What does soberness mean?
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.760]   Well, soberness means a sound mind.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   Soberness is not the opposite of being drunk.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.720]   Soberness is the opposite here of madness.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.800]   It's the opposite of being a raving lunatic.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:56.600]   It means a man with a balanced, controlled, sane, reasoning, logical mind who is capable
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.360]   of deductions.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.760]   And that is the reply which the apostle makes to Festus.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   "Festus is his most noble Festus."
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.280]   There has never been a time in my life when I have been less of a raving lunatic than
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   now.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.960]   It is now I am being reasonable.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.040]   It is now I am being sane.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.480]   There was a time, as I have just been telling you, when I went down from Jerusalem to Damascus
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.320]   breathing out threatenings and slaughter.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   I was mad then, but I am sane now.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:41.640]   Then I didn't reason, I was a creature of prejudice and of violence, but now I am sane,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:48.560]   I am sober, I am reasoning, I am calculating.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:34:00.160]   Let me put that then in this form, and I do it with the greatest possible respect.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:06.440]   To be a Christian is to have a sound mind.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.920]   Let me prove to you what I am saying.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:21.200]   Is there anything which is more foolish and more unreasonable than to ignore or to refuse
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.840]   to face facts?
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.920]   I could illustrate that to you endlessly.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:38.520]   I wonder whether it is not perhaps the major problem in this country at the moment that
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:45.080]   people simply are not prepared to face facts.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.280]   And they won't face facts because they don't want to.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.820]   We all want to have a good time.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.960]   We want to carry on with things as they are.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.720]   Facts, we don't want them.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.600]   They are unpleasant, so don't look at them.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.160]   But isn't that sheer lunacy?
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.040]   How many a man has gone to a drunkard's grave, I wonder, simply because he wouldn't listen
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   to facts?
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.720]   How many a business has gone wrong because a man simply would not face the facts?
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   His accountant may draw his attention to it.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.200]   Pessimism, he is not interested.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   Facts, he has got ideas.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.880]   What are facts to ideas?
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.920]   Brushes them aside.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.440]   How many a man has died and gone to an early grave because he wouldn't pay attention to
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.360]   facts?
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:51.960]   He paid no attention to that flush which he began to experience every evening, or to that
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:58.680]   loss of energy, or to that persistent cough that wouldn't go.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.040]   There were the facts, and people said, "Well, now, look here, go and see a doctor.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   Go and be examined."
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.120]   No, I shall be all right, says the man.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.280]   He will not face facts.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.640]   And eventually it's too late.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   Oh, I needn't keep you.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.920]   A man who doesn't face facts is a fool.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920]   That's lunacy.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.000]   That's madness.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.200]   But contrarywise to face facts is obviously the essence of sanity.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.240]   So Paul is justified in saying, "I am not mad, most noble Festus.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.000]   I have faced the facts.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.320]   Have you?"
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.280]   But wait a minute.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:47.560]   In the second place, I would suggest that it is always the essence of wisdom to pay
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:57.760]   unusual attention to vital, pivotal, and momentous facts.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.640]   There are facts and facts, of course.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.360]   All facts are not equal in importance and in value.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:11.120]   There are some things, some events, which are much more important to us than others.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.320]   But I'm simply arguing that it is a sign of a man of wisdom and of understanding that
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.360]   he pays great attention to the big thing.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   I mean, a man in business who spends his time over the pennies and the ha'penny's isn't
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.300]   showing that he's a great businessman.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.360]   He watches the big figures.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.960]   He's got somebody else to do that.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.480]   But he says, "I'll give my attention to the big things, the central things."
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   Quite right.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:42.840]   He doesn't waste his time with the mere details.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.000]   But a man who doesn't pay attention to great, pivotal, central, momentous facts is, again,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.640]   I say, nothing but a fool.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.680]   Very well, then.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.440]   This is the position as regards Christianity.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:08.960]   The facts recorded in this book are the greatest and the most momentous facts in all human
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.240]   history.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:17.160]   Now I'm speaking quietly, deliberately, advisedly.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:25.320]   I am asserting that the facts recorded here stand out in importance and in significance
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.200]   far away and above every other fact in history.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.800]   I know about the great turning points in history.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.400]   I don't want to detract from their value.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:45.760]   I've mentioned some of them already, 55 B.C., 1066, 1485.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.840]   Some of these great climactic turning points of history, tremendously important, and it
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:58.800]   is our business as citizens, intelligent citizens, to know our history and to know exactly these
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:09.560]   great events that have molded the whole future of the human race.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:18.440]   But I say, attach to them the maximum value to which they're entitled.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:25.400]   And not one of them, indeed I go so far as to say that all of them put together, dwindle
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:31.640]   into insignificance and nothing when you put them by the side of these facts.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   What are these facts?
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.600]   Well, they mean this, don't they?
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:44.800]   These are facts which assert that into this world of time and into the field of human
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:52.640]   history, the very Son of God himself has come.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.160]   Nothing less.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.600]   That is the whole basis of this message.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.800]   That is the result, the only deduction that can be drawn from these astounding events
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   to which I've been directing your attention.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:17.600]   Has anybody before ever been born of a virgin without a human father?
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.960]   Or since?
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.640]   Has anyone ever worked miracles as he did?
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.760]   Can you explain him in human terms?
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:38.320]   Has anyone risen from the dead as he did?
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.440]   And the answer is no.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   He stands alone, he stands apart.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.920]   There's only one explanation of him.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:56.440]   He is what he said he was, the eternal Son of God.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:04.400]   He is God the second person come down to earth, taking upon him a human nature.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.960]   And he lived and died and rose again.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   That is the statement.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:18.120]   Now I am just arguing, as Paul argued with Festus, that it is the essence of wisdom to
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.560]   face that fact.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:26.800]   I know all about your kings and princes and emperors, and all about your great battles
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.920]   of history, and the rising of a dynasty and the falling of a dynasty.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.000]   I agree it's all tremendously important.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.280]   But my dear friend, here is something I say, the powers over them all, that nearly two
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   thousand years ago, they entered into this world of time, God's own Son.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.760]   It is the essence of wisdom, I say, to pay unusual attention to this, and to say whatever
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.200]   else I'm interested in or I'm not interested in, I must come to terms with this tremendous
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.240]   fact and all that happened to it.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:14.520]   But that leads me to my next deduction, which I put in this form, that it is of the essence
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:24.560]   of wisdom to understand the meaning of these facts and to deduce from them their inevitable
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.320]   teaching.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.960]   And this is not difficult for us because our Lord himself expounded it.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.000]   You'll find it in the four Gospels, you'll find it especially in the teaching he gave
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.540]   his disciples after his resurrection from the dead.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.560]   He took them through the Old Testament scriptures and explained them.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.040]   He explained himself and why he'd come and what he'd come to do.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's all there for us.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.080]   Not only that, he explained it to this men's all of Tarsus and the road to Damascus.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.880]   He's just been telling Festus and King Agrippa how going down, breathing out, threatenings
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.960]   and slaughter.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:11.280]   Against this Jesus and his followers he suddenly saw that light and fell helpless to the ground.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:21.000]   And then the vice came and said, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.480]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.160]   And he in astonishment said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.880]   It was obvious that he was a Lord, he'd never seen a face like that before.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   This speaker was divine.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.280]   The brightness and the glory had actually blinded him.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.200]   And back came the last answer he ever expected to receive.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:54.160]   "I," said that amazing person with that beautiful, divine, glorious face, "I am Jesus whom thou
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.120]   persecutest."
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:05.960]   Then you remember how he went on to tell him that he'd appeared thus to him because he'd
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.440]   chosen him to be one of his preachers.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:15.800]   He said, "I'm sending you now to the Jews and to the Gentiles to open their eyes and
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:21.920]   to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan and to God that they might
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:31.680]   have an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in me."
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.400]   And ever since, says Paul, I've just been doing that with the power that he's given
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   me.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.320]   I have just gone round the world telling people these facts and drawing the deductions for
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   them and asking them to believe.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.040]   Well what are these deductions?
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.760]   What is this teaching that is based upon these facts?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.280]   Well let me just summarize it for you.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.800]   You notice he's already said that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.760]   should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles,
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.360]   the people being the Jews.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.360]   What is this light that Jesus Christ has come to give?
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.320]   This is the momentous deduction.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.080]   Why did the Son of God ever leave the courts of heaven and come on earth and be born as
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.600]   a babe and live and die and rise again?
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.640]   It's to give us light, my friends.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.720]   Light on what?
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.960]   Light on ourselves.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:44.280]   Light which shows us this, that we are all of us estranged from God, that we are all
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:52.320]   of us sinners, that we are all of us, as he puts it, in the power of Satan to turn them
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.880]   from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.440]   That's the light he's come to give.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.440]   He says so himself.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:11.840]   In other words, I can put it simply and briefly in this form.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:18.760]   What he has come to tell us and to teach us is that we are as we are because we don't
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.680]   know God and because we are not blessed of God.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.520]   It's because we sin against God.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.280]   That's why the world is as it is.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.800]   That's why the nations are all suspecting one another and are jealous and envious.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   That's why you have all the tensions.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.680]   That's why marriages break down.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.640]   That's why men fall into sin.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.760]   It's this evil thing that Satan has put into us.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.920]   He suggested it at the beginning and he's gone on suggesting it.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.080]   Christ opens our eyes to that.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.160]   Men and women are not aware of this.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.040]   That's why they reject all this, you see.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   They don't like it.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   They don't want to face it.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.440]   They want to carry on as they are.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.920]   But this is your trouble, says Christ.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.320]   That's why you are as you are.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.360]   You're a sinner and you're estranged from God.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:14.120]   But it's even more serious than that.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:24.640]   Because that is our condition, we are all of us under the wrath of God.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:32.480]   God being eternally holy hates sin and he can't pretend it isn't there.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.680]   The wrath of God is upon all sin.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:41.920]   I never tire of quoting this verse because the modern world seems to me to be such an
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.600]   absolute proof of its truth.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:52.160]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:57.800]   Which means this, that it doesn't matter what that wicked person does, it doesn't matter
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:06.320]   how clever he is, how able, how wealthy, how learned, he shall not enjoy peace.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.040]   And he doesn't.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:16.440]   And it's because he's under the wrath of God.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:29.040]   But of course the most serious thing of all is this, that man and the world thus in sin
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.480]   will have to face the judgment of God.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:41.080]   Jesus Christ has come to give us light on that.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   The selfsame apostle Paul in preaching in Athens said that the resurrection is God's
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:56.360]   public announcement and proclamation to the whole world that he is going to judge the
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:03.880]   world in righteousness by Jesus Christ.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   That's what these facts say.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.040]   Why did the Son of God leave heaven and come to earth?
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.120]   This is the only answer.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:18.880]   It is because, as he put it, he has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:25.680]   It's because man is helpless in sin and in the mess he's made of life, and he cannot
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.680]   deliver himself.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.920]   He's tried and he's failed.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.440]   Why has the Son of God come?
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:37.840]   Because all else had failed.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   But thank God he has come in order to save.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.360]   That is why he entered the Virgin's womb.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.160]   That is why he died upon the cross.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   That is why he rose again to deliver us from the wrath to come.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:09.600]   He came to bear our sins and their punishment, that God might reconcile us unto himself and
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.160]   forgive us.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:21.880]   And he has come to give us salvation, that they might have an inheritance among them
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:30.560]   that is sanctified by faith that is in me.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.800]   That's what he means by that.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:40.440]   He has come to deliver me from the fear of death and the fear of judgment.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:46.040]   He has come to deliver me from the power of Satan and the power of sin.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:51.760]   He has come to deliver me from misery and wretchedness and squalor and failure in every
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.720]   respect.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:04.960]   He has come to make me a child of God, to make it possible for God to shower his blessings
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   upon me.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.120]   That's what he's come for.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.120]   He says so.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.840]   He told Paul to go and preach that to the nations.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.880]   Tell them about the facts, he says, what you've seen and what you've been told, and draw the
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.080]   deductions.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.040]   And there are the deductions.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:40.120]   I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and of soberness.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:45.000]   I will put it like this to you.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   I am confronted by the fact that God's own Son came into this world and died on a cross
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.800]   and rose again.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:00.640]   And I ask, why?
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.800]   And the only answer I see is this.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.880]   He did it all because.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   It was the only way to save me from hell.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.040]   I've got to go on living even after I die.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.720]   Death is not the end.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.800]   There is a judgment, there is God, and there is eternity.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.880]   And you and I are going on to that.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.720]   That's what Christianity is about.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.240]   Am I a raving lunatic in this pulpit?
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.760]   Because I ask you to face things like that.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:46.440]   My friends, I've never been so sane.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:51.760]   I tell you that any man who doesn't start with the fact of his own certain death is
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.000]   a fool.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:02.400]   You've got to die, and you've got to face God.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.320]   And to face these facts is the essence of wisdom.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.600]   Very well, I say, face them.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:17.680]   Face your sin, face your failure, face the holiness of God and his righteousness.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.440]   Face the failure of the greatest saints.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.800]   Who are you to succeed?
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.760]   And then face him.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:37.640]   Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:44.680]   He rose from the grave, proclaiming thereby that he is the Son of God, and that he came
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:52.200]   into the world as it had been prophesied, to die for your sins, to rise again to justify
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:54:01.840]   you before God, to deliver you from the power of Satan, to turn you to God.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.000]   Have you faced these facts?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.240]   Have you faced this truth?
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.520]   Have you soberly drawn your deductions?
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.360]   If you haven't, you're a fool.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.920]   If you have, you're wise, and you can prove to me that you've done it.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:20.320]   This is the way, says Paul.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:30.240]   If you really believe these truths, these facts, and draw the deduction, without a second's
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.640]   delay, you will repent.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.920]   You will bring forth works, meat for repentance.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.040]   You will go to God and you'll say, "Oh God, I see it at last.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.720]   I've lived without realizing my position.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.160]   I didn't think of you.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.920]   I thought this life was all.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.760]   I said these are fairy tales.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.840]   I laughed at them.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.440]   I didn't believe the gospel.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.920]   I see it all now, and I want to be right with you.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.760]   I therefore confess and acknowledge my sin.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:05.680]   I see I've been a fool.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.800]   Is there still acceptance for me?
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   I have nothing to plead in mitigation.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.680]   I've ignored the facts.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:22.400]   I see them now, and I'm without defense."
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:31.600]   God will tell you, if you so go to him that he has so loved you, that he sent his only
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:37.520]   begotten Son into the world and even to the cross for you.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.320]   I care not if you've been living in the very jaws of hell.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.800]   I care not how black your soul is.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.600]   I care not how vile your character may have become.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.280]   Whatever you are, whoever you are, go to him in repentance.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:56:01.880]   Acknowledge your sinfulness, your vileness, your madness.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   And as that blessed Lord forgives Saul of Tarsus all his folly and his madness, he'll
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:17.440]   forgive you all, and he'll assure you that he died for you, that your sins are already
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.840]   forgiven, and he'll give you new life and make you a new man and give you new power
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.960]   and enable you to live with God for God.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:33.400]   And so when you die, you'll have nothing to fear because it'll mean going to be with
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:39.800]   Christ, which is far better.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.120]   This isn't madness.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.200]   This is truth.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.680]   This is history.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:56.480]   This is wisdom facing the facts and drawing the inevitable deduction.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.440]   Have you done it?
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.240]   Have you repented?
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.040]   Have you acknowledged and confessed your sin to God?
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:08.480]   Have you realized that your only hope is in Christ, the Son of God, who died for you and
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.160]   rose again?
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   If you haven't, I beseech you.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.600]   I don't know your name.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:22.600]   Let me call you Festus, most noble Festus.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:30.480]   Face it now, not madness, truth, soberness.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.960]   Amen.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:36.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
