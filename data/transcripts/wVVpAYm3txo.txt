[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.020]   Mike Kuiper, welcome back to the Bogo Heads on Investing podcast.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.780]   Tell us about your new book.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.020]   So the title is More Than Enough.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.620]   It's a discussion of the questions that arise when you realize you have more than you need.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.860]   So different financial planning topics that come up in that sort of scenario.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860]   Great book.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.740]   And like all your books, quick and easy read gets to the point, doesn't get super technical,
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.060]   but a very valuable resource for those looking to tackle the issue of what happens when they
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.020]   do have more than enough.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.540]   Let's jump to some questions we got from the Bogo Heads forums about your book.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.500]   Dr. Jim Dolley, aka The White Coat Investor, writes, "This book is all about the nuts and
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.860]   bolts and doesn't dive at all into the big questions that those of us beyond enough face.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.360]   What to do with the rest of our life?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   How do we work?
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.540]   How do we recreate?
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.740]   How do we find meaning and fulfillment?
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.500]   How do we choose how much to give to charity and heirs, now versus later, and the split
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.780]   between those beneficiaries and our own ridiculous spending?"
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.580]   The truth is that many of the practical issues he addresses very well in the book don't
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.160]   even matter at all, at much to anyone, at a certain level of wealth.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.080]   Everything Mike does is very deliberate.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.780]   Why did he decide not to include a section addressing these softer issues in the book?
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.380]   The short answer as far as why not to address questions like Jim raised, how to find meaning
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.340]   and fulfillment, is that those are questions that I'm not really qualified to answer.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.220]   Those are the fundamental questions of philosophy that humans have been wrestling with for literally
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.100]   thousands of years, and I just didn't really feel that Mike Piper can step into that discussion
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.260]   and add anything particularly new.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.440]   There's one thing that Jim said in his comment, and I'm actually going to quote it here.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.060]   He said that the book focuses on the nuts and bolts, which is true.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060]   It does.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.700]   And he said that the truth is that many of those practical issues that he addresses in
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.540]   the book don't even matter all that much anymore at a certain level of wealth.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.620]   And that is an assertion that I disagree with pretty strongly.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.540]   The reason for that, to kind of explain it, I often think of all of our money, every dollar
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.980]   we ever earn, ultimately going into one of five buckets.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.060]   I'm not talking here about bucket asset allocation strategies.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.280]   This isn't about asset allocation at all.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.380]   Bucket number one is every dollar you ever spend, defining that really broadly.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.500]   So it's discretionary spending, non-discretionary spending, taxes, and so on.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.700]   Bucket number two is any money that you ever give to another person.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.220]   So gifts to family members, other loved ones, et cetera.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.020]   Bucket number three is any money that you donate to charity.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.100]   And then any money that doesn't end up in buckets one, two, or three, so you didn't
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   spend it, you didn't give it away, you didn't donate it, ultimately is going to end up in
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.660]   buckets four or five.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.200]   Bucket four is money that you leave to another person as a bequest at your death.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.700]   Bucket five is money that you leave to charity as a bequest at your death.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.220]   In financial writing, and certainly on the Bogleheads forum, there's kind of an underlying
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.020]   assumption that we're dealing with bucket one, helping people make decisions that will
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.020]   allow them to satisfy their own spending.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.740]   And I think that's a useful assumption, a reasonable one, because most people struggle
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.740]   with that, right?
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.780]   You have to make a whole bunch of smart decisions in order to just have enough saved to retire,
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.400]   to satisfy your own spending.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.700]   And so we spend all this time.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.380]   Bucket number one is what we're looking at and thinking about.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.980]   I think it's easy to kind of accidentally make this leap to thinking that because bucket
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.780]   number one is what we're talking about most of the time, that that's the only one where
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.780]   the nuts and bolts decisions matter.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.180]   It's just not the case because making smarter nuts and bolts financial decisions allows
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.820]   there to be more money for buckets two, three, four, and five.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.820]   It's more money to go to your loved ones or causes that you care about.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.220]   As the amount of money grows, the idea that it becomes less impactful, that's not true.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.860]   The decisions you make become more impactful.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.980]   The difference is just that the impact isn't felt by you.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.500]   It's felt by somebody else.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   One more thing on this point, because I thought it was so interesting that Jim specifically
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.780]   is the person who asked this question, because if you've read his writing, you know that
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.780]   he does a lot of charitable giving, like you don't need to be telling him about charitable
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.780]   giving.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.680]   If somebody like him who is thinking so frequently about charitable giving can still make this
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.760]   mental leap to thinking that, oh, the nuts and bolts decisions are about us satisfying
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.200]   our own spending and making sure that that's satisfied, well, then any of us can make that
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   mistake.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.400]   And so I think it's important to remind ourselves regularly that these basic decisions, they're
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.120]   still important, even as the portfolio grows to exceed our own needs.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.680]   It's just that the people being impacted are other people rather than ourselves.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.320]   And for those folks who do want to spend more time thinking about the softer sides of financial
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   planning, they want to check out books by George Kinder.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   I will link to those in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.160]   Mike, this question comes from the username Unwitting Gulag from the Bull Guys Forums
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.040]   who writes, given that a steady and concerted campaign of saving and investing, it's still
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.240]   a good thing.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.840]   How do we avoid a perverse morphing of these thrifty habits into outright greed, recognizing
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.180]   our own greed?
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.960]   How do we manage it?
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.640]   So just like we were talking about a second ago, if you're somebody who is a natural accumulator,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.720]   saving and investing and saving and investing, and you are not personally inclined towards
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.040]   spending, well then, whether you plan on it or not, these dollars are ultimately going
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.680]   to somebody else.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.200]   Somebody might call that greedy because you're focusing on accumulating these dollars.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.520]   But again, they'll be somebody else's dollars at some point.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.120]   Although one point I make in the book, which I think is important, is that there is a big
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   difference between leaving money as a bequest and making gifts, and that earlier gifts can
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.200]   be much more impactful than a larger bequest later.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.960]   I mean, anybody who works in financial planning or even just anyone who's hung out on the
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.240]   Bogleheads Forum has seen this a million times, where you've got somebody who's in their late
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.160]   60s or sometimes even older, their parents died, they inherited a lump sum, and they
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.800]   don't know what to do with it because they were already financially independent.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.680]   It doesn't really do anything for them in any meaningful way.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.840]   Earlier gifts would have had a bigger effect.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.440]   And so that's a thing to be thinking about.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.720]   If you've got grandkids or people roughly college age, helping them pay off their student
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.060]   loans is a big thing.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.440]   It will put them in a much more secure financial position.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.220]   It will probably improve their mental health because debt is very stressful.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.880]   So smaller gifts at an earlier stage can be incredibly impactful.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.160]   Another point, the person was asking about how to get started giving, it sounded like,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.440]   was maybe a thought there.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.040]   I would say just start with a small amount.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.600]   If you're somebody who is inclined towards accumulating and kind of safe walling your
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.560]   assets, start with an amount that feels okay.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.640]   What I think most people find when they do that is that it feels good and it's not that
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   hard to give more later once you've gotten started.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.960]   With a lot of personal finance, a lot of spending, it's often kind of sold to us on this idea
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.160]   that it's a way to express ourselves, right?
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   Like you buy this particular car and it's a way to express who you are as opposed to
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.040]   that other car or these clothes or whatever.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.320]   And that can be true to an extent, but I think with charitable giving, that's the deepest
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   way to express who you are.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.280]   You're giving to this organization instead of that one.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.680]   And that's a really deep expression of your values and the things that are really important
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.680]   to you.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.160]   And I think that most people find once they kind of get started with that, it feels so
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.600]   good that it's not that hard to keep going.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.480]   Mike, that's really good advice.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   I really like that idea.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.980]   Start with an amount that feels okay because that annual amount that you can give to someone
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:09.920]   is rather high at $17,000 per person in 2023, and it's only going to go up from here with
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920]   inflation.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.160]   So that might feel like too much for some folks, and reasonably so.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.760]   So I really do like that idea.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.320]   Start with something small and see how it feels.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.680]   It's a great way to dip your toe into the water of gifting and giving.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.240]   And Mike, you didn't spend too much time, I felt like, in this last book more than enough
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.080]   touching on what you mentioned just now.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.000]   Hey, if you're going to inherit something from your parents, maybe you're already in
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.580]   your 60s, it doesn't make a big difference.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.060]   But in your last book, After the Death of Your Spouse, I feel like you did spend some
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.560]   more time talking about that.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.840]   And again, folks can check that episode out where we interview Mike on the subject in
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.920]   the Bogleheads live show, and I'll also link to that book in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.320]   Mike, for those folks who may be looking at inheriting any amount from their parents,
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.600]   but they've already reached that state of financial independence, tell us what their
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.160]   options would be for leaving that money to a younger generation.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.900]   Well, you can do this with anything, but retirement accounts is often where it comes up.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.460]   You can disclaim an inheritance.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:13.140]   So if you are the named beneficiary of something, you can basically say, "No, thank you," is
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.420]   what disclaiming means.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.980]   A key point there is that if you disclaim an inheritance, you don't get to pick who
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   it goes to next.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.880]   It goes to basically whoever's automatically next in line.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.980]   So if it's a IRA or 401(k) or something, then if you're the primary beneficiary, it'll go
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.540]   to whoever is the contingent beneficiary, the secondary beneficiary.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.500]   That can be useful in certain cases.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.060]   If it's, for instance, just a situation where you feel that somebody else should have inherited
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.060]   it, right?
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.300]   We're not talking about tax planning or anything like that, then that's an option, and then
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   it'll go to them.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.020]   But it can also be impactful from a tax planning point of view in some cases.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.380]   For instance, if the person who is the primary beneficiary has a much higher tax rate than
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.380]   the contingent beneficiary, then the primary beneficiary could disclaim it, it goes to
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.820]   the contingent beneficiary who might be, you know, the grandkids rather than the kids.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.120]   They might have a lower tax rate and they might be paying a lower tax rate on the distributions
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.380]   from the inherited IRA.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.540]   Marc Thiessen: Mike, this question is from a user named Maneuvens with a plus one from
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.540]   Harry Livermore, who writes, "If I have more than enough, should I stop 401(k) and Roth/IRA
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.180]   contributions?"
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.060]   And more generally, the plus one from Harry just asks generally about contributing to
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.660]   tax advantage accounts, regardless of it Roth or traditional treatment.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.980]   So if you've still got earned income and you can contribute to these accounts, almost for
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.860]   sure makes sense to continue contributing to Roth accounts, right?
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.000]   With Roth accounts, you basically, you just get tax-free growth, and there's not a lot
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.100]   of a downside.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.780]   The only potential downside is the 10% penalty if you have to take it out early.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.820]   But if we're talking about somebody who has more than enough assets, the likelihood that
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:55.380]   they need specifically these assets for spending prior to age 59 and a half is pretty limited.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.380]   Very small likelihood.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.360]   So Roth accounts, still definitely advantageous.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.620]   There still could be something to be said for tax-deferred accounts instead, because
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.060]   they also get to grow tax-free.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.220]   You earn the entire rate of return in a tax-deferred account, just like you do in a Roth account.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.060]   The downside is you just have to pay tax when you take something out.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.340]   So then we just get into the same questions we always talk about when we're talking about
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.380]   regular contributions to retirement accounts, is how does your tax rate right now compare
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.980]   to the tax rate that would likely be paid on these dollars later, whenever they come
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.100]   out of the account later?
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.820]   And if your tax rate right now is higher, then tax-deferred contributions likely make
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.820]   sense.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.800]   And if the projected tax rate later is higher, then Roth contributions make sense.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.700]   But in general, contributing to retirement accounts still absolutely makes sense for
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.740]   somebody in this more than enough set of circumstances.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.140]   I certainly agree.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.940]   I was working with someone on Tuesday, and they had access to a mega back-door Roth contribution
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.020]   feature in their Workplace Retirement Plan.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.500]   And for those who aren't tax planning and investing nerds, just know that means, hey,
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.340]   we can get a lot of money into that Workplace Retirement Plan.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:06.860]   Instead of that normal employee deferral of $22,500, we can get up to $66,000 into that
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.860]   thing.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.740]   Much of that being in Roth dollars that grow tax-free.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.020]   This gentleman was in the exact situation that we're talking about.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   He had more than enough.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.820]   He had a giant plain and vanilla taxable account.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.260]   So effectively, what we're doing by contributing to that workplace plan is we're just moving
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.100]   money from that plain and vanilla taxable account into that Roth account.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.540]   So if the question is, hey, do I want growth that's going to be taxable every year, or
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.100]   do I want tax-free growth, that's going to be a relatively easy decision to answer.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.100]   Exactly.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.940]   Mike, this question is from username WatchNerd from the Bullheads Forums, who writes, "If
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.900]   I have more than enough, how much of my liquid net worth should I have in TIPS, which is
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.180]   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities?"
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.020]   That's an interesting question because there isn't one right answer.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.420]   People who have spent time on vocal heads are almost certainly familiar with Bill Bernstein
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.380]   saying that if you've won the game, stop playing.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.100]   And the idea there is that if you've reached the point, your financial assets could provide
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.980]   you with financial independence.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:08.500]   But if a bad investment return outcome could remove that financial independence, then you
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.300]   don't want to be taking risk, basically.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.980]   If you've won the game, but you would have the potential to lose the game if you then
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.060]   kept playing, you want to have a very safe portfolio, and TIPS and IBONs are probably
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.980]   the safest assets for that sort of plan.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:27.220]   However, for somebody who has reached the point where even a series of bad years in
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:33.060]   the stock market and the bond market wouldn't really derail their plans, then basically
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.940]   anywhere on the risk spectrum could potentially make sense.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.380]   They could say, "I don't need risk, so I'm going to have a very safe asset allocation."
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.420]   Again, TIPS and IBONs.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.420]   Or they could do the opposite.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.900]   They could say that, "I don't need risk, but my well-being is not at risk due to having
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.540]   a risky asset allocation.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.300]   So I'm going to invest very heavily in stocks and then enjoy the higher expected returns,"
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.020]   with the idea that it's going to be more money left that we're most likely to heirs charity
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.700]   or what have you.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.220]   For people in that set of circumstances, really anywhere on the asset allocation spectrum,
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.380]   either extreme or anywhere in between, can potentially make sense.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.700]   Mike, your answer reminds me of what is now one of my favorite investing quotes, and this
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.980]   was from your last book, After the Death of Your Spouse, where you write, "There's no
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.460]   perfect portfolio.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.420]   There's plenty of perfectly fine portfolios."
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.180]   Let's jump to some questions about some tools for retirement planning.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.580]   Certainly important to be familiar with these tools if you're going to be a do-it-yourself
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.580]   investor.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:39.140]   This question is from the user named Time Lord from the Bogladge Forums, who writes,
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:46.540]   "How much weight should I give to calculators like FireCalc in determining how much is enough?"
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.980]   So FireCalc, for anybody who hasn't used it, is based on historical returns.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.220]   It basically lets you plug in a retirement spending plan.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.420]   You could say, "I plan to spend this much per year and adjust it in this way, and these
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.420]   are my other sources of income, social security, et cetera, starting at such and such date."
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.700]   And then it basically says, "How would that plan have worked historically?"
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:11.860]   Personally, my preferred approach isn't the historical approach, although that's a philosophical
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.860]   thing.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   I'm not going to say that it's worse.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.540]   My point of view is that if you're considering retiring right now, for instance, we have
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:24.260]   information right now about tips yields and about stock market valuation levels, which
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.900]   can provide us some guidance as far as what to expect.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.740]   It's not as if you can predict exactly what you're going to get, because no, of course
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.740]   you can't.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.340]   But if tips yields are pushing 2%, that's very different in terms of what you can expect
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.260]   from your portfolio than if tips yields are negative 0.5%.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.500]   Those are meaningfully different situations in terms of what you can likely spend from
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.820]   the portfolio.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:52.420]   And a historical approach is basically ignoring that information we have about what's applicable.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.980]   That said, FireCalc, I still think it's useful.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:01.700]   In general, I think tools like this are useful relative to the rules of thumb, the 4% rule,
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.700]   for instance.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.060]   Because when we bring up the 4% rule, somebody's always going to say, "Oh, it should be 3%,"
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.920]   and somebody's going to say, "It should be 4.5%."
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.940]   So there's that question about it.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.460]   And then there's the other question about the 4% rule concept as a spending strategy,
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.040]   where you just spend the same inflation-adjusted dollar amount, and you don't adjust based
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.700]   on portfolio performance.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.660]   And maybe you should be adjusting based on portfolio performance.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.980]   And that's another good question, too.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.220]   But they have another limitation, these rules of thumb, in that they just can't account
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.660]   for the fact that your life outside of your portfolio changes from one year to the next.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:41.420]   For a married couple, for instance, there's usually four big changes in their non-portfolio
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   income.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.900]   There's the day that spouse A retires, the day that spouse B retires, the day that spouse
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.820]   A's social security starts, and the day that spouse B's social security starts.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:56.300]   And unless all four of those things happen on the same day, which I have never seen,
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.620]   then the spending rate from the portfolio is going to change dramatically from one year
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.620]   to the next.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.660]   And so you can have this case where somebody's spending 7.5% this year, which if all you
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.540]   know is the 4% rule, you're going to look at it and think, "Oh my gosh, that's crazy."
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.940]   But maybe both people's social security kick in one, two, three years from now, and at
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.420]   that point it's going to fall to 1% or 2%.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.420]   Well then that 7.5% spending rate's totally fine.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.900]   That's just something that software can account for very easily, but 4% rule type rule of
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.940]   thumb just doesn't have any way to account for that very well.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.540]   There was a couple I worked with recently, because of their modest spending, their social
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.460]   security income, and their pension income, they were going to be saving money once social
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.940]   security kicked on.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:43.500]   So for them, that distribution rate beforehand didn't really have too much bearing on the
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.900]   success of their particular retirement plan.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.980]   There's another person who is a longtime reader of my blog who has talked about how she has
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.780]   a pension and social security, and they satisfy her basic needs.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.220]   And so right when she retired, she intentionally planned on a spending rate in excess of 10%
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.220]   and used that.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.740]   Because the goal was to not completely deplete it, still leave a bit of an emergency fund,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.060]   but mostly deplete the savings during the first several years of retirement.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.060]   That's what she wanted to do.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.060]   That was the whole idea.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.620]   So it made perfect sense, given the high level of very safe income that she would still have
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.620]   afterwards.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.660]   Firecalc is one of many do-it-yourself retirement planning tools available.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.660]   Rob Berger actually put out a nice blog post that talked about a lot of the different do-it-yourself
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.740]   retirement planning tools that are available.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.900]   In his opinion, Empower and New Retirement were some of the best options out there.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.180]   I'll link to that post in the show notes for our listeners that can check that out.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.580]   And if you want to keep nerding out on do-it-yourself retirement planning, I'll also link to a few
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.100]   episodes of the Bogleheads live show where we tackled that topic.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.180]   Most recently, in episode 41, we had Derek Tharp, who looked at a similar question, "What
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.260]   should I be considering in doing retirement planning myself?
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.300]   Should I be looking at something like the 4% rule, or should I be looking at Monte Carlo
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.980]   simulations?"
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.420]   We also interviewed Bill Behnken recently, creator of the 4% rule.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.020]   I'll link to that episode.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.820]   And then we also had Christine Benzon recently, and her study used Monte Carlo simulations
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.420]   to answer the question, "How much can I spend in retirement?"
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.580]   Again, I'll link to those in the show notes for folks who want to check those out.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.980]   Let's talk some more about do-it-yourself retirement planning.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.860]   This question is from a user named Travel for Fun from the Bogleheads forums, who writes,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:38.820]   "Is 33 times enough to pull the trigger, regardless of one's age?"
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.060]   If their portfolio is 33 times their annual spending, is that enough to retire?
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.940]   Again, we're left with looking at these rules of thumb here, so limited usefulness, but
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:53.580]   I would say generally, yes, because we're talking about a 3% spending rate, which is
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.300]   pretty darn safe, especially because, just like we discussed a minute ago, at some point,
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.940]   there's probably going to be some other income kicking in, because if they're asking regardless
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.100]   of age, they're probably young, so they're probably before Social Security age.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.580]   We're looking at a 3% spending rate, and then at some point, Social Security kicks in, and
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.460]   the spending rate might be even lower.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.200]   I would say yes, probably.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.500]   I'm always reluctant to make rules of thumb-based assertions, but I think it's probably a yes.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.620]   Yeah, I'd certainly say it's quite reasonable, if you're going to ask me, "Hey, is that a
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.820]   good way to look at it?"
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.820]   It's reasonable.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.260]   Now, nothing is guaranteed.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.340]   That's why I always tell folks, especially those who are doing their own retirement planning,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.460]   regardless of what metric or process or tool you use, you just want to look at it regularly.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.220]   That's going to help give you the best odds of success.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.700]   What you certainly don't want to do is look at it once, think you're okay, and never look
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.700]   at it again.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.240]   Success comes from constantly reviewing and possibly updating your plan.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.500]   Maybe that means spending a little bit less, if that's what it takes to keep you on track
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.100]   for a successful retirement.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.340]   Updating is critical.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.500]   The other thing I would add, the thing that would give me pause about that is just I would
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.240]   want to make really sure that that person is fully thinking about all of their expenses,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.380]   because if there's a situation where they don't have all of the proper types of insurance
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.460]   coverage or something like that, it's a 3% spending rate, but you're still exposed to
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.020]   some other major risk, well, then it's maybe not as safe.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.180]   As far as that spending rate, yes, 3% spending rate's pretty darn conservative, pretty darn
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.540]   safe, but you just still have to look at all of the other points of the financial picture
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.020]   and make sure that all of the other boxes are checked and so on.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.700]   Some of those surprise expenses that I'm sure you're thinking of, Mike, is going to be long-term
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:37.220]   care, and depending upon how much 33X is relative to your spending and how much you have saved,
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.020]   that can make an argument for, "Hey, maybe you've got enough to self-fund for long-term
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.380]   care, or maybe you don't."
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:48.500]   That's to say, "Hey, if I've got a pension and Social Security, all else being equal,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.380]   having that pension, that makes a little bit more of an argument for self-funding for long-term
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.980]   care compared to someone who doesn't."
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.780]   These rules of thumb, they're a great starting point, but then you want to look at your personal
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.060]   details to dig a little bit deeper, figure out what is the best answer for you beyond
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.100]   just that rule of thumb.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.100]   Absolutely.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:10.020]   This next question comes from username ThankYouJack from the Bogledge Forums, who writes, "For
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.740]   those with more than enough, how do you recommend overcoming the fear of running out of money?"
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:23.300]   I talk about this in the book, and to some extent, some level of fear and nervousness
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.420]   is just the reality, right?
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.120]   There's a lot that's outside of our control.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.560]   We don't control what tax legislation gets passed.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.820]   We don't control investment returns.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.100]   We don't control how long we live.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.180]   We don't control what our medical costs will be.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:41.220]   There's a lot that we can't control, and so some level of nervousness or anxiety makes
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.300]   sense, especially if you're just a person who is prone to nervousness and anxiety.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:53.780]   However, I do think that there are some circumstances, and if people can identify this for themselves,
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.640]   they can see that they are completely set financially.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.240]   They have functionally no meaningful level of risk to their well-being from their financial
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.620]   side of their life.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.960]   If they can see that and they understand that from a left-brain point of view, but they
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:16.560]   still are also regularly experiencing fear and anxiety, I think mental health care is
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.260]   a useful thing because mental health care, anxiety, and depression are basically the
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.480]   tax planning and asset allocation to a financial planner.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.400]   It's the things that they deal with all the time, a mental health care professional.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   The idea that financial anxiety is just another form of anxiety, this is something that somebody
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.720]   can help you with, and a lot of people think that's crazy to be talking about that because
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.260]   I talk about this in the book, at least briefly I mention it.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.200]   People are surprised to hear mental health care come up in a financial planning context,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.520]   but if you really do recognize that that's the situation you're in, you don't really
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.800]   have a financial risk but you're still feeling severe anxiety about it on a regular basis,
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   meeting with a mental health care professional is a great idea.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.720]   It's a very low risk proposition.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.280]   For some reason, people think it's a big scary thing, but you're just going to sit down and
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.240]   talk to a person for an hour.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.960]   Worst case scenario is you wasted an hour and whatever the payment for one session was,
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.640]   which is probably not a huge amount, and this person's being paid to care for you and treat
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   you respectfully.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.080]   So it's not like it's going to be the worst hour of your life.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   It's going to be fine.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   That's the reality.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.840]   Can't say for sure that it's going to necessarily help you, but it's likely to.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.800]   And it's a very low risk thing to try.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.040]   I went to mental health care immediately because that's what a lot of people wanted to talk
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.520]   about because that's the thing in the book.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.120]   But a financial professional could be a great idea.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.680]   The thing that people often ask me as a CPA is, do I have enough money to retire?
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.480]   And sometimes it's a close call and there's a lot of discussion and some difficult decisions
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   to be made.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.120]   But there's lots of times where the answer is they clearly could have retired several
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.320]   years ago and they just mentally and emotionally weren't comfortable with it yet.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.680]   Even though based purely on the numbers, there's no doubt about it.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.440]   And having an outside party just say, yes, you're fine, you're going to be fine, was
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   really what they wanted.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   That's all they needed.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.000]   And hearing that made a big difference for them.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.080]   For those folks who don't have more income than they're spending, I'm going to say something
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.600]   really boring, and that is tracking your spending.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.040]   That can help you with that retirement plan exercise.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.480]   If you're concerned about running out of money, then take a look at where your money is going,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.000]   figure out what part is discretionary versus not.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.880]   If you do that exercise and you find that you have a big chunk of discretionary spending,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.720]   that should let you know that you've got a lot of flexibility, you've got a lot of breathing
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.520]   room if things don't work out according to plan.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.200]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   Absolutely.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   Discretionary versus non-discretionary.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.480]   Splitting that up will let you know.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.580]   Yeah, tracking your spending can be pretty boring, but it can be a pretty important part
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.320]   of the financial planning process.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   Absolutely.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.920]   In our own household, we've never budgeted ever, but we've always tracked our spending.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.340]   That's all we've needed to do, is track the spending, make sure that it's in line with
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.760]   our priorities, make sure that it's in line relative to our income and other resources
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   and so on.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   And that works.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.080]   Tracking spending is critical.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.680]   Mike, this question comes from a user named JockDoc from the Bull Guys forums, who writes,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.440]   if I name a charity as a beneficiary of an IRA, does the brokerage notify the charity
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.880]   after I pass, or is this something that the executor would have to do?
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.920]   How does Mr. Piper recommend that we proceed given our goals?
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:27.240]   The brokerage will notify the charity once the brokerage knows about the death.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.520]   So it's going to be the personal representative of the estate, so the executor or the administrator,
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.680]   depending on context.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.600]   It's going to be that person's job to notify the brokerage firm to let them know that the
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.780]   original owner of the account has died.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.660]   But then from that point, the brokerage firm will take over having the assets transferred
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.300]   to the appropriate beneficiary or beneficiaries.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.940]   And Mike, for those folks who aren't estate planning nerds, tell us what a executor or
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.620]   administrator is.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.260]   So an executor is the person you name in your will to administer the estate.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:03.300]   So they're going to have the job of basically collecting all of the deceased person's assets,
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.020]   satisfying any outstanding debt, and then distributing the assets appropriately to the
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.500]   appropriate beneficiaries.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.620]   That's largely this person's job.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.580]   And executor is when you name that person in the will, and then they agree to take on
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.100]   that job because they don't have to, it's optional.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.340]   If a person is not named in the will, because usually that would be the case that a person
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.580]   dies without having a will, then the court will appoint somebody, and that person can
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:30.620]   be known as an administrator, and they have the exact same responsibilities, basically.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.900]   Collectively, those two terms, executor or administrator, are often known as the personal
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.900]   representative.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.660]   So the personal representative of the estate is the person winding up the estate, basically
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.660]   managing the estate.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.740]   Marc Thiessen >> And as mentioned, Mike does a great job on talking about estate planning
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.100]   in his previous book, After the Death of Your Spouse.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.780]   Again, that'll be in the show notes for folks who want to check that out.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.420]   This question comes from username JBTX from the Boglads Forums, who writes, "How do you
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.900]   determine with some degree of confidence, if you have enough, how much you may need
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.500]   to have enough when you have special needs or disabled kids or children who may need
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.140]   additional help throughout their lives, or perhaps parents that could need financial
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.140]   help as well?"
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.740]   Mike Mead >> Again, this is one of those cases where the rules of thumb, four percent or
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.700]   three and a half or whatever we decide is, you know, the quote, right number, is of limited
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:22.020]   usefulness, because those rules of thumb typically assume we're talking about 30 years of spending,
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.900]   for instance, and a flat amount of spending, whereas here we're talking about a very extended
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.180]   term as well as a changing amount of spending, right?
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.940]   Because we're talking about the person's own retirement spending, as well as the needs
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.220]   of their child or their parents.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.260]   And then, you know, at some point, if it's the parents, then that spending won't be relevant,
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.420]   or the person's own retirement spending won't be relevant at some point, and it'll just
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.420]   be the kid's spending.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.420]   So those rules of thumb have limited usefulness here.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.820]   So again, software is a great way to do it.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.540]   If you want a kind of quick and dirty DIY approach in a spreadsheet, what you can do
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.220]   is calculate what's called your funded ratio.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.820]   Basically what you would do is column A of the spreadsheet is all the years going forward
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.380]   2023, 2024, et cetera.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.860]   Column B would be all of your projected expenses that you want to make sure to cover, and column
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.500]   C is all of your expected income, excluding income from the portfolio.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.900]   So we're just talking social security, pension if applicable, or any further work income
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.140]   that you expect to have, and we're excluding interest and dividends.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:28.060]   And then you have Excel calculate the present value of column B, present value of all of
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.020]   the expenses, and then you have it calculate the present value of column C, so that's the
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.820]   present value of all of your projected income.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:40.260]   And then you add your current portfolio value to the present value of your income, and then
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.300]   you divide that sum by the present value of your expenses.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.340]   And the idea here is all we're calculating is we're seeing, do all of my resources, portfolio
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:54.500]   plus projected future income, how does that compare to all of my future expenses?
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.060]   After accounting for the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.420]   If that funded ratio, that quotient that we just calculated, is one or more, the idea
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.700]   is that you're good to go.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.540]   If it's less than one, the idea is that you need to make some changes.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.840]   The way that you can simply adjust for different retirement assumptions is just by plugging
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.020]   in different amounts in that future income as far as what year you expect your work income
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   to stop.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.580]   And that's a quick and dirty sort of analysis that you can do in a spreadsheet on your own.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.300]   It's of course based on various assumptions and so on, but it does account for the fact
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   you can make it look as far into the future as you want and you can account for all the
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.860]   different changing levels of income and expenses over time.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.920]   One person I work with recently asked how much they should set aside for long term care
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   for their parents.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.720]   That is a very difficult question to answer because depending upon life expectancy, that
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.020]   could be over a million dollars.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:55.100]   Another person I worked with recently, their parent needed memory care, and that was $12,000
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.540]   a month.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.780]   How long could that person who needed memory care, a person with dementia, cognitive impairment,
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.780]   live for?
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:06.700]   Well, recently I had on Cameron Huddleston, who wrote the book, How to Talk to Your Parents
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:14.300]   About Their Finances, her mom, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's relatively earlier, mid-60s,
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.700]   she lived for more than a dozen years.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:23.420]   So that would be a dozen years paying $12,000 a month for memory care.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   That could be huge.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.100]   Now, that's a little bit of an outlier case.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.780]   Most folks with dementia don't normally live that long, but they could.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.380]   So answering that question can be quite difficult.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:38.100]   Mike, I'm curious, what's your approach when answering this long-term care insurance question,
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.700]   whether folks should buy it for themselves or not?
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.140]   What considerations should they be making in the decision to make that purchase?
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.860]   I'm looking at generally the same things that most people are looking at.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.940]   What is the typical cost where this person lives?
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.920]   We want to try to get a ballpark of that.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.600]   So that's cost per year.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.180]   Then we can make some assumptions about how long might it last, the need for care, although
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.820]   just like you said, there are outlier cases for sure.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:09.340]   And then we want to be trying to figure out how easily could they just swallow that cost,
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.340]   basically.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.920]   If they could do that, then there's not such a need for insurance.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.580]   If they absolutely cannot do that, then insurance is likely to come into play.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.920]   And then there's also a different level of assets where instead of buying insurance because
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.100]   they probably can't even afford the insurance very well, then that's when you're relying
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.100]   on Medicaid.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.440]   Even if that's not the outcome that you want, sometimes that's still the best bet to make
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.780]   if buying the long-term care insurance is going to make it so that the other goals basically
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.100]   just won't be met.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.440]   Well, then that's the reality we're going to be relying on Medicaid.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.340]   One thing that can be useful to make sure to incorporate in that analysis is if you're
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.780]   looking at long-term care, in many cases, it's not this care cost on top of all of your
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.780]   normal expenses.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:55.740]   All right, if you're looking at your early retirement expenses, for instance, they probably
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.340]   include some travel and so on.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.520]   And if you're in an assisted living facility or some other sort of care facility, you're
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.460]   not going to be spending money on travel.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.460]   Also, facilities like that are going to be covering your food costs and so on.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.860]   You don't just want to be thinking, "Oh, it's this cost plus all of my normal spend."
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.780]   You want to be also putting some critical thought into, "How are my other expenses
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.800]   going to change as well in that sort of a situation?"
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.980]   And that wraps up our interview with Mike Piper.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.280]   Don't forget, you've got until the end of the month to take advantage of that early
