[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.320]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.600]   For this episode, I wanted to talk about the concepts of faith and reason coupled with
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.800]   grace and logic.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.340]   Faith and reason coupled with grace and logic.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.740]   It could be said that arguably prior to the Enlightenment period, faith and reason were
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.720]   not viewed as antagonistic elements in conflict with each other as it is assumed today.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.780]   However, this type of thinking has left an indelible mark through the centuries and has
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.440]   pierced its way through society and even the church.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.220]   It is for that reason much of our society and culture believes faith and reason to be
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.020]   opposing foes with reason of course being the superior boxer.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.620]   Faith is confined to subjectivity, privacy, weakness, and impotence.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.140]   Many Christians also seem to misunderstand the compatibility of faith and reason.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.060]   Not only do they misunderstand the compatibility of faith and reason, but they seem to believe
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.720]   just like the rest of society that they are indeed somehow antagonistic to each other.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.460]   As if Christianity requires you to leave your mind at the door.
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.180]   As if Christianity requires you to not ask any questions.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.140]   As if Christianity would not withstand the test of scrutiny.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.100]   This seemingly unspoken understanding leads to a chilling effect on asking questions that
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.260]   may make you seem less pious.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.260]   And so because one doesn't want to be perceived as less pious, genuine questions that could
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.780]   easily be answered go unasked.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.180]   Some of these questions may include the following.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.380]   Is there any evidence outside the New Testament for the claims made by the New Testament?
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.220]   Was Jesus a historical figure?
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.020]   Why are there so many religions in the world if there is only one way to God as Christianity
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.460]   claims?
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.820]   Isn't the nature of faith blind?
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.500]   Doesn't having faith require that I put my trust in something without regard to what
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.940]   it is?
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.740]   All these questions I just posed can be dealt with very easily, yet instead of seeing the
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:03.460]   claims of Christ and the implications of what God has said as the crown jewel of all thought
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:15.620]   and life, Christians may see God's word as antiquated, archaic, or maybe even irrelevant.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:24.460]   How starkly different is that tone compared to what is told of us in 1 Corinthians 1.20?
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.620]   1 Corinthians 1.20 states, "Where is the wise person?
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.380]   Where is the scribe?
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.940]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260]   Has God not made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.660]   Where is the wise person?
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.300]   Where is the scribe?
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.380]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.980]   Has God not made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.540]   When we read that passage, do we see how God has made the world's wisdom foolish or deep
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.540]   inside?
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.820]   Do we read this passage and think to ourselves that He hasn't?
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.900]   Of course, this isn't true for everybody, however, it may be markedly true depending
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.660]   on a particular area you happen to be situated in and whether or not it's a mix of how you
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.900]   were raised, the larger cultural subcontext that you're in, and even ignorance of what
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.980]   the scriptures themselves proclaim on this issue.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.940]   The scriptures themselves never state faith to be antagonistic to reason.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.400]   In fact, you see God employ reason many times in the Old Testament and you see Christ Himself
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.300]   employ reason many times in the New Testament.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.700]   It is for these reasons and that for the purposes of this conversation I would define faith
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.940]   very simply in the following way.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.580]   On the basis of what I do know about God, I will trust God with the things I don't
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.540]   know.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.220]   On the basis of what I do know about God, I will trust God with the things I don't
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.220]   know.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.380]   I know God to be good, to be sovereign, to be in full control, to be kind, and to be
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.060]   just.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.500]   I don't know why this evil thing happened.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.300]   I don't know why I'm going through the difficult circumstances I'm going through.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.300]   I don't know why my family is built in such a way when this other person's family is not
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.340]   built in the same way my family is.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.060]   But I will trust Him.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.420]   I will trust Him because I know He is good.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.000]   I know He is kind.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.140]   And even when I do not know the exact reason I am undergoing a difficult circumstance,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.940]   I know that I am in good hands.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.960]   Hebrews 11:1 states it like this, "Now faith is a certainty of things hoped for, a proof
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.820]   of things not seen, for by it the people of old gained approval."
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:15.940]   I want to go over some passages with you that reinforce this idea, both from the New Testament
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.700]   and the Old Testament.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.460]   The first passage I want to start with is in John 10 verses 22 to 39.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.020]   John 10 verses 22 to 39 says this.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.700]   "At that time the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.540]   It was winter, and Jesus was walking the temple area in the portico of Solomon.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.280]   The Jews then surrounded Him and began saying to Him, 'How long will You keep us in suspense?
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.900]   If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.'
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.500]   Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and you do not believe.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.980]   The works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.500]   But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.860]   My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me, and I give them eternal
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.860]   life.
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.840]   And they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of My hand.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.660]   My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.260]   out of the Father's hand.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.680]   I and the Father are one.'
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.740]   The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.980]   Jesus replied to them, 'I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.460]   are you stoning Me?'
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.800]   The Jews answered Him, 'We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.500]   And because you, being a man, make yourself out to be God.'
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.840]   Jesus answered them, 'Has it not been written in your law, "I said, "You are gods""?
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.700]   If He called them gods to whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be nullified,
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.540]   are you saying of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, "You are blaspheming
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.260]   Me because I said, "I am the Son of God"?
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.140]   If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.500]   But if I do them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.180]   and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am the Father."
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.100]   Therefore they were seeking again to arrest Him, and He eluded their grasp."
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:09.860]   Here, as the greater than Solomon is walking in Solomon's portico, He is asked to make
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.860]   a frank admission.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.220]   Jesus responds by stating that what He has done has already answered their question.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.580]   The future Messiah, you see, would accomplish a certain set of very particular, extraordinary,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.860]   and supernatural set of works.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:33.260]   Isaiah 35, 4-6 and Isaiah 61, 1-3 were portions of the Old Testament that were understood
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.460]   to be the future works of the Messiah and the works that would validate who the Messiah
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.460]   would be.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.780]   Isaiah 35, 4-6 states, "Say to those with anxious heart, 'Take courage, fear not; behold,
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.660]   your God will come with vengeance; the retribution of God will come, but He will save you.'
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.580]   Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened, and the ears of those who are deaf
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.340]   will be unstopped.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.580]   Then those who limp will leap like deer, and the tongue of those who cannot speak will
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.100]   shout for joy.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.860]   For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert."
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.500]   Isaiah 61, 1-3 states, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord anointed
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.140]   me to bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.460]   proclaim release to the captives and freedom to the prisoners, to proclaim the favorable
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.620]   year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, to grant
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.260]   those who mourn in Zion, giving them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.140]   of mourning, the cloak of praise instead of a disheartened spirit.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:47.140]   So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified."
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.700]   Having accomplished this in their midst already, and having announced at the beginning of His
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:59.200]   ministry that Isaiah 61 had indeed been fulfilled, remember Luke 4, Jesus states plainly that
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.340]   He already told them, and that the reason they did not believe was because they were
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.680]   not of His sheep.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:15.460]   He goes on to unequivocally state that He is also God, "I and the Father are one."
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.660]   Jesus' statement about His own deity not being lost on them, they pick up stones to
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.940]   murder Him.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:27.400]   Jesus then asks them for which work was He being stoned for.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.340]   Now don't miss out on the reasoning here.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.700]   Jesus doesn't say, "Why are you stoning me for claiming to be God?"
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.980]   If He did, He would be ceding the very ground He is about to use.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.180]   Instead, Jesus asks for which work are they stoning Him for.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.660]   Their reply is that they were not stoning Him for a good work, but because He claimed
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.580]   to be God.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.300]   Jesus replies, "But wait a minute.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:01.560]   Is that an offense worth stoning for, outside of any other evidence?"
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:08.200]   Jesus then quotes Psalm 82.6, which reads, "I said, 'You are gods, and all of you
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.980]   are sons of the Most High.'"
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.960]   Jesus' argument is roughly the following.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:22.040]   If God Himself uses that term outside of referring to Himself, and the ones stoning Jesus need
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:28.180]   not be convinced of the authority of the Scripture otherwise, then how could that be an offense
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:35.360]   worthy of capital punishment outside of any other contextual evidence?
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.740]   How could the mere mention of referring to oneself as God be blasphemy in light of Psalm
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.740]   82.6?
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:50.740]   And indeed, had any other person said that outside of Christ, it would have been blasphemy,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:58.020]   but the reference alone is not blasphemy since that would necessarily entail that the Messiah
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.380]   wouldn't be given allowance to refer to Himself as God.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.740]   But the mere reference alone, according to the Old Testament, is not blasphemy, since
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:16.300]   there is one who could say that without it being blasphemy, and that person was standing
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.060]   right before them.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.400]   Jesus goes on to reason with them even further.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.220]   He states that if He is not doing the works of the Father, or in other words, if He is
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.660]   not fulfilling Isaiah 35 and Isaiah 61, then yes, do not believe Him.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:38.580]   But if He is indeed fulfilling Isaiah 35 and Isaiah 61, and He clearly was, even if they
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:45.340]   do not believe the substance of what He is saying, are they not compelled to question
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.300]   their own disbelief?
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:57.780]   This is only one example of the intersection of grace and logic.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:06.300]   Jesus does not have to plead with them or reason with them, yet He graciously does.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:13.220]   He does in hopes that the pleading and the reasoning will bring them to their senses.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:19.400]   Even if you do not like the substance, even if you were expecting something completely
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.540]   different when it came to the Messiah, doesn't the very fact that I am fulfilling Isaiah
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:31.460]   35 and Isaiah 61, which were both understood to be messianic passages, doesn't that compel
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:41.500]   you to perhaps maybe re-evaluate your perceptions about the Messiah, and therefore Christ Himself?
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.700]   To say the same thing yet another way, instead of starting with your own subjective presuppositions
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:52.180]   as morally true, start with what the Word of God says to be true, since you're already
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.860]   stating that is your starting point, and if that is your starting point, and Christ is
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.580]   fulfilling the substance of it, then doesn't it stand to reason that your preconceived
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:10.340]   notions about who the Messiah is and who I am is actually incorrect, instead of the other
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.300]   way around?
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:23.540]   If you at least believed what you were seeing with your own eyes, with your own two eyes,
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:31.060]   then you would see that God is right in front of you.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:36.620]   You would see that God is right in front of you.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.180]   What about the Old Testament?
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.380]   Does God employ reason in the Old Testament?
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:51.500]   Consider Isaiah 118, "Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.340]   Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.340]   Though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.660]   Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord."
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:10.180]   God is asking us to employ our faculty of reason, based on who He is, His power, His
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.660]   redemption, His goodness, and His willingness to clean those who come to Him.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.180]   Does He not also have the power to forgive?
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.860]   Does He not have the kindness to love?
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.980]   Consider also the story of Job.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.980]   You know his story, right?
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:36.060]   Job was the most faith-filled man that ever existed at one point on the earth, who also
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.700]   happened to be very wealthy.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:44.980]   This speaks to his character since it was Jesus Himself who stated that in Matthew 19:23,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.460]   the following, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.460]   heaven."
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:57.580]   Yet God, in Job 1A states, this is Job 1A, "The Lord said to Satan, 'Have you considered
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.860]   My servant Job, for there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.140]   fearing God and turning away from evil.'
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.180]   God Himself confirms that there is no one like Job in all the earth."
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:21.420]   Again, Job at the time in his life was considered the most blameless and upright man.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.140]   Satan then falsely states that Job was faithful to God because of his circumstances.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.980]   So God allows Satan to take away his wealth, his children, his health, and even any hint
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.220]   of love from Job's own wife.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.540]   To add insult to injury, Job's three friends come and heap accusation upon accusation on
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:46.820]   Job, exhorting him to fess up to the supposed secret sin that brought upon him all the calamities
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.820]   in his life.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.500]   Job rightfully cannot fess up to anything because, as we know behind the scenes, the
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.180]   impetus for Job's calamities were not brought upon Job because of something he did, rather
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:05.080]   it was the cosmic conversation that Satan was having with God unbeknownst to Job or
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.580]   anyone else on the earth.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.620]   After an epic drawn out back and forth that included Job not portraying God as he should
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.700]   of, God answers Job out of the storm.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:24.580]   Listen to what God says to Job in Job chapter 38, 1-11, "Then the Lord answered Job from
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:30.740]   the whirlwind and said, 'Who is this who darkens the divine plan by words without knowledge?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.780]   Now tighten the belt on your waist like a man, and I shall ask you, and you inform me.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.500]   Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.320]   Tell me if you have understanding.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.680]   Who set its measurements, since you know, or who stretched the measuring line over it?
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.160]   When what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.680]   When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.900]   Or who enclosed the sea with doors?
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.760]   When it went out from the womb, bursting forth?
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.020]   When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling bands?
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.140]   And I placed boundaries on it, and set a bolt and doors.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:10.100]   And I said, 'As far as this point you shall come, but no farther; and here your proud
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.380]   waves shall stop.'"
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:17.680]   Do you see what God is doing here?
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:25.500]   He's introducing to Job the teleological argument, or to say the same thing yet another way,
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.760]   the argument from design, the argument from design.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:38.720]   To explain it a little bit more crudely, God is saying, in essence, "Job, you seem pretty
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.880]   self-righteous in your understanding of who you are, and how the world works, and who
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   I am.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.500]   So much so, that it seems like that you have a knowledge beyond yourself that I'm sure
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.480]   you didn't have.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.120]   But since you're saying you have this knowledge that I was pretty sure you didn't have, let
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   me ask you, where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.520]   I could have sworn you weren't there, but since you're acting and talking as if you
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.440]   know the intricacies of the world and how it works, please tell me, since you have these
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:17.480]   lofty opinions of innocence, justice, and guilt, riddle me this.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.680]   Who set its measurements, since you know, or who stretched the measuring line over it?
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.080]   On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone?
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.680]   Oh wait, I'm sorry, you're saying you don't know.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.520]   So let me get this straight, Job.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:43.640]   You don't have this vast knowledge, yet you still believe I called all things into existence.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.400]   You don't know, nor do you understand all the complexities, all the elaborations of
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   how the universe came into existence, yet you do believe I brought the universe and
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:05.340]   all that it is into existence, that I brought the universe and all of existence to be.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:14.000]   So you do not believe that understanding everything about the universe exhaustively is a necessary
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.120]   prerequisite for belief that I, God, created it.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:30.520]   Job, if that is indeed the case, on the basis of what you do know, on the basis of what
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:38.680]   you do know, can you trust me with the things you don't know?
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.120]   You don't know how the universe came into being.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   You don't understand it.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:50.700]   You know I did it, and even though you don't understand it completely, you still believe
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.380]   that I created it.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:59.680]   So just like you believe that, and even though you don't understand exactly why you're going
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:08.200]   through the things that you are, can you trust me, and not indict me, can you trust me with
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.760]   the things that you don't know?
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.880]   Listen to how Job responds to God after God speaks to Job out of the whirlwind.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:26.640]   This is Job in Job 42, 1-6, Job 42, 1-6, he says this, "Then Job answered the Lord and
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:33.080]   said, 'I know that you can do all things, and that no plan is impossible for you.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.040]   Who is this who conceals advice without knowledge?
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.640]   Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.660]   which I did not know.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.200]   Please listen, and I will speak.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.920]   I will ask you, and you instruct me.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.680]   I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.280]   Therefore I retract, and I repent, sitting on dust and ashes.'"
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   For Job, at the end, it was the appearance of God, the relationship that he had with
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:11.200]   him, that finally put everything at ease, that put all the disjointed pieces of his
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:20.360]   life together, that brought together all the pieces of his life that had no meaning, that
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:31.240]   were fragmented, but then were infused by God with purpose, design, and meaning.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:37.600]   One angle amongst many angles, as it relates to our discussion, is very simply the following.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:47.040]   Based on what I do know about God, it is very easy to trust God with the things I don't,
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.640]   the intersection of faith and reason.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.880]   The intersection of faith and reason.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.440]   Based on what I do know about God, that He is good, that He is holy, that He is kind,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.040]   that He is loving, that He is intentional, that He is purposeful, that He holds all things
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:10.760]   within the palm of His hand, I will trust Him even when I can't see that design for
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.140]   myself.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.680]   Even when I can't see that design for myself.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:28.660]   I want to give you another example from Matthew, Matthew chapter 22, 23 to 33.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.560]   Matthew chapter 22, 23 to 33, it says this.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.960]   "On that day, some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.800]   Him, saying, 'Teacher,' Moses said, 'if a man dies having no children, his brother
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.260]   as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up children for his brother.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.520]   Now there were seven brothers among us, and the first married and died, and having no
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.080]   children, he left his wife to his brother.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   It was the same also with the second brother, and the third, and down to the seventh.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.200]   Last of all, the women died.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be?
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.560]   For they all had her in marriage.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.000]   But Jesus answered and said to them, 'You are mistaken, since you do not understand
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   the Scriptures nor the power of God.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.040]   in heaven.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.040]   But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040]   God?
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.240]   I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.600]   He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.'
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:40.320]   When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching."
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:49.240]   This is, again, an example of the compatibility of faith and reason.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.720]   The Sadducees, thinking they could entrap Jesus with their knowledge of Moses, came
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.640]   up to him and gave him a theological mind trap, or so they thought.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.320]   What's interesting is that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife because they only
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.480]   held to the books of Moses, aka the first five books of the Old Testament.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.600]   Yet since they only held to that, they considered themselves experts in the first five books
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.100]   of the Old Testament.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.720]   So Jesus' answer to the Sadducees is that they do not understand the Scriptures nor
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.360]   the power of God.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.160]   They do not understand the Scriptures nor the power of God.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.960]   God is indeed able to raise the dead, and there is indeed an afterlife, and we are not
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.360]   given in marriage like here on earth, but are more like the angels.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.840]   To prove to them that they do not understand the Scriptures nor the power of God, Jesus
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.600]   doesn't quote from outside the first five books.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   And he could have.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.920]   Remember, I just told you that the Sadducees only accepted the first five books of the
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   Old Testament as authoritative.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.960]   Anything quoted to them outside of the first five books, they would have unfairly just
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.120]   shunned away as not from God.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.660]   And although had Christ done that, he still would have been in the right, we again see
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:19.080]   the intersection of grace and logic, since he does not need to answer their question
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.660]   in this manner, yet he does.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:31.320]   Jesus states that God is, as it says in Exodus 3.6, which is within the first five books
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   of the Old Testament.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.480]   Remember, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.920]   Jesus states that God, as it is in Exodus 3.6, he also, he said also, "I am the God
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.360]   of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.080]   Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.720]   I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.160]   Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.440]   Jesus very purposefully and very intentionally used Exodus, since they understood it to be
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.560]   authoritative and employs reason, since God made that statement to Moses.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.000]   And by the time this statement's being made to Moses, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have long
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.900]   been in the ground.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:28.560]   If God is saying that to Moses, this is very explicitly stating that Abraham, Isaac, and
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   Jacob are still alive.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.200]   Their flesh might be in the ground, but make no mistake about it, they are still, in a
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.440]   very real sense, still alive.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.520]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:52.200]   God himself testifies in the first five books of the Old Testament that there is an afterlife,
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.980]   contrary to what the Sadducees believed God taught in the first five books.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:03.080]   But as Jesus stated, they did not understand the scriptures, and by extension of that,
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.920]   the power of God.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:14.680]   That is why, when the crowds heard this, they were astonished.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:24.960]   The true knowledge of God, cutting through the deep darkness that had tried so hard to
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:32.040]   conceal the truth of God's word.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:38.000]   Faith and reason, grace and logic.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.320]   Not only is reason compatible with faith, faith and reason are actually intertwined
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.080]   and work in conjunction with one another.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.200]   Let us not elevate reason to a God-like status, to the point of idolatry.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.600]   At the same time, let us understand reason for what it really is, a God-given gift that
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.440]   separates us from the beast.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:08.240]   Mark says us image bearers, and use this precious faculty to the potential that God has gifted
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.920]   to each one.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.160]   In the next episode, I'm going to address the reliability of the New Testament documents.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:23.840]   Let us reason together to see the empirical evidence that God has so graciously left for
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.520]   us.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:32.220]   Matthew 22, 34-37 states, "But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.780]   they gathered together.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.420]   And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him, 'Teacher, which is the greatest
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.280]   commandment in the law?'
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.960]   And he said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:30:04.200]   soul, and with all your mind.'"
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:25.640]   (Matthew 22)
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:35.080]   (End)
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.660]   (upbeat music)
