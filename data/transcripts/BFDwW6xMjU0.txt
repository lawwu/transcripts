[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John Podcast with longtime author and pastor John
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.920]   Piper.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.720]   First up this week, we have a question about the original sin that was committed by Adam
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.960]   and Eve, and it's an insightful follow-up question to something that you have said.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.240]   "Hello, Pastor John, and thanks for taking my question.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.820]   My name is Alex from Dallas.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.000]   According to your sermon at Passion 2017, you said the ultimate essence of evil in the
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.840]   Garden of Eden was not eating the fruit.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.940]   You said they lost their taste in God, so they sinned before taking a bite.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.320]   Can you explain this, please?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.720]   I thought there was a difference between temptation and giving in to sin."
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.760]   Let's clarify two things.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.520]   One, the difference between the essence of sin on the one hand and sinful actions of
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.120]   the body on the other hand, and two, let's clarify the difference between temptation
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   and sinning.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.320]   It seems like those are the two levels of Alex's question.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.560]   First, there's a difference between the essence of sin and the outward act of sinning.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.280]   The essence of sin is not what muscles do.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.600]   It's what the heart does, and by the heart, I mean the inner faculty of willing and desiring
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.740]   that give rise to actions.
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.800]   If some very strong person took hold of your arm against your will and by force caused
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   you to stab somebody while you resisted with all your might, you would plead that you did
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.760]   not commit wrong.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:57.200]   But if your heart moved your arm to stab somebody, you would have done wrong, and you know it.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.960]   So the essence of sin is not the movement of the physical members of your body, but
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.840]   the desires and purposes of the heart.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:18.360]   External, muscular movements are morally evil only insofar as they are expressions of an
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.040]   evil heart.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.600]   So when Adam and Eve used their biceps and triceps and hand muscles to reach for the
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.440]   forbidden fruit and then used their jaw muscles to bite it, those outward acts of the muscles
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   were evil precisely because they were expressions of a heart that had lost its taste for the
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.320]   superior satisfaction of God and had become dominated by desires for something more than
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   God.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.920]   And that sinful condition of the heart preceded the muscles and their movement and the biting.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.680]   That was the point that I was trying to make.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.560]   Now, the second clarification, Alex seems to think that that distinction that I just
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.680]   made somehow contradicts the distinction we usually make between temptation and sin.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.540]   So let me try to give a couple biblical glimpses of how to understand temptation and its relation
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.680]   to sinning.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:37.900]   First, we know from Luke 4, 2 and Matthew 4, 1 that Jesus was tempted in the wilderness
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.900]   by the devil.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.600]   It's said explicitly he was tempted.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.360]   And we know from Hebrews 4, 15 that though he was tempted, he did not sin.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.600]   Now my conclusion, therefore, just from those few facts, is that Satan's temptations are
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   very often external offers of pleasure, which if we embrace them would be sin.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.980]   But hearing and seeing the offer is not sin.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.320]   So in Adam and Eve's case, there were things about the tree, the fruit, that offered pleasure.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.440]   It was an objective offer and Satan was boosting it.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.120]   Perceiving that external objective offer is not sin.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.600]   Jesus saw it.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   He heard it.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.740]   Adam and Eve saw it.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.520]   They heard it.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.060]   Perceiving the offer of pleasure, which if we embraced it would be sin, is not sin.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.500]   But Jesus did not embrace it.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.420]   He thrusted away by the Word of God.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:58.440]   Adam and Eve tasted and embraced it, savored it, preferred it over God, and acted on it.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.760]   In savoring it, the offered pleasure became so compelling that the desire for it was greater
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.100]   than the desire for God.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.020]   At that point, the essence of sin had happened in their heart.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.700]   Then the muscles kicked in and made it visible.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.840]   Now I'd like to just stop right here because I think that's relatively simple, straightforward
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.520]   distinction between temptation and outward sinning.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   But as so often the case in Scripture, James won't let us stop here.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.540]   He makes things more complicated.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.340]   So we got to deal with James 1, verses 13 to 15, because James bores in.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.520]   Let me read what he says.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.600]   He defines temptation differently than what I have just said.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.000]   Here's what he says.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.720]   Let no one say when he is tempted, "I'm being tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.480]   with evil.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.000]   And he himself tempts no one.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.560]   But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.600]   Now there's a key difference from what I've said so far.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   He continues, "Then desire, when it has conceived," literally becoming pregnant, "then desire,"
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.560]   becoming pregnant, "gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   death."
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.960]   Wow, that's complicated.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.440]   So here's what James seems to be doing.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:59.320]   He's digging down into the heart to analyze what happens between the external offer of
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:07.160]   pleasure that I've called temptation, and the moment when our internal desire becomes
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.240]   pregnant with a preference for that pleasure.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.560]   I think James realizes that there are often good desires in the heart which do correspond
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.200]   to the desire being offered in temptation, which are not yet sinful.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.520]   For example, if somebody offered you $1,000 to lie to the police about something you had
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.840]   seen, and your wife and children were starving because you couldn't afford food, you would
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.640]   feel a desire for $1,000 that could buy food.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.720]   "Oh yes, I want $1,000 to buy food for my family."
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:57.280]   That desire that you feel in that moment need not be sinful, even though it corresponds
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.400]   to the evil pleasure being offered you, because you draw a line, you draw a line.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:10.880]   And when that desire starts to cross over to a preference for the bribe, more than trust
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.120]   in God and His way, you cut it off.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.560]   You cut it off with the Word of God.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.800]   You put it to death with the Word of God.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.360]   I think that's exactly what Jesus did.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.800]   The Bible says He was hungry.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.600]   He hadn't eaten for 40 days.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   Good grief.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.080]   He was hungry, and Satan offered Him bread.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.960]   No doubt Jesus felt a huge desire for bread.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.720]   In other words, His desire corresponded to the pleasure that was being offered in the
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.800]   temptation.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:55.640]   But Jesus never allowed the desire to become a preference for bread over the will of God.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:08.040]   Now, what James says is that each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.880]   own desire.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:20.360]   And I think he means that this alluring and enticing at some point crosses the line into
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.440]   sin.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.240]   And he describes it as becoming pregnant, pregnant with sin, because that's what you
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   give birth to.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.280]   You give birth to what you're pregnant with.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.880]   He gives birth to sin.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.760]   The reason I think this is because he says God cannot be tempted.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.560]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.120]   We know Jesus was tempted.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:51.760]   So James is defining temptation to include the point of allurement and enticement that
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.680]   crosses over into sin.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.880]   That's why God cannot be tempted in that sense.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.200]   Jesus couldn't be tempted in that sense.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.600]   So here's the upshot.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.200]   Sorry to make it so complicated, but that's just what we're stuck with as God is entrusting
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.520]   us some glorious things here in His Word.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:19.740]   "Ordinarily, we understand temptation to be the external offer of a pleasure, which
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.880]   if we embraced it would be sin."
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.360]   I guess the ordinary use of the meaning of temptation.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.520]   "We may experience desires that correspond to that pleasure, which are not yet sinful,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.080]   like Jesus' hunger in the wilderness.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:43.600]   But sometimes the New Testament understands temptation to include the crossing of the
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.240]   line between an innocent pleasure that we experience, that we have, that we desire,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.520]   and the preference of that pleasure over God and God's will, and therefore how vigilant
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.320]   we should be."
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.000]   Indeed, the utmost vigilance.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.760]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this deep exploration of the complex relationships between our affections
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.480]   and our temptations and our sins.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.900]   And that is a really great follow-up question, Alex.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.360]   Thank you for sending that in.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.320]   And thank you for listening and making this podcast a part of your day.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.800]   Three times a week we publish, and you can subscribe to our audio feeds to keep up with
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.420]   the new episodes, and you can search our past episodes in our archive and reach us by email
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.120]   with a follow-up question you may have about something you've heard Pastor John say or
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.400]   something he's written in the past.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:40.160]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.680]   And many of you are probably familiar with the Desiring God slogan, "God is most glorified
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.800]   in us when we are most satisfied in Him."
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.200]   You could hear all of the entailments of that in this episode today, but you may not be
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.600]   aware of the history of the slogan and how it came about.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.840]   And a listener has asked to hear the backstory, and John Piper will share it with us on Wednesday.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.040]   Where did the DG slogan come from and how did he write it?
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   That's Wednesday.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.560]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.160]   We'll see you then.
