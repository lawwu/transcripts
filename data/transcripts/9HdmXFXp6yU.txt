[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Zeus refused to allow us to have fire.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   And the fire, I think, means both literal fire,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   to allow us to become bronze-age man,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   to create weapons and to cook meat,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   but also the internal fire of self-consciousness and creativity,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   the divine fire.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And Zeus didn't want us to have it.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And Prometheus stole fire from heaven, gave it to man,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and Zeus was so angry that he punished Prometheus
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   by chaining him to a mountainside.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And the other punishment was that Zeus and the other gods created Pandora,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   the all-gifted, that is what Pandora, all-gifted,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   and sent her down as the first woman.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   She had everything.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   But he also gave her this jar.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   She was told she shouldn't look into the jar,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   but she had this curiosity and she opened the jar,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and I'm sure you all know the story,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   out flew hardship, lies, deceit, murder, pestilence,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   all the ills of the world, and the golden age was over.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   She slammed the lid back on, and one little fairy was left inside,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Elpis, hope.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Now, I'm going to put that to one side,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and I'm going to go back to 1989,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   when I became fascinated by this extraordinary new development
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   in which you could network computers to a network of networks,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   which was starting to be called the Internet.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I thought this is the biggest and most exciting bringing together
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   of human beings in the history of our planet.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It is the all-gifted.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It will give us freedom of access to knowledge.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   We will share things, art, politics.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Boundaries will be dissolved.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   When social media came, and the Arab Spring,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and I thought there would be no more tribalism,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   no more hatred, no more racism.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   This would be wonderful.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   But what happened?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   The lid opened, and out came trolls, out came abusers,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   out came racists and tribalists and insulters
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   and the worst kind of humanity.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It was an exact replay of Pandora's box,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and I thought that was so interesting that the Greeks had this understanding
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that when we have something that seems perfect,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   there is no possibility but that it also contains its opposite.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I guarantee you, whether you like to think it or not,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   that although we know through Darwin and science and genes
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   that we were not created by an intelligent designer,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   in 100 years' time, we can guarantee there will be sapient creatures,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   sapient beings on this earth that have been intelligently designed.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You can call them robots, you can call them compounds
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   of augmented biology and artificial intelligence,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   but they will exist.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   My question is this.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   When the Prometheus, who makes the first really impressive piece
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   of robotic AI, like Frankenstein, but like Prometheus,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   back in the Greek myth, they will have a question.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Do we give it fire?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Do we give these creatures self-knowledge, self-consciousness?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   An autonomy that is greater than any other machine has ever had
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and will be similar to ours?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   In other words, shall we be Zeus and deny them fire because we're afraid of them,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   because they will destroy us?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And the Greeks and the human beings did destroy the gods.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   They no longer needed them.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And it is very possible we will create a race of sapient beings
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   who will not need us.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   [ Silence ]
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   [ Silence ]
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
