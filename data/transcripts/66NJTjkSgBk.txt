[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   A few years ago, Pastor John was asked a question about reading the Quran and other such religious books.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   "If I want people in other religions to consider reading the Bible,
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000]   then should I be willing to return the favor and read their holy book?"
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500]   That's the essence of the question.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500]   And here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   I think it depends on how serious they are and serious you are and the kind of person you are.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:42.500]   Not everybody is gifted or called to be an analyzer of other people's religious literature,
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.500]   and it could be dangerous, I think, especially if they're just provoking you.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.500]   But if you've got a serious conversation with an intellectual person, say a professor of Islam,
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.500]   or just a thoughtful work colleague who takes their holy book very seriously,
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   and you want them to consider listening to the Bible or reading it,
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.500]   and they say, "Well, could you trade? You know, talk about mine one week and yours one week?"
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500]   I think that would be good.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.500]   If you're wired to be involved with that kind of person at that level, and they're wired that way, yes, yes.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   I just want to avoid saying, "In order to be a credible Christian, you've got to read the Quran,
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   or you've got to read the Hindu holy books, or you've got to read the Book of Mormon."
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   I don't think so, because most people, number one, don't have time,
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.500]   don't have the inclinations and the intellectual wherewithal to read all the things in the world.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   And if you said the only way to have a credible faith in Jesus is to have read all the options
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   and discovered all the reasons for why those options don't suffice,
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   you'd spend your whole life, or at least a big hunk of it, reading all this stuff.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   There has to be a way to read the Bible and see enough self-evidencing and validating truth there.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   Jesus shining forth from the Scriptures, winning our trust that we know this is true
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   and don't have to be threatened by other holy books, even though we haven't read them.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   It's like if you've tasted two things, and that's honey, and somebody says,
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   "But I've got another brown thing over here that's honey."
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   You say, "But this is honey. I can tell this is honey. I've tasted this."
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   You don't need to experiment with every brown, viscous thing that's brought to you
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   in order to be sure this is honey.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   That was Pastor John a few years ago, and recently he traveled to the Middle East,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   and when he returned, he had some fresh thoughts for us on Christianity and Islam
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   that he shared on this podcast. You may remember that in Back to Back episodes 233 and 234.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   Those episodes were titled "Lessons from the Middle East" and "Muslims vs. Christians on the Sovereignty of God."
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   You can find both of those episodes and over 300 others most easily in the Ask Pastor John apps
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   for the iPhone and the Android, both of which are free for you thanks to our faithful financial donors.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   We will return tomorrow with a question about entertainment.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   Specifically, how can I break my addiction to it?
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
