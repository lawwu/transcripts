[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.460]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960]   My guest today is Pavel Satsulin.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   Pavel Satsulin is considered one of the premier
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.040]   strength training and fitness coaches in the world.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.720]   He has pioneered the development of various programs
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.740]   to improve strength,
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.460]   which he calls the mother of all fitness.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.400]   Indeed, today you will learn about strength as a practice,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.480]   as a skill that can be applied to sports,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.560]   that can be applied to general fitness,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.880]   to getting leaner, to getting faster,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.500]   and to improving your endurance.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.280]   As Pavel Satsulin explains,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.620]   by building one's strength through body weight exercises,
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.000]   free weight exercises, and occasionally machines,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.580]   one can develop incredible levels of fitness at any age.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.960]   We discuss some of the spectacular examples
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760]   of people in their seventies and eighties
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.560]   performing strength feats like a hundred pull-ups per week.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.280]   And we emphasize that one does not have
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.720]   to be seeking hypertrophy.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.380]   One does not have to be seeking getting larger muscles
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.920]   in order to get exceptionally strong.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   I myself, these days, am focusing primarily
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.840]   on trying to get stronger and build endurance
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.780]   for sake of health and for general life reasons.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.800]   And because getting really strong
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.640]   turns out to be very beneficial in every aspect of life.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.660]   Today, you're going to learn how to get extremely strong.
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.960]   You can add muscle if you want in parallel with that,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020]   or as Pavel Satsulin explains,
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.800]   you can pursue strength and flexibility for their own sake.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.960]   And there's tremendous value for doing so.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.000]   So today's discussion pertains to women, to men,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.280]   and frankly, to people of all ages.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120]   I do think that pursuing strength as its own thing,
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.140]   independent of muscle growth, right?
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.880]   Which we hear so much about these days.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.400]   Everyone wants hypertrophy, grow muscle, this and that.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.120]   Pursuing strength as its own thing
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.520]   is a tremendously valuable endeavor.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.940]   Today, you're going to learn how
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.460]   from the world's premier expert in this topic.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.500]   You're in for a very special episode with Pavel Satsulin.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   He is truly in a class all his own
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.660]   when it comes to fitness and strength training.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.500]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.140]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.300]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.060]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.420]   to the general public.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.080]   this episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.220]   And now for my discussion with Pavel Satsulin.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.300]   Pavel Satsulin, welcome.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.420]   - Andrew, pleasure to be on your podcast.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.720]   Respect your work a lot.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.940]   - Thank you, likewise.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.780]   - Thank you.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.300]   - I will say that you and perhaps one other person
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.080]   have truly changed the way that I think about fitness,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.780]   the way that I train,
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.460]   and I'm super excited to talk to you today.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.220]   So I'm withholding excitement.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.980]   There are a bunch of different ways to think about
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.320]   this thing that we call fitness,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.700]   strength, endurance, hypertrophy,
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.000]   and there's so much information out there now.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720]   How do you conceptualize fitness?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.780]   Meaning, do you look at things through the lens of,
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.160]   are we focused on nervous system,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.420]   bone, connective tissue, or muscle?
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.860]   Do you look at things through the lens of
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.960]   anterior chain, posterior chain, hypertrophy, strength?
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.340]   I would just like to get your sort of
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.380]   high-level conceptualization of this thing
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.700]   that we call fitness with the idea in mind
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.660]   that most people would like to have
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.980]   some level of endurance, some level of strength,
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.980]   and feel healthy, and presumably look
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.220]   however they wanna look,
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.020]   but let's set aesthetics aside for the moment.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.900]   How do you think about this thing we call fitness?
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.980]   - Well, first of all, Andrew,
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.700]   strength is the mother quality of all the other qualities.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.740]   So this is, again, it's a statement by
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.760]   Professor Matveev, Leonid Matveev, going way back,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.420]   and without a foundation of strength,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.660]   you cannot build anything.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.620]   So any athletic event requires a base of strength.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.220]   Of course, that shot putter's gonna need
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.020]   much more strength than triathlon athlete,
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.260]   but they all need strength.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.300]   Speaking of which, in triathlon, in marathon running,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.420]   in distance, in cycling, it's been proven that
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.420]   putting athletes on a heavy, low-repetition strength regimen,
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.060]   the kind that doesn't really add muscle,
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.700]   but just makes you stronger neurologically,
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.420]   and it makes them race faster.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.420]   So once you're stronger, everything becomes easier.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.660]   How much stronger you need to get, that will vary.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.220]   In the Soviet Union, they had something called
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.900]   the model athlete.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.260]   So they figured out that for every particular event,
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.580]   your odds of succeeding are gonna be much higher
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.320]   if you're able to squat this much, or bench this much,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.140]   and jump this high, and so on and so forth.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.540]   And this is easy enough to find these numbers
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.140]   for your individual sport, and talk to various coaches.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.900]   For people who are not competitive athletes,
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.700]   who just want to enjoy life,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.100]   you just need to think about having a reserve of strength
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.940]   for whatever it is that you might do.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.940]   So look at some PT standards in, let's say, in the military,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.340]   or in law enforcement,
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.580]   and possibly apply them to yourself.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.100]   I don't want to impose my set of standards,
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.140]   because there are many different,
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.620]   like I might prefer pull-ups in X and Y and Z,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.500]   but if we're looking at strength as the foundation
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.940]   for general physical preparation, right?
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.320]   So there's such a thing as general strength preparation,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.620]   that's part of that.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.180]   There's also special strength,
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.780]   which is sport-specific work, that's different.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.300]   And there are different ways of getting this done.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.880]   But as you and I know that certain exercises
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.660]   are going to have a great carryover
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.200]   outside these particular exercises.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   So as long as you're mobile, as long as you're symmetrical,
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.220]   and those are the things you have to address first,
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.860]   you need to look into work of a great cook, for example,
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.480]   then strength has to be your priority.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.540]   Once you have reached a certain level of strength
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.020]   that's appropriate for your sport,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.740]   or appropriate for your lifestyle,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.260]   at that point, you can just maintain it
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.180]   and focus on other qualities.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.040]   So I will give you an example.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.340]   Soviet scientists, Vysotsky and Denisenko,
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.340]   they measured a number of athletes in 20 different sports,
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.260]   athletes of different levels.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.860]   So they evaluated various quality.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.780]   One was absolute strength.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.060]   Another was rate of force development, pretty much power.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.740]   And the third was, is the rate of muscular relaxation.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.900]   So how quickly the muscle can relax after contraction,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.940]   which is very, very important.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.940]   And they have found that strength grew just very little
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.620]   from the intermediate level to the advanced level.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.500]   There's not a lot of improvement.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.980]   Power increased a little bit more,
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.780]   but the speed of relaxation is just shot up
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.080]   as the athlete became more advanced.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.000]   So it's again, so strength, it is the mother of all qualities
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.380]   but that's not the end all for everybody.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.260]   So reach the level that is appropriate
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.900]   for your sport or activity,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.700]   then just maintain it efficiently
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.820]   and focus on something else.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.580]   If we talk about strength, if we can talk about
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.220]   other qualities, or we'll get to them later.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.820]   - What movements do you believe, if they exist,
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.580]   all people should include in their weekly routine,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.580]   someplace when thinking about how to develop,
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.540]   perhaps maintain, but for most people,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.380]   it's going to be the goal of still achieving some strength.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.220]   - Okay.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.940]   - Strength increase, excuse me.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.820]   - I think there has to be a very low quantity of exercises,
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.540]   just very few exercises you wanna focus on.
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.860]   And I'm gonna give you some options to choose from.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.020]   So what we try to do at Strong First in my company,
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.820]   my school of strength, is we try to provide people
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.500]   with various simple, very low tech,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.140]   high concept ways of addressing, reaching their needs.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.480]   Because for one reason or another,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.340]   for this individual, the barbell is the preferred tool.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.260]   For another, it's the kettlebell or bodyweight
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.940]   or something else.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.140]   So I'm not going to say that if you don't do
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.660]   kettlebell swings or barbell squats,
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.060]   you'll never amount to anything, that's just not true.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.860]   But you can pick some, you can pick some events.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.340]   So you definitely ought to do something
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.380]   for your posterior chain.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.680]   You absolutely do.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.160]   If we are looking at the barbell,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.700]   I would start out with the narrow sumo deadlift.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.020]   - So this is narrow grip, but--
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.220]   - Not narrow grip, pardon me,
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.140]   but your stance is just wide enough
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.500]   to let your arms through.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   Your arms stay parallel to each other.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.860]   And so you just find a very comfortable stance for yourself.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.060]   So Professor McGill has been in your podcast.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.540]   He explained to you about the, you know,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.560]   different hip architecture and so on.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.360]   So you have to find whatever works,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.020]   whatever works for you.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.280]   And when people talk about functional strength training,
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.620]   and then they start standing on a bowl
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.480]   and juggle oranges, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.020]   because that doesn't look like my life
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.460]   or yours probably, right?
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.900]   But if you have to get a heavy bag of groceries
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.980]   or something, you got a deadlift.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.040]   And the narrow sumo deadlift,
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.540]   so if you look at power lifters,
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.340]   an example would be, classic example would be Ed Cohn.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.060]   That's a narrow stance sumo.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.220]   I'm not talking about wide sumo,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.180]   that's a very sport-specific event.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.820]   And you practice that first.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.820]   You learn how to hip hinge.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.800]   It's extremely important to learn how to hip hinge.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.420]   Again, Stuart stressed that how important it is
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.860]   for your back health and for your longevity.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.460]   So you learn to do that.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.100]   Then whether you decide to pursue the deadlift or not,
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.620]   if you decide not to pursue high numbers in the deadlift,
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.940]   maybe it's not appropriate for you,
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.420]   or maybe you're lacking the coaching.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.700]   Fantastic exercise for everybody is the Zurcher squat.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.900]   So in the Zurcher squat,
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.180]   you hold the bar like this in the crux of your elbows.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.220]   So it's resting right here.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.180]   It's possible to pick it up off the ground,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.180]   but it's an advanced skill.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.020]   It's an advanced skill.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.840]   Better just to walk it off the rack.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.520]   The advantage of the Zurcher squat
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.220]   over let's say the back squat or the front squat
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.420]   is even if you have messed up shoulders,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.780]   wrists, elbows, you still can do that.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.820]   Coaching the Zurcher squat is very easy, very simple.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.100]   And you have tremendous reflexive stabilization
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.020]   of your midsection.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.860]   It's just very, very powerful.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.980]   So you acquire that skill of getting tight.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.900]   So getting high numbers on that exercise in the Zurcher,
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.420]   so let's say an athlete could shoot for double body weight,
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.620]   that's a really good goal.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.900]   And the bar for those listening, not watching,
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.020]   is cradled in the crux of the elbows in front of the body.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.540]   Are the arms crossed?
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.860]   - You can hold them like this.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.980]   You can hold them like this
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.280]   or different ways of holding them.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.580]   You definitely would wanna get proper coaching.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.500]   You don't wanna bruise yourself.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.340]   You wanna be comfortable.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.580]   You wanna do it right.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.460]   But it's not, doesn't take a lot of skill to do that.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.940]   You find some pressing exercise.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.260]   And again, if we're sticking with the example
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.420]   of the barbell, the bench press has gotten bad reputation,
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.100]   thanks to the gym bros.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.100]   And all gym bros do is they bench pretty much.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.700]   Well, these days they also check out their phones, I guess.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.500]   - Every set, between every set.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.440]   The 11th rep, I joke, is people checking their phones.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.420]   - Yeah, there we go.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.500]   But if you look at athletes,
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.120]   athletes who also do some lower body work,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.020]   some posterior chain work,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.540]   and something for the midsection,
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.020]   and again, Zurcher's quote could address that,
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.460]   they are making a great use of the bench press.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.300]   So it's nothing.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.220]   It's a very simple exercise.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.260]   Well, not very simple.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.540]   It's a relatively simple exercise.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.180]   And unlike other pressing exercises,
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.900]   it allows you to make strength gains
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.380]   with a very low volume of training.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.900]   So you can do several sets of five once a week
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.900]   in the bench press and keep getting stronger.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.660]   Good luck doing that in the overhead press
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   or in the one-arm pushup or something like that.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.260]   So those are just a couple examples.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.360]   There are many other examples.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.880]   You can do snatch grip deadlifts.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.040]   You can, the list is very, very long.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   We can address the same thing in the same way
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.880]   with kettlebells.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.800]   You can look at the bodyweight exercises.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.520]   But you need to find several exercises
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.280]   that have a reputation for building strength
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.400]   that reaches beyond the ability to do this exercise.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.040]   If you just do curls, you know, you're gonna do,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.320]   you're gonna get better at curls, but not at much else.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.080]   So Canadian scientist back in the '80s,
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.360]   Digby Sale and his team made some interesting discoveries.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.080]   And again, they just found that doing something
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.360]   like extension is not gonna carry over to the squat.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.380]   It's just not.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.020]   The coordination is so radically different.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.960]   So you find several exercises that you enjoy
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   that don't hurt you, that you have the equipment available,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.620]   that you got the proper coaching for,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.280]   and you pretty much stick with them.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.880]   And there is absolutely no reason
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.740]   for you to change these exercises.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.640]   It's possible to change them on the margins, you know,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.780]   from a wide grip bench press to narrow grip bench press,
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.080]   squats with a pause and so on and so forth.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.320]   But you don't really have to do a great variety of things.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.000]   Variety is a good topic, we can discuss this later.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.160]   But like looking at the example of weightlifting,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.680]   as much as we can find many reasons
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.240]   why variety could be beneficial,
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.720]   improve neuroplasticity, reduced risk
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.960]   of repeat of strain injury and so on,
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.720]   but so is the statistics in weightlifting.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.280]   There's no correlation between the number of exercises
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.660]   and the platform results.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.520]   And for people outside the sports, it's gonna be the same.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.200]   So find this limited, just limited battery of exercises
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.880]   that you can do well, you can do pain-free,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.400]   and just enjoy them for years.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.960]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.040]   and thank our sponsor, Eight Sleep.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.780]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.400]   with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.960]   Now I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.160]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.880]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.180]   Now, one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.680]   is to ensure that the temperature
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.760]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.880]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.700]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.360]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.960]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.120]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.680]   about one to three degrees.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.960]   Eight Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.400]   of your sleeping environment
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.200]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.800]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.760]   middle and end of the night.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.560]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.120]   for nearly four years now,
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.840]   and it has completely transformed
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.800]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.080]   Eight Sleep recently launched their newest generation
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.920]   of the pod cover called the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.960]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.920]   I find that very useful
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.680]   because I like to make the bed really cool
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.600]   at the beginning of the night,
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.400]   even colder in the middle of the night,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   and warm as I wake up.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   That's what gives me the most slow wave sleep
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.600]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.280]   It also has snoring detection
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.440]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.000]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.160]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.560]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.120]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.680]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.200]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.360]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.120]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.680]   how different foods affect your health
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.120]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.200]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.500]   One of the most important factors
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.480]   in both your short and long-term health
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.880]   is your body's ability to manage blood glucose
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   or blood sugar.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.080]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.740]   you wanna keep your blood glucose steady
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.000]   without big spikes or crashes.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.320]   I first started using Levels about three years ago
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.880]   as a way to understand how different foods
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.800]   impacted my blood glucose levels.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.420]   And it's proven incredibly informative
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.280]   for determining my food choices,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.860]   when I eat specific foods,
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.880]   and how I time eating relative to things like my workouts,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.040]   both weight training and cardiovascular training,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.160]   things like running,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.700]   and when to eat before I go to sleep
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.340]   to allow for the most stable blood sugar
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.460]   throughout the night.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.340]   Indeed, using Levels has helped shape my entire schedule.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.440]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.240]   and trying a CGM yourself,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.480]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.560]   Levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.860]   and has even better tracking than before.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.200]   Right now, they're also offering
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.480]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.840]   Again, that's levels.link, spelled L-I-N-K, /huberman,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.700]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.840]   Would a combination across the week of some sort of squat,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.300]   let's say the Zurcher squat,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.080]   perhaps a kettlebell swing or something else
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.200]   for a posterior chain pull-up and dip
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.960]   be a fairly comprehensive program?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.960]   - I'm a fan of dips.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.800]   I like dips a lot.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.960]   I heard you say that you were,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.840]   some years ago you said that you were using dips
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.780]   for economy of time.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.480]   And I started getting into dips.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.440]   I haven't quite figured out the best way to load dips once,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.120]   because once you get past 15, 20 repetitions
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.040]   of the body weight dip, it gets,
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.880]   I don't know, it turns into something else.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.960]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.720]   - It turns into aerobic exercise, perhaps.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.240]   - Well, Luke Ames, he was a powerlifter
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.920]   from the golden age of American powerlifting.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.840]   He says, "Anything over six reps is bodybuilding."
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.120]   - Yeah, I'm trying to stay in the lower rep range today.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.040]   I'll talk about this with you more,
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.720]   because I think a growing number of people,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.080]   both men and women who are starting to do weight training
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.800]   or really incorporate strength training into their program
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.040]   are seeking a combination of strength
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.880]   and perhaps endurance as well,
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.520]   without putting on too much size.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.280]   Maybe size in some select body parts.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.120]   - Well, Andrew, I think they need to do
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.520]   possibly several different types of training.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.280]   But going back to your examples,
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.600]   dips are fantastic if you can,
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.880]   if your shoulders can handle them,
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.320]   if you know how to do them.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.120]   It's a great exercise, but not particularly democratic.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.200]   That's the problem.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.560]   So either you can do it safely or you can't.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.120]   And possibly, it's possible to coach some people
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.200]   to do the dip.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.120]   So if you're coaching somebody to do the dip,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.320]   the first prerequisite is to build up
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.900]   to a full skinned cat.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.440]   So it means you're hanging upside down,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.160]   you know, look up what it means, folks, on a bar.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.020]   So you gotta be able to get yourself in that position.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.720]   So if you're able to do that,
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.680]   and if you're able to get out of the position,
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.800]   you know, strongly and confidently,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   there's a good chance that you can start up and doing dips
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.240]   and be coached into that.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.440]   If you can't, probably not.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.240]   So either try to build up to that,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.000]   unless there are medical restrictions or not.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.520]   You mentioned the example of pull-ups.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.920]   Absolutely, pull-ups are one of the best
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.940]   general strength exercises.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.980]   And again, to your listeners, general versus special.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.140]   Special, in Soviet terminology, just means sport-specific.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.900]   So the carryover, when you start doing pull-ups,
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.940]   when you excel at pull-ups or the dips,
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.620]   you are going to get a carryover
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.300]   so far beyond this exercise,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.980]   which is exactly the reason you do that.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.460]   So I like your choices very much, yeah.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.940]   - What about specialized training for grip strength?
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.280]   I believe that if somebody's large,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.080]   if they can squat 500 pounds,
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.840]   if they can deadlift 600 pounds,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.800]   I don't really care if...
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.400]   The question is, can you open the pickle jar?
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.240]   - Sure.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.080]   - This is a critical home test.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.460]   - I just get my wife to do it.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.760]   So grip strength is extremely important,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.440]   and you being a neuroscientist,
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.680]   you know the disproportional representation
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.360]   in the motor cortex of your gripping muscles
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.520]   and the forearm and everything.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.940]   So, and there is another reason why grip is so important.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.540]   So if you make a fist, if you make a very tight fist,
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.420]   you're going to feel the overflow of tension,
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.500]   irradiation going to other muscles.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.380]   So pretty much by gripping tighter,
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.740]   you are instantly increasing your strength
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.420]   in anything that you do.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.180]   And so a very simple example for listeners,
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.640]   take some pedestrian exercise like curls.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.680]   And do as many strict reps as you possibly can
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.580]   the way you normally do them.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.620]   And then start just crushing that bar or that dumbbell
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.580]   or whatever that you're curling,
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.800]   you will immediately be able to knock out several more reps.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.200]   So that makes you so much stronger.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.780]   And again, the value of a strong wrist and grip
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.440]   is obviously very important.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.080]   For whatever reason, obviously it correlates with longevity.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.240]   We don't know why.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.120]   We have no idea.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.280]   Correlation is not causation,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.600]   so we don't know whether getting a stronger grip
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.640]   is going to make us live longer,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.480]   but statistically it's worth a try, right?
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.480]   So one can either find exercises that train the grip
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.080]   in the context of developing something else
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.580]   or train the grip directly.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.600]   So either way is great.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.240]   So the first examples would be climbing the rope
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.600]   or doing pull-ups and weighted pull-ups on a rope.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.000]   That's a great way to train, obviously.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.260]   So what you do, the way you program it is,
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.840]   let's say once a week you climb the rope
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.560]   and a couple of days a week you do pull-ups.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.160]   That's a good way to go about it.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.360]   And you don't need to do anything else.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.720]   And another example would be some exercises
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   like the kettlebell snatch.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.020]   When you start snatching a heavy kettlebell
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.880]   and you drop it from overhead,
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.720]   that eccentric loading is very, very powerful.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.680]   And that develops grip very, very well.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.280]   And again, right now we're talking more about
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.920]   what people in the grip world call the crushing grip.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.560]   You know, how you squeeze something.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.960]   There are other types of grip that they differentiated,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.220]   but this type of crushing grip is what's going to help
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.860]   most athletes and non-athletes the most.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.860]   And I will also warn you that hanging on the bar
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.940]   and doing farmer's carries,
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.400]   beneficial as they are for many reasons,
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.960]   it's not going to do that much for developing the grip.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.800]   - Interesting.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.160]   I started incorporating farmer's carries
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.520]   thinking it was gonna improve my grip, but.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.560]   - They're healthy.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.120]   If you look at McGill's work,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.480]   he will tell you that carrying two heavy objects,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.240]   it's going to really pound your spine.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.120]   But on the other hand, asymmetrical carry,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.240]   it appears to be very beneficial.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.920]   Then there's another interesting example.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.360]   Now, right now, I'm not talking about grip training at all.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.080]   Not even talking about strength training,
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.000]   but I'm talking about sort of a former run.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.840]   Dr. Mike Prevost, who used to work
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.200]   for the U.S. Marine Corps Navy,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.240]   he developed this very interesting protocol
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.560]   and a test called the kettlebell mile,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.600]   where you take a kettlebell
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.120]   that's approximately 30% of your body weight,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.480]   and he has good reasons why it has to be that way.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.760]   And you pretty much run with this kettlebell,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.120]   and you switch hands as much, as often as you want.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.120]   And it's a fantastic way to improve your running posture,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.280]   to develop very stabilizing muscles,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.560]   and to improve your ability to rock,
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.600]   but it doesn't beat you up as much rocking does.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.080]   You know, rocking, carrying heavy weight,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.760]   that's, it's rough on the body.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.680]   So it's a fantastic way,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.560]   it's a fantastic way to train your endurance,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.840]   an additional way.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.200]   - How heavy is the kettlebell that-
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.240]   - 30%.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.160]   Because he says when you start going heavier,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.800]   it's going to affect your gait.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.880]   So you're not really, you know,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.160]   you have to kick your hip over to the side.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.040]   It becomes something else.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.120]   - That's a heavy kettlebell.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.200]   - 30% of your body weight?
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.560]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm 210 pounds.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.680]   It's not trivial.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.640]   It's probably something like 62 pounds
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.200]   or something like that, 70 pound kettlebell.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.040]   It's not, no, no, no.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.960]   It's not trivial by any means,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.260]   but it's also not something you jump into immediately.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.400]   And also what's very cool is,
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.560]   because you get to switch hands very often,
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.040]   you are not destroying your QL
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.320]   and other stabilizers that are contracting isometrically.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.800]   And so what we're doing right now here
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.640]   is kind of a form of anti-glycolytic training.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.880]   If you can muscle contracts briefly and then relaxes,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.680]   contracts, relaxes, and the contraction cycles
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.640]   are really short, you're able to avoid glycolysis.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.920]   You're able to keep that muscle working aerobically
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.400]   for a long time and not beat yourself down.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.040]   So to the listeners who'd like to try it,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.600]   start by walking with a kettlebell,
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.200]   pass, you know, switch hands often,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.880]   then eventually build up to running
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.400]   and obviously build up gradually.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.440]   - Held like a suitcase?
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.080]   - Yes, only, only like a suitcase.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:13.920]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.140]   There's a podcast led by a guy named Cam Haines.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.980]   He's a bow hunter.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.320]   He's one of the people that really brought extreme fitness
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.000]   and ultras to the sport of bow hunting
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.160]   and is legendary there.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   And for his podcast, he has,
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.480]   he carried the 72 pound rock up,
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.000]   it's about a thousand feet of elevation
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.160]   in the Oregon wilderness.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.440]   And I've done it.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.640]   It's hard because of the shape of the thing.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.480]   And so you're moving it from shoulder to, you know,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.240]   to football carry, to, you know, infant carry.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.120]   And you're not talking about that.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.360]   You're talking about suitcase on the right.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.080]   Are you trying to crush the grip while you're doing it?
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:47.920]   - No, you're not.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.940]   No, this is not, this is not developing a grip whatsoever.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.220]   - And you're running at 10, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.020]   - Well, his goal, he says, run for a mile.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.980]   That's the goal.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.500]   And he has some numbers.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.340]   I can give you a link.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.160]   You can look it up.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.380]   - Great. - Back to Mike Prevost.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.900]   And direct grip strength training is great as well.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.700]   So for example, the best products with that would be
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.980]   the captains of crush grippers from Iron Mind, Iron Mind.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.280]   Iron Mind is the company that started
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.020]   the serious grip training pretty much in modern era.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.840]   And their grippers are the golden standard.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.200]   Some years ago, my colleague at Strong Force,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.560]   Brad Jones and I, we decided to get serious about it
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.920]   and see what that feels like.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.800]   And we spent many, many months.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.760]   We were both able to build up to closing the number three
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.280]   gripper from a parallel set.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.040]   So that means that gripper takes 280 pounds to close.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   And when you're using very small muscle groups,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   it's extremely, extremely hard.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.400]   And the observations that we both made
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.060]   and other colleagues and people have made
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.220]   that once you are able to do that,
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.900]   everything becomes so much easier.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.780]   However, the training itself is extremely hard.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.800]   Because people are thinking that when you're training,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.900]   the grip is just some kind of isolated thing.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.700]   You can drive the car and you can kind of squeeze
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.300]   this little pink thing that you picked up
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.260]   at the department store.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.940]   No, when you train with a heavy-duty gripper
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.740]   like the one from Iron Mind, it's a full-body effort.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:19.220]   And you need to use pretty much every neurological trick
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.540]   in the book in order to exert yourself.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:30.220]   So for example, if you have ever seen the San Chin stance
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.500]   in karate, which is a stance where the knees are kind
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.860]   of pulled inward and shoulders are pressed down.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.740]   There's a lot of tension.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.220]   Everything's very, very seriously engaged.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.180]   The toes are gripping the ground.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.540]   So you're pretty much gripping the ground with your toes.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.060]   You're contracting your glutes.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.100]   You're bracing very, very hard.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.220]   You're compressing your viscera.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.420]   Your lat is firing.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.300]   And you're sending all this effort.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.860]   The only thing, they're not working.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.460]   Like, you try to keep your traps and face out of this.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.940]   And you're directing this effort into your grip.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.260]   You get just as tired from doing that work
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.660]   as from doing, like, heavy squats or something.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.780]   That's remarkable.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.580]   But if you like that, it's a fantastic thing to do.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.660]   The motor neuron recruitment that you are describing
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.980]   is phenomenal.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.900]   I have one reflection on this relationship between grip
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.260]   strength and longevity.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.580]   Just a little bit of neuroscience.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.780]   You may be familiar with this.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.020]   So forgive me if you are, but for the listeners as well.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.300]   The motor neurons that control movement of the torso
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.100]   lie closer to the midline on both sides of the spinal cord.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.860]   The motor neurons that are responsible
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.900]   for more distal muscles, that is further from the midline,
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.580]   sit outside of those.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.820]   And so as you get out to the movement of the digits,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.380]   you know, the fingers and toes,
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.980]   those are the most distal from the midline.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.740]   The rate and pattern of degeneration of motor neurons
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.620]   as a function of aging, even if there's no ALS
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.340]   or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or anything,
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.820]   is always outside in.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.860]   We don't know why this is.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.420]   It may relate to the presence of the enzyme SOD,
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.420]   superoxide dimutase, but it does seem that people
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.980]   that train their peripheral strength,
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.100]   they can offset some of that outside to in,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.300]   or distal to more close to the midline degeneration.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.460]   So I believe, and this is just a belief,
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.700]   that it's not just correlative,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.740]   that when one trains their periphery,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.500]   they actually can offset some of the degeneration.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.940]   It's also the way it's mapped in the brain,
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.780]   which is a kind of a discussion outside of here.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.060]   We'd need to get some diagrams up
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.260]   for people to really conceptualize that.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.100]   But it's also the case if you look at older people,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.700]   70, 80, 90, their calves are generally atrophied,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.260]   even if their torso is still very thick and muscular
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.100]   if they did training.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.140]   So I feel like obviously training the core
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.700]   and the torso is so key, but training the peripheral muscles,
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.740]   at least from the perspective of longevity,
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.140]   it makes sense why that would be important.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.060]   - Well, there are so many reasons, obviously, to do that.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.580]   So I think that whether you choose to do that directly
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.300]   with grippers, or, and there are some other devices,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.100]   obviously, unlimited number of devices and exercises,
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.260]   or as a part of another exercise, like climbing the rope,
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.100]   definitely strongly encouraging your listeners to do that.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.420]   - I'm gonna try this running
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.420]   with the kettlebell on one side for,
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.780]   I'll go out for a mile with it on the right, and then-
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.220]   - Oh, no, no, you switch all the time,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.740]   switch as much as you want.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.300]   Because if you try to do it on one side,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.780]   you're going to pound your stabilizers,
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.260]   just pound them, you're not gonna recover forever.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   And this way, this is one of the secrets
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.660]   to developing isometric endurance,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.900]   is very rapid switching, you know, short contractions,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.940]   and brief rests, and over and over and over.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.020]   That way you're not, you know,
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.900]   the muscle doesn't go into ischemia and, you know,
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.820]   keeps getting oxygen pretty much.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.580]   - I'd like to talk about concentric
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.340]   versus eccentric portions of a movement,
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.540]   concentric generally being the lifting phase,
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.440]   and eccentric, of course, folks, the lowering phase.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.580]   Is there a case for just doing concentric movements?
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.420]   - Yes.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.060]   - Is there a case for emphasizing the eccentric portion?
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.900]   How does one balance those when thinking about soreness,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.820]   recovery, and frequency of training?
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.100]   - Okay.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.180]   Well, first of all, the case for concentric only
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.180]   is if you're trying to minimize muscle growth,
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.580]   and if you also are trying to minimize soreness.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.700]   So for athletes in weight classes,
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.140]   or athletes in sports where you get punished
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.140]   by carrying extra weight, it's a very good idea.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.820]   So for example, when Barry Ross coached Alison Felix,
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.740]   at that point she became the fastest,
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.700]   she won the 200 meters in the world,
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.220]   she was 17 years old, I think, she was the youngest.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.340]   And so he would have her do deadlifts,
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.980]   and they were concentric only,
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.620]   and she would have her drop the bar.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.500]   And the reasoning for that is exactly that,
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.580]   you're able to get stronger,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.380]   you're not putting on extra muscle mass,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.700]   also it's safe, it's really a very, very safe way to train.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.700]   And in programming a protocol for somebody
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.420]   who's not necessarily in that boat,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   it's still just for the sake of variety,
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.740]   you may want to choose to avoid the eccentric
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.900]   on certain days, like you're trying to recover,
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.260]   accelerate the recovery.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.540]   So you lift the weight, but then you step down,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.340]   so you could definitely do that.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.340]   Eccentric work, it's supposedly very helpful
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.460]   to promote hypertrophy,
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.140]   but there are a lot of ifs and buts in there.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.420]   I'm going to talk right now about the eccentric strength,
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.940]   eccentric work for strength, specifically.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.220]   It's very, because the muscle is strongest
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.520]   whenever you're lowering the weight,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.880]   it's very easy to do something knuckleheaded and get hurt,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.620]   which is, gym bros do that all the time.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.820]   And instead of doing that, what the wise,
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.220]   much wiser approach is to get a perfect spotter,
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.540]   great competent spotter, and put on,
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.980]   after you've done your normal couple
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.580]   of low repetition heavy sets,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.120]   add maybe five, 10 pounds over your maximum,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.900]   and make a perfect eccentric
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.840]   with an intention of lifting it.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.900]   So you're lowering this bar that you're just,
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.680]   you know, the bench press barbell.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.140]   You're lowering it to your chest and you're loading yourself
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.120]   like you're ready to press it back.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.220]   You pause on your chest without losing tension.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.400]   You're ready to blast it back.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.580]   And then your spotters take it off you.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.460]   And you do this about, do this about two, three times.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:55.900]   This sort of a strategy or a variation of it
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.180]   was used by Rick Will.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.220]   He was able to bench press over 500 pounds
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.180]   wearing a t-shirt at the body weight of Buck 81
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.060]   back in the '80s, one of the greatest bench pressers,
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.440]   who was extremely intelligent about his training.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.720]   And he did the same thing with his heavy attempts as well.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.400]   And incidentally, even better, not even better,
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.560]   I should say you do this in a different day,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.200]   when you combine this same type of eccentric
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.420]   with a very perfect assisted trap,
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.280]   not forced trap like bros do.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.000]   It's all you, bro, you know,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.560]   the guy's shaking there and dying.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.300]   No, so again, let's say that your best bench press
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.000]   is, you know, 315.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.700]   So you load up 325.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.660]   You lower it perfectly.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.460]   And you're lowering at the speed of your max attempt.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.580]   So you're not going very, very, very slow.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.680]   You know how guys do it.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.300]   They take the first quarter of the range of motion
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.160]   very slow and then they fall through.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.580]   That doesn't do anything at all.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:05.340]   No, you lower it at that rhythm of your maximal weight.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.920]   You pause and then you press it.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.840]   And your training partner gives you enough assistance
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.740]   to make it feel like it's about your 90%.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.640]   So the fact is you get to feel a super maximal weight,
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.400]   but you're not experiencing any psychological stress.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.600]   It's very, very powerful.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.520]   And again, you do this maybe for one or two singles.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.440]   This also ties with the Soviet research on gymnasts.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.320]   They came up with something
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.960]   called artificial controlling environment.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.060]   So they compared a group of gymnasts
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.680]   that was working up to some strength-demanding skill
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.160]   with doing typical regressions.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.740]   And at the same time, they were also
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.520]   working on typical strength training, weighted pull-ups,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.680]   and so on.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.640]   And the other group would have the coach provide
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.440]   this perfect assistance to enable
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.140]   the athlete to perform the skill at a higher level,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.940]   as they put it, living their motor future, motor future,
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.980]   but with enough help not to make it hard, but not stressful.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.940]   And the difference in gains were just dramatically.
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.180]   There was so much gain, so much faster.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.980]   So I would say that would be a very good way
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.420]   to use eccentric work.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.300]   Isometric training calls can also
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.620]   be very powerful for strength.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.980]   And a great value of isometric training
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.740]   is in its ability to coach you to lift properly,
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.180]   and not just lift properly, other athletic events as well.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.860]   If, let's say, that you're trying
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.820]   to learn to throw a front kick, and you're
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.780]   doing it all over the place.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.180]   But if you place your foot on a wall,
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.500]   and if your coach or sensei positions
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.860]   your body, your foot, in a certain way,
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.500]   and teaches you to start applying pressure
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.820]   to that wall and the ground at the same time,
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.180]   and kind of pulse it against the wall, adjust your body.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.300]   And then you relax, shake off your muscles,
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.260]   and you go hit the bag.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.300]   And suddenly, you're going to do so much better.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.880]   The same thing, let's say, that you're
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.340]   trying to optimize your position for the bottom of the deadlift.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.740]   So you load up more weight that you could possibly lift.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.780]   And then you wedge yourself under,
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.980]   and you start applying pressure.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.540]   And it doesn't feel good, so you change it a little bit.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:28.220]   So isometrics are very powerful for not just
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.140]   for strengthening the sticking points,
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.900]   but also for optimizing the angles.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.540]   Then we're also dealing with something
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.540]   that there is also a great disinhibition effect.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.220]   So what your listeners might not know is--
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.100]   so there are two--
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.180]   you have two pedals in your nervous system,
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.140]   as in-- pardon me for telling you this.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.540]   Obviously, you know all this.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.220]   But there is the excitation inhibition.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.340]   There's the gas pedal and the brake pedal.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.100]   And there are various influences,
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.220]   some of them psychological, but not all of them,
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.380]   that are taking away from your strength.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.060]   That's called inhibition.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.820]   And under certain circumstances, there
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.900]   are documented cases like a lady lifting off
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.660]   the front of a 3,600-pound car to save her son.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.780]   And there are documented cases of that.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.340]   So that disinhibition takes place.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.220]   So isometrics does have some disinhibition effects,
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.140]   properties, very, very powerful.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.260]   Also, isometrics teaches you to--
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.780]   teaches you not to give up on a heavy attempt.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.300]   Because if you put--
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.900]   the experiments were done in a safe manner on the machines,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   obviously.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.140]   But if you put an inexperienced person,
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:45.140]   and the machine is moving at a slow rate,
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.460]   so when the speed starts approaching zero,
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.060]   that inhibition takes place.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.500]   So pretty much the subject thinks the gig is up.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.740]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.220]   That's it.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:57.700]   I'm done.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.500]   I'm just giving up because I failed.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.580]   But training with isometrics allows
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.540]   you to develop this kind of a neural drive endurance
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.380]   that you need to grind through safely through a heavy attempt.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.020]   So very, very powerful.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.820]   How would you incorporate isometrics into it
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.020]   so you can do this as a part of your warm-up?
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.700]   You can also do paused reps.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.980]   They're fantastic.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.900]   When you combine eccentric, concentric,
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.900]   and isometric contraction all in one.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.180]   So perfect example for the squat, you lower to parallel,
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.540]   and you stay tight.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.180]   And you stay there for three to five seconds.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.780]   And then you explode upward.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.020]   So that's a great way to train.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.540]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor AG1.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.900]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.220]   with adaptogens. I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.700]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.220]   The reason I started taking AG1 and the reason I still
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.060]   take AG1 is because it is the highest quality and most
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.540]   complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.500]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.260]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins, minerals,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.900]   and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.260]   for your daily health.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.420]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics that support
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.860]   a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.900]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.860]   that align your digestive tract and impact things such as
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.220]   your immune system status, your metabolic health,
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.060]   your hormone health, and much more.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.060]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.260]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.860]   and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.080]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.300]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.700]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.940]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.140]   - I'd like to talk about neural drive.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:02.660]   I attribute you with popularizing, maybe you invented it,
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.220]   but certainly popularizing the term like greasing the groove
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.140]   in one of your books.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.060]   And by the way, we provide links to Pavel's books
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:11.940]   in the "Show Note" captions.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.700]   I'm a collector of your books.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.140]   - Thank you. - I love them.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.460]   Some of them are getting to be collector's items,
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.540]   they're a little bit harder to find,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.980]   but you'll have to compete with me on eBay.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.460]   But some of them can be found elsewhere
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.980]   and we'll provide links to those.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.980]   But this notion of greasing the groove
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.820]   completely changed my conceptualization of strength training.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.780]   - Thank you. - Because I was weaned
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.660]   more or less trying to run cross-country
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.060]   during the cross-country season.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.660]   Only ran it once, but I greatly enjoyed it
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.300]   and continued that sort of training.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.500]   Or trying to put on strength and size,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.460]   and kind of a numbskull, young male approach to things.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.140]   But it served me reasonably well.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.220]   I'm grateful that I included both.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.840]   However, I was so tuned to this notion
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   of training a body part, creating an adaptation,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.100]   then waiting for the adaptation to occur,
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.260]   and then training the body part again.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.820]   The arguments are all over the internet,
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.140]   two times a week, three times a week.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.380]   And then I came across this concept of greasing the groove,
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.980]   which as a neuroscientist felt so intuitively correct,
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.720]   and turns out to be correct.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.900]   You'll explain what it is,
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.940]   but the idea that more frequent training
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.180]   or practicing of a movement
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.580]   opens up a tremendous number of opportunities
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.300]   for development of strength,
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.380]   of size hypertrophy if one wants.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.940]   And I would say just generally more flexibility
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.980]   over one's total fitness program.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.300]   Once one understands this concept,
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.500]   you no longer look at this split, or that split,
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.060]   or this many reps, or that many reps,
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.380]   or this volume, or that volume.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.820]   All that is important,
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.820]   but you can start to think about it
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.720]   through the lens of the nervous system.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.300]   And to me, it was like water in a desert
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.740]   to finally encounter something
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.300]   that brought together all these different concepts.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.700]   So could you please explain for people
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.380]   what greasing the groove is?
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.500]   And then I think the implications of it will become obvious,
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.620]   but we'll also spell out what some of those are.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   - Andrew, please interrupt me,
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.620]   because this is about to become a,
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.940]   this might get really long.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.380]   So please interrupt me at any time.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.360]   So first I'll talk about the neural component.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.980]   Then we're gonna talk about the frequency
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.820]   and the morphological adaptation,
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.700]   structural adaptations as it leads.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.740]   So ladies and gentlemen, grease the groove.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.440]   We are talking about, let's use an analogy.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.580]   Let's imagine that you are a bow hunter
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.900]   and you're working in your garage.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.740]   And then you walk out of your garage
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.500]   and you shoot an arrow.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.900]   And you just go back to going about your business,
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.820]   working in your garage.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.700]   Or let's say you're a kid who practices martial arts,
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.040]   and on every break between classes,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.540]   you just go in the corner and you practice your kata.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.500]   This is the best way to practice your skill
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.340]   in small portions in a spaced out manner.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:57.340]   What's really fascinating is traditional education
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.660]   and traditional strength training,
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.060]   it's based on the cramming model.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.220]   So remember cramming for an exam.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.500]   So you're studying at night
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.460]   and you somehow squeak by and you pass it.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.300]   Okay, great.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.380]   And then a couple of days later,
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.740]   you happily forget everything.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.260]   So in contrast, imagine that you are,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.380]   let's say you're studying a foreign language.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.140]   You write words on cards,
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.500]   and at every opportunity you're standing in line
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.540]   in the bank.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.460]   So the lesser mortals are fooling around on their phones.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:28.620]   You're just going through your deck.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.020]   Like, oh, can I translate this word?
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.540]   I go put it back in the deck, flip it over.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.700]   The next time you're in some other place,
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.940]   you do this again.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.020]   So this is an example of space practice
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.980]   versus the traditional mass practice.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.980]   And the evidence of the superiority of space practice
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.140]   is just overwhelming.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.660]   It goes back to the 19th century,
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.140]   and there is at least like more than 1,000 papers
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.460]   published on that.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.640]   And still very few people do that, which is really sad.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.520]   And strength is a skill.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.340]   So two interesting things happened in the '50s.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.220]   One is Thomas Rush.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.300]   He was an American exercise physiologist.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   He proposed that strength adaptation was largely a skill.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.340]   And he looked at pretty much the adaptations.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.660]   He noticed that there's no correlation
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.380]   between the muscle growth and strength.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.900]   Then at the same time, a Soviet scientist,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.940]   Stepanov was his last name,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.580]   he was measuring the electrical activity
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.940]   in the muscles of weightlifters who are pressing overhead.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.660]   And back then, the press was one of the competition events.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.120]   And what he found is as the athletes got stronger
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.660]   after some months, the EMGs started dropping off
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.940]   when they're lifting the same weights.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.580]   So pretty much he found out that
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.580]   the nervous system activity became more economical.
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.300]   They were able to try less hard,
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.220]   yet still lift the same weights.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.100]   Or pretty much they could try harder
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.980]   and lift even heavier weights.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.060]   And hypertrophy could not explain that
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.940]   because in the '50s, the Soviets were very anti-hypertrophy.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.020]   They were just doing doubles, triples, singles pretty much.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.700]   So if we look at what's going on,
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.140]   it's the Hebbian mechanisms.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.980]   So pretty much every time that you activate
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.820]   a particular connection, synaptic connection
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:31.260]   between the neurons, that connection becomes stronger.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.180]   So if you do it over and over and over.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.780]   So the grease, the groove is the analogy
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.700]   is that command that's coming in
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.140]   from your brain to your muscles, that's the groove.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.700]   That's that pathway.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.220]   And the more you use it pretty much,
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.260]   the more grease it becomes.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.200]   So it's like becomes a superconductor.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.300]   So in the future, you don't have to try as hard
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.800]   to lift the same amount of weight,
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.900]   or you can try the same amount and you can lift harder.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.820]   So we haven't even addressed the neural drive yet.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.580]   We just pretty much made the motor neurons
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.540]   more responsive to it.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:06.380]   And it's a very easy and very simple way to train.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.260]   And strength comes very easily and very, very unexpectedly.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.700]   To make sure that it does happen,
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.100]   you have to address the issue of specificity.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.540]   So specificity pretty much means without getting too much
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.860]   into the weeds, to get stronger, first of all,
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.220]   you need to lift weights that are heavy enough.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.700]   And if you're looking about percentages of one rep max,
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.140]   we're looking at like 75 to 85 typically.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.460]   If you go too light, you don't make the impression
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.780]   on your nervous system.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.420]   And it's just not specific enough.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.900]   If you go too heavy, very quickly,
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.220]   you're just going to burn yourself out.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.860]   And so pretty much, it's a weight
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:50.220]   that's heavy enough to respect and light enough not to fear.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.740]   And the second of all-- and this is very surprising--
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.860]   is you only do about half or fewer reps
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.580]   that you possibly could do.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.980]   So for example, let's say that you're lifting
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.020]   80% of your one rep max.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:07.140]   And let's say that you're able to do eight reps maximum
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.660]   with it.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.020]   We're just fairly calm.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.140]   Well, you're only going to do about three to four reps per
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.060]   set, and that's it.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.860]   And the gym bros at this point go crazy,
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.700]   like, where's the intensity?
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.180]   Well, intensity in strength training
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.940]   is just how heavy the weight is.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.660]   It has nothing to do with the effort.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.380]   And it's been proven over and over
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.820]   that that's much more important than how hard you're
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:32.540]   exerting yourself.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   There are times for that.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.260]   There are absolute times for that.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.100]   But if the weight is heavy enough,
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.540]   and if you do half the repetitions that you possibly
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.420]   could do, you're going to get stronger.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.980]   It's very safe, and you're not going
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.780]   to burn out psychologically.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.020]   And it's also very easy on your body.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:56.060]   So also, that builds muscle as well,
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:59.700]   purely because you're able to do a very high volume of work.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.020]   I'm not able to explain the mechanism why it builds muscle,
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:07.940]   but as the Soviets found out in weightlifting research,
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.780]   there's a correlation between the volume and--
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.540]   Robert Truman-- between the volume and the hypertrophy,
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.060]   everything else being equal.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.620]   You're going to get bigger.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.420]   So almost every day, you're doing
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.980]   the sets of three, four reps, maybe even five,
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.900]   and they start adding up.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.820]   And before you know it, you're stronger.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.140]   And at the same time, you have developed muscle.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.300]   So to summarize the grease, the groove,
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.860]   you're trying to train moderately heavy as often
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.580]   as possible while staying as fresh as possible.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.140]   And if you decide to do it in the gym,
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.580]   a very simple protocol would be a set every 10 minutes.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.660]   It sounds really bizarre.
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.620]   Why?
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.860]   Why would you rest for so long?
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:56.580]   This apparently has to do with initial memory consolidation.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.460]   There's so much that's still unknown.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.860]   So we do know the grease, the groove works great.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.140]   But we speculate that some of it has
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.940]   to do with some of the same phenomena related
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.380]   to learning in other fields.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.940]   So if you're doing something over and over,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.940]   like you're saying 2 plus 2 is 4, 2 plus 2 is 4,
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.700]   you're just using your short-term memory.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.460]   You're not memorizing anything.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.140]   But if you say 2 plus 2 is 4, you go get a coffee,
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.140]   you come back, and you try 2 plus 2, 4.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.860]   So there's that desirable difficulty
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.780]   that you have in there.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.180]   And you have to process that instead of just
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.300]   go through the groove.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.340]   That apparently helps this adaptation.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.740]   So rest for at least 10 minutes.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.900]   Do sets of about the repetitions of half of what
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.980]   you're possibly able to do.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.860]   And listen to your body.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.140]   Typically, train two, three days in a row,
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.220]   and then take a day off.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.820]   But listen to your body.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.540]   Incidentally, this grease, the groove
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.620]   is the topic of my next book.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.500]   I have completed it.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.540]   It's not published yet.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.180]   If you look at--
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.780]   I can't pronounce the Hungarian professor's last name.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   Csikszentmihalyi.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.220]   Thank you.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:02.720]   Thank you.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.580]   I appreciate that.
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.380]   So he's talking about that perfect challenge,
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.980]   perfect practice lies in that channel
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.860]   between boredom and anxiety.
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.940]   So if you put yourself in that channel,
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.700]   and if you keep lifting this moderately heavy weights
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.260]   with a moderate effort over and over and over,
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.740]   you're going to get strong.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.780]   That's one of the many ways to get stronger.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.540]   Are you doing anything in the rest periods
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.580]   between these 10 minutes?
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:29.740]   So is it, let's say, bench press,
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.540]   wait 10 minutes till you bench press again.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.820]   But in the meantime, you're doing
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.340]   Zurcher squat five minutes after the first bench press?
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.700]   That's one of the way to do that.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.580]   You can do up to three exercises at the same time.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.620]   So let's say, Zurcher squat and the bench press,
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.940]   and maybe a third thing.
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.860]   But I'd say those two are enough.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.900]   And another option is you can do that.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.700]   You can incorporate this into-- if you would do only one
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.180]   exercise, you can squeeze it into your lifestyle
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.340]   or your athletic practice.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:03.500]   So for example, let's say you're teaching a track practice
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.540]   or martial arts class.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.220]   And every 10 minutes on the clock,
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.700]   you just have the class do--
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.300]   drop and do three hard--
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.620]   let's say three one-arm push-ups and then get back to the class.
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.260]   So there's no interference whatsoever.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.740]   In fact, it's better than no interference.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.100]   Back in the '60s, Soviets found out something
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.340]   called the strength after effect.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.540]   So if you do strength work that's not exhausting in nature
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.980]   and that's not novel to you, it has a tonic effect
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:36.780]   just for anything that you can do with your brain
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.540]   or with your body, anything.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.380]   So what they would even do-- some coaches
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.660]   would do so-called strength warm-up.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.380]   They would warm up, as usual, for a track class,
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.980]   let's say, track practice.
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.180]   Then they would do, let's say, three sets of three
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.340]   of something like with 80% max, which is not much.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.540]   And they start their practice.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.700]   Then the coach noticed that the athletes
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.940]   are starting to droop a little.
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.740]   He'll repeat that.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.780]   He might repeat that up to three times.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.860]   So what you have is by having this short, very small dose,
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.540]   like a nanopractice of strength, you rejuvenate yourself
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.540]   and your productivity increases so much.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.700]   So whether you want to just do the strength exercise,
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.100]   several of them in that one hour period,
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.460]   or whether you want to combine that
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:26.020]   with writing a great American novel, that's your business.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.700]   I suppose if someone has access to the appropriate equipment
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.740]   at home, you could incorporate Grease the Groove
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.620]   into your entire day.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.700]   That's ideal, yes.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.780]   And obviously, it's difficult with some equipment.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.620]   But what you could do, you could use the heavy-duty grippers.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.420]   You could do one-arm push-ups.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:45.260]   You could keep a kettlebell under your desk
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.540]   and press it at every opportunity.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.420]   And again, the idea is really just practice.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.780]   You just try to hit a perfect, perfect trap.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:58.100]   And notice that if you have some issues,
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.700]   if you're a warm-up-dependent person for orthopedic issues--
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.060]   I'm talking about warm-up and very much in the body,
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.260]   not the mind in this particular case--
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.020]   then it might not be appropriate for you.
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.060]   Although, with 10-minute rest, it might still be OK.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:18.460]   But practicing a skill without the warm-up,
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.580]   that means rehearsal, is very powerful for improving
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.620]   that skill.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.020]   People think they automatically equate performance
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.540]   with improvement, with learning.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.420]   But it's not so, not at all.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.140]   When you are doing something that's just out of the blue,
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:36.420]   it's the way a sniper would take a cold shot.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.020]   That's so much harder, because you have
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.620]   to have produced that solution.
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:46.540]   Or maybe an example that's closer to most viewers, golf.
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.260]   You go to the driving range.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.580]   You start hitting it.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.220]   And like, wow, you're amazing.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.620]   You just get yourself fine-tuned.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.500]   You hit.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.100]   You're perfect.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.260]   Then you go and you play the game.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.860]   And you cannot replicate that.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.980]   Because suddenly, different club, different topography,
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.420]   everything is different.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.220]   And you didn't have the luxury of that tuning yourself up
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.220]   right there.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.940]   So it feels-- it doesn't feel like you're stronger,
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.220]   but you are going to get much stronger.
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.640]   I've been eager to share with you some recent findings that
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.220]   are not my own, but that I think you might be curious about,
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.020]   and that I think most people, hopefully,
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.500]   will be curious about as well.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.940]   It's not greasing the groove specifically,
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.740]   but it provides a at least partial mechanistic
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.220]   understanding of how particular types of physical movement
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.260]   with this high motor neuron and attentional engagement
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.220]   can generate high levels of alertness that
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.740]   can be devoted to, as you say, writing the great American
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.260]   novel, perhaps.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.100]   There's a guy at the University of Pittsburgh
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.520]   named Peter Strick, who for the first time
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.540]   started to map the connections between the adrenals
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.380]   and the brain.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.460]   And he was able to do this using some really cool technology.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.380]   The basic takeaway is the following.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.580]   Adrenaline released from the adrenals,
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.700]   as some of the listeners may know,
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.420]   doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier.
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.020]   But it turns out it binds to receptors
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.700]   on the vagus, which then stimulates
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.980]   noradrenaline in the brain and provides this increase
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.620]   in alertness.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.620]   So then the question is, how do you get your adrenals engaged?
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.080]   We can sit here, and we can do a staring competition, which
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.140]   I'll lose for certain.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.740]   But there are all sorts of psychological tools.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.940]   Caffeine, et cetera.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.300]   There are all sorts of ways to-- cold water.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.500]   But it turns out what Peter found
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.100]   was that there are particular locations in the motor cortex
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.820]   that send basically a two-synapse connection,
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.360]   disynaptic connection, directly to the adrenals.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.340]   And the areas of motor cortex that engage the adrenals
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.180]   cause them to release adrenaline.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.580]   But just by sheer movement of particular muscle groups,
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.340]   the core, as you were talking about before,
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.820]   like bracing the core, causes the release of adrenaline,
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:50.540]   which then, via the vagus, causes the brainstem area
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:51.700]   to release more adrenaline.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.300]   Wake up the whole brain, essentially.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.900]   Increase learning and performance in anything.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:56:01.280]   And as well, the stronger and stronger activation
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.780]   of the motor neurons, deliberate activation
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.180]   of the motor neurons, seems to engage adrenaline release.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.140]   Now, to me, this was a wonderful way
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.820]   of trying to persuade people that they
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.860]   have internal control over this thing that we call motivation.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.020]   That movement itself can increase adrenaline,
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.980]   which can increase the tendency to want to move.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:17.900]   - As long as, again, you don't want
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.220]   to have too much adrenaline either.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:19.860]   - Right, right.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.740]   And I'd like to talk about that.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.900]   But I think I, and so many other people,
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.360]   were kind of raised and conditioned,
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.740]   at least in this country, to think,
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.020]   oh, if I want to increase my level of motivation,
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.380]   I need to, like, I don't know, watch an inspiring video.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.220]   That could be great.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.140]   Or I can drink caffeine, or an energy drink.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.740]   And certainly that will do it.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:42.640]   But to me, the discovery that particular movements
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.340]   and particular muscles being engaged in activity itself
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.140]   changes the neurochemical milieu,
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.620]   I mean, of course it had to be, right?
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:50.900]   It's a big duh.
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.220]   But I think that, anyway, I was excited to share
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.420]   with you this data. - Well, thank you.
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.420]   - I didn't discover them. - That is news to me.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.100]   - So I read "The Naked Warrior."
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:01.300]   I was closed when I read it, but it's a wonderful book
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.620]   because it talks about body weight, only exercises,
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.980]   and this concept of, for instance,
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:09.860]   like trying to crush one's fist on, you know,
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.160]   making a really strong fist on the other side,
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.260]   and how that will increase your gripping ability
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.780]   on the other side, this kind of thing.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.740]   - Yes, as you know, with your background in neuroscience,
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.020]   obviously, there's so many neurological phenomena,
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.980]   like if you can think of like muscle software
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.940]   that we have access to, that if we become conscious
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.580]   about accessing that, we can be so much stronger.
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.820]   - Yeah, so when you talk about doing a set
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.180]   of three or four repetitions, or two to three repetitions
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.900]   at about 85% or 80% of one mass, waiting 10 minutes,
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.100]   and then the intervening 10 minutes,
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:43.380]   going and trying to learn something important,
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.420]   or physical or cognitive, this makes perfect sense to me
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.140]   because of the relationship of adrenaline,
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:51.140]   but also the way that your entire nervous system
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.420]   has changed in the intervening period.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.060]   - And plus, you have the contextual interference.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:58.620]   So one of the Greaser group is now something
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.660]   that I invented, it's something that I was able to codify
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.260]   and explain and possibly refine,
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.940]   but it's been around since the day of Ecclesiastes,
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:10.140]   and specifically in strength training, Paul Anderson.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.060]   Paul Anderson, one of the greatest weightlifters
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:17.060]   of all time, he was a big favorite of the Soviet public.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.900]   Very tough group to impress,
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.260]   but they called him the wonder of nature, he was so strong.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:28.220]   And Paul Anderson would do a set of squats,
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.940]   then he would wander around, drink some milk,
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.980]   half an hour later, do a set of presses,
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.780]   then go do this again.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:38.140]   And so he reinvent, not should say reinvent,
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:43.140]   he invented without knowing neurons from nylons,
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.980]   many of the training concepts
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.860]   that are just cutting edge today.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.380]   And again, so this concept of contextual interference,
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   remember we talked earlier how,
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.660]   if it's harder for you to produce a solution,
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:57.220]   if you're trying harder to remember two plus two is four,
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.300]   or how to throw the ball, then you're gonna learn more,
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.900]   as opposed to if somebody just hands it out,
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.620]   two plus two is four.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.980]   So Paul Anderson had both the spacing,
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.340]   time came like, so the groove has been forgotten
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.780]   in the sands of time,
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.100]   and the contextual interference, he did another exercise
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.060]   that erased whatever previous groove right there.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.780]   And it's very fascinating how looking at some
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:23.980]   of these old timers and just how genius some of them were.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.140]   - Yeah, the unconscious genius aspect of it is so cool.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.940]   And of course, I don't wanna be disparaging
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.480]   of common gym programs these days,
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.080]   but I do feel like the way that most people train.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.920]   Yeah, he'll do that.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.820]   Yeah, the way that most people train in terms of thinking,
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.140]   okay, I'm gonna hit the gym three, four times a week,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.740]   or I'm gonna train chest one day and chest and biceps.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.140]   While that has some value,
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.580]   I feel like for creating all around strength
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.780]   and hypertrophy, there's just such an incredible
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.380]   treasure trove of other things
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:55.860]   that you're sharing with us today
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.800]   that are just not discussed as much
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.540]   because people don't take the lens
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.180]   of the nervous system component.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.580]   One thing that I'd love to ask about the nervous system
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.200]   in terms of training adaptation and recovery
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.220]   is that I was weaned somewhat
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.640]   under the thought patterns of Mike Mencer.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.480]   This was in the Dorian Yates era.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.840]   And I knew Mike a little bit.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.100]   I paid for a consult with him over the phone.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.340]   We never met in person.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.760]   So that had my mother asking,
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.680]   you know, why is this grown man calling our home?
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.280]   And why are you, in the old days,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.480]   you had to wire somebody money, so I do.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.760]   But it was so worthwhile because Mike taught me
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.320]   that the goal of training was to induce an adaptation.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.200]   Anything additional was not necessary.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.660]   And in his case, he felt was counterproductive.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.320]   Very infrequent training, et cetera.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.120]   And it worked tremendously well to take me
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.360]   from like 150 pounds to 210 pounds,
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.200]   which I had no need to do,
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.720]   but my body just reacted like crazy.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.680]   But then again, I was 16, 17, and 18 years old in that time.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.960]   Probably could have done any number of different things
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.400]   and experienced similar results, who knows.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.520]   But the concept, of course,
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.240]   is that you train to induce an adaptation,
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.400]   then you rest, and then you allow the adaptation
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.420]   to serve the, you know, moving higher poundages
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.720]   in good form, this sort of thing.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.400]   The problem, however, is that,
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.520]   and Mencer highlighted this,
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.380]   is that training of any kind, running, lifting, et cetera,
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.800]   taxes both the nervous system as a whole
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.360]   and the muscles locally in the connective tissue.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.440]   How should we think about training and recovery?
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.720]   So when you describe grease the groove,
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.460]   I could imagine if I had a home set up
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.300]   or I'm going to the gym,
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.320]   I could maybe do four or five rounds of this training.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.600]   But at some point, it becomes counterproductive.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.600]   So- - Wow, a lot of great questions.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.080]   - I'm just trying to think about
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.920]   how to schedule this sort of thing,
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.040]   keeping in mind that the nervous system fatigues as a whole,
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.280]   and then there's also the issue of local muscle fatigue
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.520]   or even the propensity for injury, if you just overdo it.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.400]   - Sure. - Yeah.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.880]   So if we could just riff on this for a little bit.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.400]   - If you don't mind, Andrew, I'll break it up
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.340]   because there are a lot of great questions right there.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.320]   So one, as you mentioned,
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.460]   there are different ways of training.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.560]   And again, we grease the groove load parameters
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.200]   apart from the long rests
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.800]   are very much based on Soviet weightlifting system.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   And I'd like to talk a little bit about that later.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.280]   Another system that is a completely and radically different,
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.740]   and it ties very much to Mike Mentzer's training
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.520]   for reasons that become obvious,
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.080]   is the classic American powerlifting system from the '80s.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.000]   And when people argue about training methods,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.800]   what they need to understand is
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.440]   there are many ways to get the job done.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.880]   You know, Art Kuvio, his research in Estonia found
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.520]   because there's so many different combinations of stimuli
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.360]   and the different adaptations that result,
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.840]   you can arrive to similar outcomes
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.120]   in a lot of different ways.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.760]   So to say this is right and this is wrong,
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.160]   you cannot sometimes do that.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.200]   I mean, I can say most of the things are wrong,
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.560]   but I can also say there's multiple right ways of training
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.600]   and they can be radically different.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.420]   And they're different
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.220]   because they rely on very different phenomena.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.240]   So in this particular case,
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.780]   you're talking about recovery and frequency,
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.780]   which is again, a great way to address it.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.060]   I'm gonna talk about two systems
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.260]   that are completely different
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.940]   and yet have that same pedigree
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.900]   that they have brought so many gold medals.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.620]   So one system is the Soviet weightlifting system,
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.220]   is again, where athletes would train several times a day.
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.780]   And Bulgarian system is a more extreme example of that
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.140]   and every day.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.580]   And the other extreme would be
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.860]   the American powerlifting system,
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.260]   exemplified by Hugh Cassidy,
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.860]   Marty Gallagher, Ed Cohn, Kirk Kowalski.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.360]   So starting from the '70s through the '90s,
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.920]   those are really glorious day for you as powerlifting.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.460]   And in that system, they would pretty much do
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.300]   one or two heavy sets per lift once a week.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.180]   So it's kind of a little bit like Mike Mancer's work,
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.900]   kind of, but we'll address why.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   So how can that be and how can both systems work?
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.380]   So you address the recovery.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.460]   There's a concept called heterochronicity,
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.060]   which hetero means different, chronicity refers to time.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.540]   So the different systems in the body
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.920]   recover at different rates.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.940]   And if you don't take that into account,
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.700]   then you're going to have some serious problems.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.060]   So the Soviet system took,
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.840]   if you look at the Soviet system with frequent training,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.380]   they looked at, okay, we want to do frequent practice,
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.620]   which is exactly what we do.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.380]   We don't want to beat the muscles up so much
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.580]   that it takes them very long time to recover,
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.540]   not too much eccentric stress,
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:41.680]   not too much acidosis, avoiding things like that.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.300]   And they were able to adjust the loads in such a way,
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.220]   so let's say your weights are heavy, but not too heavy.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.500]   The reps don't go too high,
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.300]   so you're able to recover pretty much overnight.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.740]   And the benefit of that is it's been shown
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:59.740]   that if you fragment a given workload
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.620]   over more days and more sessions, you get better results.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.500]   And your body is able and your nervous system,
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.180]   endocrine system, your carcass,
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.700]   everything is able to handle much more
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.620]   if it's split into small doses.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.940]   So let's use an example of a meal.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.860]   Let's say if you were trying to do an eating competition,
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.260]   how much you can eat in 24 hours.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.860]   So it's not like those Coney Island,
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.020]   how many hot dogs you can eat in one sitting, no.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.460]   But you would probably eat a lot more
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.220]   if you spread it throughout the day.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.700]   And this is the same idea.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.500]   Just like that parable from Nassim Taleb
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.940]   about the king that got angry at his son,
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.700]   and he says he's gonna crush him with a big rock.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.500]   And you realize, well, what did I do?
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.020]   I don't want to kill this kid.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.180]   But the king's word is king's word, right?
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:50.180]   So he ordered his peons to break up the rock into pebbles
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.420]   and then just dump these pebbles on the kid.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.380]   So that's the same idea.
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.700]   So fragmentation, the load always allows you
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.340]   to do more and do it safer.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.180]   So something else is related to that.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:05.820]   In some training systems,
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.660]   some training systems rely on adaptations,
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.580]   let's say for strength, that go in the muscle,
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.140]   that go beyond just the contractile proteins,
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:19.140]   just the part that create force.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.180]   So for example, the Soviet system,
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.780]   they also tried to increase the storage
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:28.020]   of creatine phosphate, which is the kind of immediate fuel
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.660]   for muscle contractions, for this type of work,
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.260]   for lifting heavy weights over and over.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.740]   And so by training sometimes easier,
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.660]   you're able to keep stimulating
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.260]   that creatine phosphate adaptation,
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.260]   but without the still allowing muscles to recover.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.940]   So this kind of a dance.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.940]   And it's fairly complex.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.660]   Then on the other hand,
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.820]   the American system did something completely different.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.060]   And the explanations for what happens
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.860]   in the muscle within this American system,
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.740]   we didn't know for sure,
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.140]   but there's a hypothesis by a Russian specialist,
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.460]   Vladimir Pyataschenko, that seems quite credible.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.700]   So here's, so again, the system, here's the system.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.740]   You train hard, you do one hard set once a week,
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.740]   or two hard sets.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:18.660]   So the satellite cells that are immature cells in muscle,
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.620]   they're sitting there waiting to jump in,
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.300]   if you need to replenish the messed up ones.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.140]   In order for the satellite cells to get their job done,
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.380]   they try to figure out, scientists try to figure out
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.300]   what sort of stimuli are required.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:40.100]   And one, a strong case can be made
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:45.020]   that a very particular damage to the microstructure
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.140]   of the muscle can provoke that stimulus.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:52.180]   But that damage has to be very specific.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.580]   If you beat up the muscle with a baseball bat,
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.260]   you're just gonna get a whole lot of scar tissue,
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.140]   and some satellite cells will just die,
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.660]   and others will just become scarred.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.780]   But if the cross bridges in the muscle,
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.140]   the cross bridges is that part
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.380]   that does create force in the muscle,
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.740]   if they do tear in a very specific way,
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.780]   it seems to do the job.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:18.180]   So the way the muscle contracts is, so there is,
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:22.500]   imagine that you're rowing a boat on the water.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.860]   So water is one protein, it's called actin,
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.700]   and myosin is the ores that are moving in there.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:34.500]   So the ore dips into the water, hooks, and pulls.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.780]   And that ore relies on available energy in the muscle,
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.540]   so these ATP molecules of stored energy,
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.380]   they're floating around.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:47.660]   And the head, myosin head, needs that ATP
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.220]   in order to bolt, to hook, to produce force,
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.580]   but it also, it needs ATP to unhook as well.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.820]   And it's in this in-between stage, it's called a rigor.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:01.020]   So whenever the muscle has produced force,
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.780]   but there is not enough energy for it to relax,
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.100]   so the muscle is stuck in rigor.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.620]   So think of rigor mortis.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:12.140]   So if you tear a dead body's muscle, it's gonna tear.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.900]   And supposedly, this is going to happen
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.180]   only when you're able to,
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.700]   when the consumption of ATP is really high in the muscle,
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.340]   but the supply is not.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.980]   And so if you do that in the first,
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:33.660]   let's say, 20, 30 seconds before acidosis set in,
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.860]   that's what should happen.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.900]   Because if you wait longer
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.420]   when there's a lot of acid in the muscle,
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   acid, it kills that reaction that uses ATP.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.380]   So you're not using as much anymore.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.980]   Sure, the demand is down, the supply is down,
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.940]   but so is demand, so it's not so good.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.580]   So if you raise that fatigue point,
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:58.060]   so if you try to deplete that creatine phosphate,
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.820]   that kind of rocket fuel of the muscle
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.260]   within about 20, 30 seconds,
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.260]   then presumably some of these hooks,
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.660]   some of these ores are gonna get stuck.
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.060]   And when the muscle's lengthening,
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.300]   and they're gonna tear.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.820]   And that's a very specific tear.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.340]   It doesn't happen on the outside of the muscle.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:15.060]   It happens just on the inside, in there.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.820]   Whether this is true or not, I do not know,
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.980]   but it's a pretty good theory
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.660]   that does explain Mike Mentzer's method
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:26.460]   and explains the American powerlifting method.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.020]   Interestingly enough about Mike Mentzer,
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.020]   and again, to the listeners who are not aware of the method,
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.700]   that means train the muscle really hard,
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.780]   very infrequently, with very low volume.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.980]   Professor Yuri Verkhoshansky, before he died,
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.780]   you know, famous Soviet sports scientist,
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.420]   known in the West mostly as the father
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.300]   of what is called plyometrics in the West.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.980]   But he's also done many other things as well.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.340]   He spoke very highly about Mentzer.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.940]   He thought Mentzer was brilliant.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.340]   Mentzer was an innovator.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:56.820]   But many people, some people get good results from it
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.020]   like you did, and a lot of people do not.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:04.860]   And so pretty much what Pratasenko suggested
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:09.980]   that might happen is eventually you'll reach the limit
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.700]   of adaptation of how much you can deplete,
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.460]   how much you can deplete the creatine and phosphate
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.300]   in that window.
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.140]   That's when you hit the wall.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.060]   And this is where the American system comes in.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.940]   This system is called cycling.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.420]   The history of cycling is fascinating.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:29.380]   The relationship, the interaction between the Soviet
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.620]   and American strength schools is absolutely fascinating.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.780]   So just to go back for a minute,
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.580]   Soviet track athletes in the '50s
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.980]   were using the typical stupid high rep reps to burn.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:47.860]   Then in the late '50s, some very sharp young specialist
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.140]   Vitaly Chudzinov, he made a case at a conference
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.580]   that what are we doing?
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.540]   Let's look at what, he said, let's look at Paul Anderson,
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.820]   Di Hebburn, Bruce Randall, these North American strengths.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.180]   Let's look what they're doing.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.820]   They're lifting heavy stuff for sets of three to five reps.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.620]   Let's knock this nonsense off.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:09.620]   Soviet track athletes started doing that right there.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.260]   So this is how the Soviets, for example,
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.180]   learned from Americans.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.100]   That's an example of how it went the other way.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:20.100]   The classic periodization, as it's known,
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.500]   Matveev's periodization, in which you kind of start out
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:28.020]   with higher volume and less specific to lower volume,
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.380]   more intensity and so on,
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.700]   that periodization is not used by lifters
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.020]   in the Soviet Union.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.300]   Lifters thought that's just completely not,
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.540]   it's just not usable.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.180]   It's just inappropriate for their needs.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.060]   Arkady Vorobyev, the professor and Olympic champion
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.540]   made a very strong case, why?
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   But Americans who got some limited information about it,
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.100]   American power lifters, not weight lifters,
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.420]   were able to develop their own training system
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.660]   based on that premise, something that the Soviets didn't do.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.420]   And the way it worked is like this.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.020]   You don't necessarily have very high volume,
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.060]   but you start, I'm gonna give you a most classic example
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.300]   of this type of cycling.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.300]   Again, this is Cassidy, Gallagher, Cohen-Karwoski.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:20.060]   Four week blocks, let's say there's gonna be three,
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.500]   four week blocks, maybe four.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.740]   So you do lift once a week.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:29.100]   On week four, you go for PR.
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.980]   So let's say this is a month of fives.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.620]   So this is on your week four,
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:36.940]   you're going to do a PR set of five, you plan for it.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.180]   Week three is somewhere around your old PR.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:44.180]   Week two is lighter, week one is lighter still.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.820]   Okay.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.500]   And then after that, you may increase the weight,
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.460]   but still relative effort is going to drop
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.660]   and you're gonna kind of repeat the process.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:58.460]   So it does multiple things.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:02.380]   On the muscular level, so what Pratasenko explained,
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:06.180]   you pretty much decondition yourself temporarily
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.980]   and you progressively increase that creatine phosphate use.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.460]   So initially, when you're deconditioned,
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.140]   it doesn't take as much to get the stimulus.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.780]   You don't have to push really hard in the first week.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.260]   You push harder in the second and harder and harder.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.780]   There's a concept, there are concepts in periodization,
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.820]   so in sports science, of reactivity versus resistance.
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:29.820]   Reactivity means how responsive your body is to the stimulus
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.740]   and resistance, kind of like in the medical terms,
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.540]   you know, how much it can, you know,
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.940]   it's not affected by it.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:41.580]   So when you're starting light after layoff,
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:44.900]   your reactivity is high and your resistance is low.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.180]   It doesn't take much.
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:48.540]   So boom, suddenly you build this muscle
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.660]   and then you keep building up.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.380]   And when you reach a peak,
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.220]   then you just step back again.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:01.060]   And on the side of the nervous system and endocrine system,
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.060]   much later Soviet research,
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:06.620]   they said you can train hard maximum two weeks out of four.
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:07.460]   That's it.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.420]   More than that, you cannot handle.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.180]   - So for every month, you're training-
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.140]   - Two weeks hard.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.300]   - The other ones you're cruising, you're...
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.140]   - Not as hard.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.820]   Sometimes easy, sometimes...
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.180]   There are different ways of programming it.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.860]   The typical one that you hear about in the West
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.540]   is you're gonna build things up for three weeks
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.500]   and then down in four.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.820]   It's one of the about 16 different possible arrangements.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.420]   Doesn't have to be.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.980]   There can be...
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.340]   Here's one brilliant way.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:36.540]   Franco Colombo, who passed unfortunately,
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.220]   was not just a great bodybuilder.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.620]   He was a great chiropractor and great strength athlete.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.820]   Super strong, very strong, and brilliant.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:47.660]   So he told me about his deadlift cycle.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:49.620]   Week one, moderate.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.020]   Week two, heavy.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.380]   Week three, moderate.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.180]   Week four, very heavy.
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:58.100]   Again, this is a different way of arranging the same concept.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:03.100]   And these American powerlifters were able to build a system
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:07.940]   that built the muscle probably exactly in this manner.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:11.140]   What was happening at the same time?
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.740]   Oh yeah, and there was also another angle
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.420]   how that system possibly has worked.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.500]   This is fascinating.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.860]   Any type of exercise that you do
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.540]   makes your muscles more slow to twitch.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.500]   It's just the way it is.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.980]   It's very, very bizarre, yeah.
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.340]   - Even explosive.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.180]   - Even explosive.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.740]   - Even just trying to crush the bar
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:29.860]   and drive the deadlift up.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.020]   - Even that, the more you do it.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.380]   So Goldspank's research back in the '80s
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:36.020]   that any cycle of stretching or contraction
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.060]   resets the heavy chain myosin,
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.100]   the contractile proteins that makes it towards slower time.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.380]   So any type of work.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.420]   If you do biopsy on somebody who is a couch potato,
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.940]   you're gonna find that person probably has
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:52.460]   a higher concentration of white fibers than you and I.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.940]   - Wild, very counterintuitive.
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.100]   - Very counterintuitive.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:58.180]   And so that's like a default setting for the fibers.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.380]   However, if you take time off,
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:06.380]   something changes, and it goes beyond the change.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.460]   So this research came out of Sweden, I believe,
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:14.460]   when they trained a group of subjects in strength.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.540]   They saw a predicted decrease in the ratio
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.540]   of type 2X fast-fit fibers.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.100]   Then they took a couple months off,
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.620]   and then they experienced, they called it MHC overshoot,
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:31.620]   myosin heavy chain, again, like fast fiber overshoot.
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.980]   So they had something like 70 more percent fibers after that.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.980]   - Wild.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:38.660]   Nobody takes two, three months off these days.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.580]   - But they figured out, Verkhoshanskyi figured out,
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.340]   that is not needed for athletes,
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:47.260]   because obviously you get deconditioned in other ways.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.620]   So remember, we're talking about heterochronicity.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.980]   Different processes take place at different rates.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.380]   So it's like you're constantly playing whack-the-mole.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.780]   So this is getting out of shape,
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.500]   but this is not recovered yet.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.340]   It's a game.
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.020]   That's a game of training programming.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.980]   So in the American system,
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:05.660]   first of all, the infrequent training,
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.540]   it reduced the stimulus for the conversion
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.140]   of the fibers towards the slower isoforms, slower types.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.700]   And the second, all the taper that they did later.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.380]   So suddenly switching from five-suit,
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.340]   like one triple, one double for a few weeks.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.220]   If you do that for just a few weeks,
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.420]   you do like a one triple, one double,
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.700]   you're not gonna lose much muscle mass,
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.180]   because it really takes over a month.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:32.420]   But there's enough time for the myosin
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.100]   to reconfigure itself to a faster type.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.140]   So that's probably what happens.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:36.980]   - Interesting.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.660]   - And neurologically, I think what happens probably,
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.340]   they exerted themselves very strongly once,
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.420]   once, twice a month.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.220]   So it's again in neural drive,
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.820]   probably with strength and disinhibition
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.500]   and other things like that.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:53.500]   And the irony is the system has lost its popularity.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.340]   Some records in the deadlift,
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.660]   like Dan Austin's record and possibly Naba's,
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.420]   set back in the '90s and '80s.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.100]   Oh yeah, Lamar Gant.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.220]   Lamar Gant, this is the strongest deadlifter
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.460]   pound per pound in history.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:13.180]   So like 683 at buck 32 or something like that.
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:15.700]   And it was done back in the '80s.
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.100]   So he trained that way.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:17.940]   Dan Austin.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.860]   In other lifts, records have increased in part
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.820]   because of the equipment changes and some other reasons.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:28.820]   But Ed Cohn dominated the platform for decades.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.580]   So there are some great, great lifters who train this way,
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.380]   but then the system lost its popularity
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.900]   for reasons have nothing to do with its effectiveness.
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.020]   It doesn't mean it's appropriate for everybody though,
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.340]   because training a lift once a week for one or two sets,
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:44.060]   there's not much practice.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:44.980]   And that's a problem.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.660]   So unless you're training under a very high level coach
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.340]   or you're already coming in with great skills,
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.380]   it's really good.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:53.060]   Second, if you need any kind of a level of endurance
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.980]   or if you're playing other sport,
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.100]   you're gonna be very sore from this type of training.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:01.140]   So it's a great system for certain type of people.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.500]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.140]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.620]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.140]   that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.300]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.460]   and potassium all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:16.780]   Proper hydration is critical
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.900]   for optimal brain and body function.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.540]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.220]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:25.460]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.180]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:30.700]   are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body,
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:32.940]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.340]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.820]   makes it extremely easy to ensure
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.660]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.260]   and adequate electrolytes.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.420]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.020]   and electrolytes, I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.060]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.060]   when I wake up in the morning.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.580]   And I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.300]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.980]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.100]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.940]   and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:20:59.780]   They have a bunch of different
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.620]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.700]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:04.960]   Frankly, I love them all.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.260]   And now that we're in the winter months
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.700]   in the Northern Hemisphere,
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.660]   Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.000]   I really like the chocolate flavors,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.900]   especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.260]   So you put it in hot water,
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:18.120]   and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate,
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.460]   especially when it's cold and dry outside,
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.520]   when hydration is especially critical.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.860]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.940]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman

[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.140]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.460]   Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.980]   on this podcast, it is the incredible impact
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.040]   that light can have on our biology.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.280]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.560]   red light and near infrared light sources
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.440]   have been shown to have positive effects
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.160]   on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health,
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.080]   including faster muscle recovery,
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.240]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.440]   improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation,
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.700]   even mitochondrial function, and improving vision itself.
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.020]   What sets Juve lights apart
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:11.600]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.640]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.880]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.080]   and near infrared light in combination
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.880]   to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.040]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.600]   about three to four times a week,
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.440]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.200]   both at home and when I travel.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.280]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.120]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.

[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.760]   Again, that's juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.400]   to get up to $400 off.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.680]   - Based on what you just told us about Franco's training
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:53.960]   and the rest, seems that shorter training cycles
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.080]   might be advantageous,
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.200]   even just conceptually and practically.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.400]   Like I've tended to break up my year
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.880]   into 12 to 16 week training cycles.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.120]   I've been doing that for a long time.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.280]   And now that I'm 49, this is the year that I decided
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.120]   I was going to start modifying my training a bit
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.720]   because certain little things aren't working for me as well.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.560]   You might laugh.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.480]   I'm actually curious whether or not you'll laugh
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:17.040]   or approve, I switched at some point
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:20.760]   to using the belt squat, these belt squat platforms.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.600]   I just feel like-
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.480]   - You may want to explain that.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.720]   - Yeah, the belt squat is essentially
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.820]   you stand on a platform.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.420]   So you're on, unfortunately you're on display
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.100]   for everybody there, but that's not why I do it.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.440]   You step up onto a platform.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.720]   Sometimes it's called a pitch shark.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.760]   Rogue makes a belt squat.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.360]   There are other ones, of course,
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.840]   have no relation to any of those companies.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.980]   And you wear a big, thick lifting belt,
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.880]   but it's kind of sagging in the front.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.960]   And then you, as if you were going to attach a weight to it,
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.080]   but you attach yourself to,
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.440]   usually it's a cable or a lever between your legs.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.360]   Sounds scary, but that lever or cable
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.320]   can drop below the level of the platform you're standing on.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.400]   And you can load up quite a bit of weight on this.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.400]   What I love about it is you can get very vertical
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.800]   if you want, or just a little bit of forward tilt
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.740]   'cause you can place your fingers on the handles.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.240]   You can grip them if you like.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.240]   The point being, there's a lot of degrees of freedom
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.320]   in terms of stance.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.520]   And I like that you're not loading the shoulders.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.480]   - True.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.400]   - I don't want to sound like a wuss, but I'll do it.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.280]   I moved from standard squats, back squats to front squats,
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.360]   then to hack squats.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.200]   And then now I've been playing around a lot
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.240]   with the belt squat and really enjoying it
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.760]   'cause you can go really deep,
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.420]   can blast out of the bottom position.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.840]   You can load up lots of plates on there
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.920]   if you have the strength to do so
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.940]   without the feeling that you're just compressing
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:34.680]   your whole spine or worrying about dropping the weight.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.280]   So I'm enjoying working with it.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.760]   I love your thoughts on belt squats.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.080]   - True.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.100]   - But in general, I am hearing you
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.400]   and I'm thinking that moving away
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.420]   from this 12 to 16 week cycles is going to be advantageous
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.320]   because what I'm finding is that
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.560]   it's hard to account for life events in that way
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.360]   and plan training and travel and all this,
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.160]   but four weeks is kind of a manageable thing.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.880]   This month, this is what I'm gonna do.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.440]   And of course the months work together.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   The body doesn't know the difference
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.080]   between February and March, as it were.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.160]   - Well, in California, it doesn't.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.200]   - It does, right, it does, right, exactly.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.160]   The seasonal cycles are real elsewhere.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.980]   But I'm thinking shorter training cycles
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.720]   might be a strong conceptual and practical framework.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.940]   And yeah, I'd love your thoughts on both of those,
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:22.100]   the belt squat or leg work that's non-spine compressing
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.700]   and shorter training cycles as a general theme
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.140]   that people might think of incorporating
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.380]   into their training.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.680]   - The belt squat and this leg work
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.160]   that's not spine compressing,
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.420]   I'm going to address healthy people like yourself.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.060]   So if somebody has medical restrictions,
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.260]   you gotta do belt squat because the doctor says so,
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.700]   that's what you gotta do.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:43.060]   As long as you're also addressing
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:44.580]   the rest of your posterior chain,
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.300]   as long as you're training your lower back,
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.780]   your upper back, obviously your neck,
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.460]   which obviously you're doing that,
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.860]   and in some other manner,
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.420]   there's absolutely no problem with that.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.940]   So let's say you're doing some shrug pulls or something,
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.100]   you got that taken care of,
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.740]   or you're doing some deadlifts.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.740]   And also for power lifters,
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.820]   what power lifters do, it's a tactic,
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.180]   is when you're training the same lift,
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.660]   especially if you train the same lift very frequently,
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.460]   there is always that heterochronicity,
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.900]   something is not catching up quite as fast.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.860]   So you're going deadlifting and your hands are beat up,
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.260]   use straps, or you come and do the deadlifting
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.780]   and your back feels like, well, it's time to deadlift,
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.460]   my back is not quite ready.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:31.220]   Well, you could go do a narrow sumo or something like that.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.340]   So there are ways of modifying things this way.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:37.380]   So you're able to, if let's say you hit some hard deadlifts
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.340]   or hard squats and you need some additional leg work,
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.180]   sure, you don't need any extra stimulation
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.820]   for your upper back and mid back.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.820]   However, if you are a person who has more of a minimalist
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:53.020]   who does fewer exercises, then you just can't afford that,
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.220]   because then you're gonna have to do
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.660]   some additional exercises.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.140]   You're gonna do something else.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.100]   So may I suggest for your listeners and viewers
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:03.900]   to do Zurcher squats, again, a fantastic exercise.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.460]   It does not beat up your shoulders.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.100]   It does not build up your elbows or your wrists.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.140]   It may leave some bruises, you know,
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.260]   but it's okay, you can live with that.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.580]   And does that answer for the bell squat?
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.420]   - Yeah.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.780]   - And by the way, machines in general,
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.420]   here's also a very interesting observation about machines.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:26.960]   Machines are very useful for advanced trainees
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.640]   and fairly useless for beginners.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.560]   - Oh, I love that you said that.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.280]   I barely touched machines early on in my training,
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.520]   dare I say, call it a career,
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.000]   but I've been doing it for more than 30 years,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.240]   so I'll call it a stage run.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.080]   - It's a good run.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.840]   - Yeah, it's a decent run.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.800]   - But if you imagine the scenarios, what do people do?
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.640]   What do people do?
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.760]   Oh, it's safer, get in,
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.480]   climb into this machine right there.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.320]   You're not developing any stabilizers,
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.000]   so you get out of this machine, you get crushed somewhere.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.720]   But on the other hand, if you're a more advanced lifter,
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.560]   so like, you know, Marty Gallagher,
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.600]   one of the top powerlifting coaches in the world,
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.920]   he might recommend leg presses
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.860]   in a very specific deadlift stance to a lifter.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:12.400]   And this is going to increase strength on your leg drive
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.640]   without beating up your back,
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.800]   but you're already doing your deadlifts,
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.400]   you can definitely do that.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   So advanced lifters may make a good use of machines
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.360]   and they don't need to be taught how to do that,
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.840]   they can figure it out.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.520]   But beginners really should just use exclusively free weights.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.960]   I'm not saying everybody should do squat, bench, deadlift,
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.720]   kettlebell snatch, and this and that, no.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.920]   There's a large menu of exercise to choose from,
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.600]   but you gotta choose just from that menu
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.400]   where you discover the weight that's free,
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.680]   that's truly, truly free.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.360]   Should we move on to the cycle, shorter cycle?
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.120]   - Yeah, the shorter cycle.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.240]   - A lot of it depends on the type of programming
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.080]   that you do.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.120]   So the type of progression that you use.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.160]   So if I may, may I step to the side on that?
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.600]   So in strength training,
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.060]   you can look at the typical linear progression,
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.160]   we just progressively increase the weight.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.000]   It only works for beginners, obviously.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.480]   You look at the wave progression,
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.320]   where you're going up for a while,
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.880]   then backing off, and then going up again.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.060]   And interestingly enough, in this classic American cycle,
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:20.960]   there's a wave there.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.520]   Even though the weights keep going up every week,
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.080]   but if you did a set of five with 500 pounds
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.000]   on the fourth week of your fives,
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.280]   and then you went to 520 for triple,
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.400]   520 for triple is a lot easier.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.920]   So there is a deload built in there,
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.160]   just people don't realize it.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.680]   So it is a form of wave loading as well.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.800]   Then there's also the step loading.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.520]   Step loading is a very interesting way of going about it,
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.580]   and I believe it's the preferred programming choice
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.360]   for do-it-yourself people,
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.800]   who not necessarily aspire to records,
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.700]   but want to train in a very simple manner.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:05.000]   And step loading pretty much means where you start out,
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.020]   it's kind of like reverse,
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.560]   think of George Costanza approach
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:11.200]   to progressive overload, right?
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.520]   So it's like regressive overload, do the opposite.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.280]   Instead of starting light and going heavier,
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:20.240]   start fairly heavy, and then stay with it,
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.880]   and then stay with it, and stay with that
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.160]   until it becomes fairly light, and then increase.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.800]   In that case, you're staying this longer.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.840]   So that's a good approach for less experienced people.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.920]   There are limitations, advanced athletes
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.480]   run into limitations of this method.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.940]   And finally, there is a variable overload,
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:40.720]   which is what's used in the Soviet weightlifting system,
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.600]   and later in Russian powerlifting,
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.840]   and there's no progression there at all.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.840]   It is just based on pure aperiodicity, irregularity.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.640]   So it's like, imagine muscle confusion,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.640]   but the smart kind, and nervous system confusion,
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.360]   where it lows whiplash, like at least 20% every time
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.400]   in volume from session to session, or week to week,
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.140]   and exercise are changing and so on,
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:05.100]   so there's no progression whatsoever.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:08.400]   So if you're using a fairly conventional
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.560]   linear or wave progression,
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.680]   the shortest cycle is generally a good idea,
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.520]   at least for older lifters.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.800]   Like in using the American powerlifting experience,
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.280]   older lifters, looking back at Ernie France,
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.360]   Rickie Crane, Rickie Crane especially,
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360]   who passed recently, unfortunately.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.720]   So they were observing how an older lifter
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.360]   can't afford to start as light,
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.060]   because he doesn't stop losing ground too much,
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.440]   and he can't afford to go as heavy as well,
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.800]   or not for long.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.880]   So they pretty much switched to shorter cycles,
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.600]   something like eight-week cycles,
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.740]   even possibly six-week cycles.
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:51.400]   So it's a legit approach.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.500]   But there are many different ways, obviously,
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.320]   because you're looking at the big picture.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.760]   You kind of have to look at it from up close,
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:00.840]   and from afar, but overall, I'd say yes.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.160]   If for older and more experienced lifters,
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.000]   it's a good idea.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:05.840]   - Great.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:10.840]   Most people, I think, who do resistance training these days
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.120]   would like to also have
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.060]   some degree of cardiovascular fitness.
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.440]   In fact, I think one of the great things
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.200]   that's happened in the last five to 10 years
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.500]   is that most everybody, men, women,
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.900]   we can talk about kids and kid training,
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:25.440]   but adult men and women are thinking about muscle,
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.000]   the importance of having muscle,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.040]   and being strong in particular,
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.640]   as part of their longevity and health.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.880]   I think this is a great progression
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.820]   that's so very different than when I was growing up,
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.200]   where the only people, at least in American gyms,
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.460]   that lifted were pre-season football players,
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:43.740]   bodybuilders, and maybe a few other niche groups.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:45.540]   But now, things have really changed.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:48.040]   Earlier, we were talking about
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:55.180]   why the Soviet system and training for strength
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.020]   has been the tradition,
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.700]   and here, why things are just so different
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.820]   in how we conceptualize resistance training.
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:04.500]   I'll just go out on a limb and say what I believe
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.240]   and have thought for a long time,
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.180]   which is that what screwed up everything,
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:09.740]   in terms of people's conceptualization
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:12.780]   about how to use resistance, is bodybuilding.
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.380]   I mean, no knock against people
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:16.220]   that wanna make bigger muscles, but-
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.740]   - That was a screw-up, number one.
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.740]   - Yeah, it seems to be that the idea is,
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.620]   you go to the gym multiple times per week,
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.580]   you get a pump, I mean, this notion of the pump,
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:26.960]   like, it always feels aversive to me.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.100]   Not the pump itself, but when people talk about it,
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:30.780]   it just feels a little inappropriate.
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.860]   Like, let's get a pump.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:33.820]   Like, it just feels weird when people say that.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.700]   In any event, but this whole notion
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.820]   of just flushing the muscle with blood
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:42.820]   and getting it to, sure, you get some window
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.340]   into your potential future self if you go home
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:47.220]   and eat a bunch of food and sleep,
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:51.700]   but somehow it's so unathletic in its approach.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.860]   And I have friends who've done competitive bodybuilding
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.220]   and that sort of thing, not too many,
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:58.420]   but so I have respect for the sport at some level,
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.180]   but I feel like the way it's spilled over
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:05.180]   into "gym culture" has done equal harm and good.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.940]   And what I like so much about your work
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:10.260]   is that it's really about strength as a skill,
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.640]   strength as an asset for longevity.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.220]   And I guess when I think about somebody
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:21.040]   who wants to be strong, somebody who wants to be healthy,
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.700]   I also have to ask, should people be training
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.180]   for strength and endurance,
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:26.940]   like the two opposite ends of the spectrum?
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.540]   'Cause it seems to me that would be the answer.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.380]   - Great question.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.500]   - As opposed to what most people do,
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.460]   which is, "Hey, I'm gonna go to the gym.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.380]   Maybe I'll push a sled and then I'll, oh no,
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.540]   I'll do some kettlebell swings.
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.140]   And then I'll also do some pull-ups.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.580]   And then I'm gonna take a picture
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.620]   of my tricep in the mirror."
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.320]   I mean, it just seems like,
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.900]   while it's better than doing nothing,
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:47.100]   it's clearly not making America that much healthier.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:52.340]   And I just think there's such a vast landscape
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:54.980]   of opportunity in training for strength and endurance,
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:58.140]   but they seem at such odds with one another for most people.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.780]   So maybe we could just kind of throw up
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.580]   on the whiteboard here,
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.820]   this notion of training to get strong,
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.020]   strength as a skill,
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.300]   strength as something that's valuable for longevity.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.900]   I think we touched on that a little bit earlier.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:10.100]   And then endurance,
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:12.960]   the ability to carry two suitcases to the airplane
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.500]   without coughing up a lung at the end.
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.940]   Also the ability to take a hike with your partner
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.780]   or your kids, maybe actually have a backpack on your back
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.100]   and not have to stop every 50 paces.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.860]   Just being a fit overall person,
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.220]   which one, forgive me for the duration of this question,
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.540]   but when one travels to Europe,
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.940]   I haven't spent too much time in Eastern Europe,
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:33.780]   but when you get over to Switzerland or Austria,
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:37.380]   you see people who are strong and they have endurance.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.900]   I mean, I imagine a Sherpa is strong
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.500]   with endurance as well, right?
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.500]   - By the way, Sherpas are really messed up.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.340]   Their mitochondria are truly messed up.
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.100]   This is excessive hypoxia.
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:46.940]   It's very interesting.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.660]   Their metabolism is quite severely anaerobic.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.500]   It's very weird.
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:51.340]   - Oh, weird.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.340]   - Their markers of oxidative stress is really, really high,
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:55.540]   but sorry, that's off topic.
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.940]   - No, no, we can touch on that 'cause it's interesting.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:00.020]   People who live at altitude and-
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:00.900]   - Up to a certain point.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:03.180]   Denver is good, the Himalayas is not good.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.700]   - Okay, well, yeah, I have Scandinavian relatives
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:10.380]   and you go to Denmark or Sweden or Norway
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.740]   and you just look at these people are so healthy.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.500]   Their posture is great, they're strong
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.100]   and they're not spending a lot of time in gyms.
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:18.300]   Sometimes they are.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.180]   So what's going on in terms of strength and endurance
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:25.180]   and maybe how bodybuilding and this notion of building muscle
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.380]   has perhaps caused some issues
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.500]   that we need to help people reconceptualize.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.820]   - Once again, several great questions.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:35.860]   Let's talk about bodybuilding
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.700]   and then before getting to endurance.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.420]   What you said, it's absolutely true,
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:43.820]   but I'd say that there are different types of bodybuilding.
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:48.500]   If you look at bodybuilding historically,
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:51.980]   it was guys were strong.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.580]   I've had the honor of knowing
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:56.620]   some golden age era bodybuilders
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:59.700]   like Franco Columba and Dave Draper and Clarence Bass
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:03.300]   and these guys were formidable.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.140]   They were not just pretty boys,
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.420]   they were absolutely extremely strong.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.660]   So I think something happened in the culture
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.660]   where bodybuilders stopped valuing strength,
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.180]   some bodybuilders.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.340]   There's still a number of guys out there
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:24.820]   who are following traditional methods and are strong.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:28.180]   Also, interestingly enough, the bro split,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.420]   hit once a muscle once a week, it's not necessarily bad
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:35.140]   if you again follow more of a into this
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.460]   classic American powerlifting model.
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.580]   So instead of training three times a week, you train five,
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:43.500]   in addition to your squad day, deadlift day, bench day,
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.860]   we can have shoulders day and arms day and whatever,
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:47.820]   but you go heavy.
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:53.900]   Look at Reg Park with his sets of five.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:57.980]   And if you focus, if you emphasize this medium reps,
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:02.020]   and again, Soviets eventually came to the conclusion
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:05.540]   that for strength, you should stick
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.580]   in the one to six repetition range
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:12.020]   and you shouldn't do a lot of singles and doubles.
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.180]   Threes and fours should predominate,
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:17.460]   but fours and especially fives and sixes,
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:19.660]   this is where you get both hypertrophy and strength.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.780]   That's that beautiful combination.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.540]   And fives have a great tradition
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.940]   in American powerlifting as well.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.740]   If you train with fives, you're gonna get muscle
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:28.860]   and you're going to get strength
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.900]   and you're not gonna complicate things.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:33.300]   So there are some bodybuilders out there
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:35.580]   who train in this particular manner
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.140]   and they're fantastically strong,
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.980]   just not many of them, unfortunately.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:42.500]   But I also would like to add that there's another influence
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.500]   that mess things up.
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:46.620]   I would take the bros of the '90s
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.380]   with the big bench press and the chicken legs
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:53.140]   to these guys who stand on balls and juggle oranges
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.980]   and whatever the hell they're doing.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:57.420]   I mean, this, the idea is,
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.860]   so there's the concept of neuroplasticity,
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:02.380]   which obviously you know so much more than I about,
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:04.820]   that that's always thrown around.
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.460]   Oh, you need variety.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:09.460]   And so they throw every circus trick
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.660]   at these poor clients.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.020]   And by the way, I use the word clients purposefully.
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.820]   Like at Strong First, at our school of strength,
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.380]   we have students because there's lots of clients.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.420]   But in that world, they're definitely clients.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.540]   Well, today you're going to stand on one foot
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.300]   and then you're going to pull on this cable.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.580]   And then tomorrow you're gonna kneel
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.500]   and you're gonna do this kind of thing.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:36.420]   While asymmetrical loading and symmetry
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.340]   are absolutely something that's needed
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.980]   under certain condition,
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:41.540]   you need to do it in a professional way.
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.780]   Like if you look at Gray Cook's work,
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:46.220]   Gray will tell you just get yourself symmetrical
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:50.860]   and start lifting instead of resort to this unlimited,
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:54.140]   what a colleague of mine, Mark Griffin,
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.100]   called random acts of variety.
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:40:00.260]   So I'd say that's the other, there are way too many choices.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.700]   And when there are no constraints,
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.500]   when everything's available, you go to a store,
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.460]   everything's available, you don't know what to pick
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.460]   and you can stick with that.
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:09.300]   So that's a very big problem, I would say.
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:14.100]   So I would say the less time people spend on the internet,
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.180]   unless you're looking up research papers
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:17.860]   or doing something else valuable or,
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:19.780]   fine, watching a good movie, that's all right.
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.380]   So unless you're looking up a research paper
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.500]   or watching a movie, forget about it.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:26.020]   Or your podcast or my website, that's it.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.620]   The rest of it, it's off limits.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:31.060]   But strength and endurance,
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:34.620]   endurance is a very broad term.
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.820]   And if we talk about, let's talk a little bit
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:41.460]   about training for athletes for endurance
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.660]   and let's talk maybe a little bit
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.980]   for the general population.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:45.220]   We're trying to do for health and again,
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:46.500]   for just going for a hike.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:52.540]   So the endurance of being able to do triathlon
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:55.660]   or swim a very long distance,
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.780]   the adaptations are primarily taking place
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:01.580]   in the slow fibers and you have some very specific
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:05.820]   adaptations to the capillaries and the mitochondria,
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:08.100]   so many things, but in a very specific way.
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:09.620]   And that's not going to help you,
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.220]   let's say, if you're a fighter.
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.860]   It's happened over and over where a guy
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:16.940]   who's been a marathoner, he takes up MMA
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:19.420]   and he starts getting gassed really rapidly
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:23.140]   because while he has, his slow fibers
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.340]   can keep going forever, but not at the intensity
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.900]   that's required for this particular sport.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:31.780]   So, and also we're talking about there's endurance
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.300]   that's peripheral and central.
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.780]   So you're talking about obviously your heart,
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.140]   you're talking about your lungs,
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:39.060]   you're talking about the plumbing,
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.500]   but then you're also talking about the extraction
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.220]   and use of the oxygen, which is huge
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:44.460]   and it's totally different.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.420]   It can be trained with the same methods,
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:48.620]   but adaptations are very different.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:50.260]   So then when people realize that,
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.900]   oh, let's start smoking these MMA guys
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:56.020]   and martial arts guys and BJJ guys,
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:57.020]   let's just make them puke
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.220]   and that's going to improve their endurance.
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:01.660]   And it does improve their endurance,
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.260]   but at a very high cost.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.620]   So in the service sports science,
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.380]   there's a term, the cost of adaptation
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.740]   comes from Felix Meyers, a professor,
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:13.740]   he was a cardiopathologist originally,
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:17.140]   but later again, his research and stress is amazing.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.540]   So there's the cost of adaptation.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:22.740]   And it's the same thing is pretty much
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:25.340]   as buying a car or a table.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:28.500]   You can get the same table for a lower price
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.220]   or you can pay the top dollar.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:31.660]   So you can increase your strength
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:34.100]   while at the same time blowing your back out,
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.140]   or you can increase your VO2 max
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.100]   while getting a resume in the process,
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:41.820]   or you can do it in a healthy way.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:43.620]   So one of the issues you have to look at,
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.700]   they're trying to lower the biological cost
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.180]   of the adaptation.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.820]   So in strength training, we do that by very careful
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.740]   and not training hard too often.
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.820]   So again, the American system is two weeks out of four.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.500]   The Soviet system, pretty much the same,
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.900]   although the planning is going to be different.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:04.100]   First, if we look at the cardiovascular adaptations,
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:07.660]   before we're looking into the mitochondria
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:08.700]   and into the muscle,
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:15.860]   most of the work should be done below the threshold,
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:17.460]   pretty much.
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:18.740]   So what's the threshold?
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.780]   So for runners, let's say you're running
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:23.260]   and you're able to maintain a conversation.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.820]   And when you start running too fast
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.260]   and you cannot maintain the conversation,
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:27.780]   you pass the threshold.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.540]   It's like you're going faster
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.380]   and you're breathing harder linearly.
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:34.220]   And suddenly it goes like this, like a hockey stick.
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.100]   So at that point, your body's no longer able
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:37.900]   to process all that acid
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.860]   and things are starting to get hard.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.260]   So there are certain implications.
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:45.820]   There are certain implications for your muscles, for sure.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.580]   We'll discuss that in a few minutes.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:49.740]   But for your heart,
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:52.100]   there are two things we're primarily trying to train.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.940]   One, we're trying to train the stroke volume.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:58.660]   So pretty much how much blood the heart can pump out
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:00.500]   with each contraction.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.980]   And it's a very simple thing to do.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:06.020]   You get up to like,
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:13.020]   you know, 70 to 85% of your maximal heart rate.
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:17.420]   So the heart starts stretching, literally.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:20.060]   So, kuchung, kuchung, kuchung.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.700]   So this blood is incoming and the heart starts stretching
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:24.460]   and it requires volume.
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.940]   Some Tour de France riders,
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:30.540]   they might throw the food in the back of the cycle
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.020]   and they ride all day
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.940]   because that's what they've got to do.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:36.300]   And that requires that adaptation.
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:37.700]   For people who just do it for health,
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:38.700]   you don't need to do that much.
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:41.260]   You know, 30, 40 minutes several times a week is enough.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.940]   But for a high level, you have to stretch the heart.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:47.380]   If you start redlining the heart rate,
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.340]   the heart starts twitching.
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:54.340]   So there's no time for it to fully relax and stretch.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.060]   You're no longer really increasing your stroke volume.
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.780]   And what you're doing right now,
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:02.420]   you're strengthening your ejection fraction,
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.340]   which is like the strength of the heart,
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.260]   which is needed for athletes
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.540]   whose sports require redlining the heart rate.
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:09.460]   You know, if you're a fighter,
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.660]   if you are a 400 meter runner,
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:12.900]   you absolutely need to do that.
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:15.260]   But what they found,
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.380]   it went back to German research going to decades later
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.820]   and then the Soviet research.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:24.860]   If you start redlining your heart rate
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:27.460]   before you have that volume that you put in
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.540]   and built up the stroke volume,
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:31.540]   you're just heading for pathology.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.100]   So there are arrhythmias,
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.500]   there's all sorts of different things that the aphibs,
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.380]   all sorts of things that can start happening that are bad.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:41.500]   And also your performance is not gonna be very high
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:44.380]   because again, your stroke volume is not there.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.420]   And even for athletes who do that,
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.500]   they should do it for a very short period of time.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.940]   It's just too stressful and it's just not needed.
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.500]   Typically it's a peak, it's peaking phase for some weeks
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:56.220]   before leading up to the competition.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:00.940]   So pretty much steady state, steady state exercise
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:03.660]   like riding a cycle or jogging or hiking,
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.820]   when you're still able to talk,
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:08.260]   it's the best, most efficient and healthiest way
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:10.460]   to promote that quality
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.460]   when you're increasing your heart stroke volume.
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:16.460]   If you decide to get a little more intense at some point,
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:18.700]   interval training is appropriate,
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:20.980]   but unfortunately it's completely and totally messed up
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:22.500]   and misunderstood.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.820]   It's like a catch all term,
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:25.820]   high intensity interval training.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:29.300]   And Brent Rushall, a professor out of San Diego said,
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.100]   this is nonsense, this term is a nonsense.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.460]   What does it even mean?
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:34.100]   Like what's high intensity?
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:35.220]   And also here's a question,
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.660]   what does low intensity interval training mean?
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:44.660]   Going back to taking a step to the side,
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.060]   but that's discussion will help us
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.860]   when we discuss what happens in the muscle terminology.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:51.780]   So there are different rest periods between sets.
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:57.100]   There is the ordinary rest period.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:59.780]   So which means you pretty much recover your function.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.220]   It's like you're just as strong
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.900]   or just as enduring as from the previous set.
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:09.380]   There is the supramax rest period,
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:10.820]   when if you rest extra,
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:13.620]   sometimes you get some extra performance out of it.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.900]   And there is this stress rest period
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:18.820]   when the next set is gonna be harder.
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:20.700]   Your performance may or may not be compromised,
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.380]   but it's gonna be harder.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:26.180]   So with ordinary stress or ordinary rest periods,
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:28.940]   that is called in track, it's called repeat training.
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.580]   You know, so you run a hundred meters,
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:33.340]   then you rest for, you know, whatever, 10, 15 minutes,
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.460]   as long as you need longer possibly,
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.260]   then you repeat it again.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.700]   And your performance stay this way.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:40.580]   Interval training, again, it's established,
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.900]   it just means that things are gonna get worse
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:44.140]   from set to set.
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.860]   So that's the definition of interval training.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.740]   The irony is the interval training was designed
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:53.100]   to increase the intensity of exercise
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.500]   while reducing the demands on the body.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:00.620]   So if you look at the works of work of Fox and Edwards,
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:03.900]   they're pioneers of interval training in the United States,
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.140]   they gave some great examples.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:07.740]   So let's say you're running for 30 seconds
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.420]   and you're at this speed
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.580]   and you're gonna produce this much acid
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:13.700]   and your heart rate is gonna be this high.
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:15.380]   Well, if you run for 10 seconds
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:19.260]   with short periods in between at the same speed,
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.980]   you're going to produce a lot less acid
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:23.540]   and your heart rate's not gonna climb to the stratosphere.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:26.780]   And that type of training is very, very useful.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.220]   And interval training can be used
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:30.380]   for promoting any type of adaptation.
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:33.940]   You can use it for hypertrophy.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.820]   So here is one training method
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:39.220]   I learned from my colleague, Fabio Zonin.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:41.300]   It was designed by Professor Masseroni
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:44.340]   in Italian Mystery Universe and a professor.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:46.460]   Okay, you take 80% of your one rep max,
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:49.060]   so let's say presumably eight rep max,
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:52.060]   set a five, rest for 30 seconds,
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.500]   set a five, rest for 30 seconds.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.940]   If you cannot do it anymore, you're done.
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.460]   And then you come back, maybe 10 minutes later,
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.300]   do it again.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.660]   That's the example of interval training again.
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:01.500]   - I see.
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:04.060]   - And you can structure interval training
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:05.820]   for adaptations within the muscle,
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:09.140]   of mitochondria, and you can also do that for your heart.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:10.580]   So here's how you do it for the heart.
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:13.380]   Today, there are a lot of fancy popular protocols,
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:14.460]   but all you have to do is go back
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:16.820]   to what Germans did many decades ago.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:17.820]   Here's the premise.
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.420]   Your vegetative system, your heart, your lungs,
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:23.780]   your plumbing, they have inertia.
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:26.500]   So for example, imagine yourself as a kid.
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.460]   You run really, really hard.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.340]   You know, you run for, you know, 100 meters or something,
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:34.940]   or less maybe, and everything's fine.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.940]   And then you're talking to your body and (gasps)
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.500]   suddenly you start sucking wind.
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:42.580]   So that's an example of this inertia.
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:44.700]   So if you get your heart rate up
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.940]   to about 85 to 90% one rep max,
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:51.020]   and then you suddenly switch to jogging,
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:53.020]   you don't wanna stop because that's just way too,
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.220]   way too hard for your heart
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:58.500]   without getting that venous return from muscles working.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.860]   What happens is the heart slows down,
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.260]   but there's that blood keeps on moving,
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:08.580]   and the blood literally stretches the walls of the heart.
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:09.420]   - I see.
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.700]   Sprint perhaps, 100, 200, 300, 400 meters,
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:14.700]   and then jog back?
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:16.980]   - Traditionally, it was not quite a sprint.
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:21.060]   The duration would be typical 60 to 90 seconds.
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:23.500]   The intensity is such that you get up to top off
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.820]   at 85, 90% of your heart rate max, something like that.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:31.380]   And then you jog until your heart rate goes to about 60, 70%.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.820]   So that's roughly about the same probably.
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:36.820]   And that, to look things up,
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.100]   it's like German interval training
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.140]   that was done.
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:44.780]   It is based on very definite physiological events,
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:46.460]   like this is what the heart does,
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:49.020]   this is what we're trying to do with the heart,
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:51.260]   and instead of inventing some things
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:52.660]   that are just simply trash the body
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:54.860]   for no reason whatsoever.
[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:56.380]   And part of the problem also, Andrew,
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:01.380]   is it's very easy to get misled by quick gains.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:05.420]   So, and it happens in strength world
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:06.540]   and in endurance world.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:11.500]   Let's remember the years when you and I
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.460]   and every other male listener bench pressed
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.580]   their max once a week.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:17.660]   You're strong.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:18.900]   Next week, you're stronger.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.020]   Third week, you're stronger.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.180]   Like you're doing the math like, okay,
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:24.540]   well, I should be setting the national record
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:29.020]   by Christmas and maybe be going to the world by summer.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.260]   And then at six weeks, you're done.
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:32.580]   And for experienced athletes,
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:34.660]   happens sooner, like after three weeks.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:35.860]   The same thing with endurance.
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:37.500]   When you start doing glycolytic work,
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.100]   when you start redlining your heart rate
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.460]   and increasing the abscesses,
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:42.420]   your performance jumps so quickly.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:43.420]   It's very contagious.
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:44.980]   It's like, oh, not contagious, pardon me.
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:47.020]   It's very exciting.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.740]   And you think that you're gonna keep going forever,
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:51.620]   but you really absolutely will not.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:55.180]   So for, if you want to train for,
[01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:58.100]   if you want to train your heart,
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:03.300]   a good way of doing that is steady state work.
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:07.820]   If you decide to do some sort of intermittent work,
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.460]   there are several different ways.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:15.780]   One is intermittent exercise
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.020]   that's more of a repeat in nature, not interval,
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:20.420]   which is very bizarre to people.
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:23.940]   Let's say that you go moderately hard for 10 seconds,
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.260]   you go easy for 10 seconds,
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:27.060]   and you do this for 30 to 60 minutes.
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.820]   Imagine doing that.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.780]   - That's good work.
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:32.300]   - It is good work, but you know what would be shocking to you?
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:34.220]   That you're not going to produce that much acid,
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:36.780]   you're gonna redline your heart rate.
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:39.020]   Better would be like 10 seconds of work,
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:41.500]   20 seconds of rest, that'll be all.
[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.340]   Fascinating research that Swedes did
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:45.340]   back in the '50s and '60s on that.
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:47.780]   It's amazing, if you keep the work periods short,
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:51.100]   you're able to not produce a lot of acid,
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:52.460]   but just go very, very hard.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.420]   And you're gonna be able to train your heart
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:56.660]   and your lungs in this manner too.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.820]   You can also do,
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:02.420]   and you also have peripheral adaptations
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.860]   in the muscles, mitochondria and so on,
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:07.340]   vascularity, some capillarization happening too.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.660]   But you know, it's also interesting,
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:11.380]   there's one particular type of,
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:13.380]   I hate the fact that it falls onto
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.420]   the high-intensity interval training umbrella,
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.340]   because it's not.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:19.660]   Because everything that sounds like hit,
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:22.980]   it's not good to me, because it's just made up label.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:25.340]   But there's one type of training
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:28.540]   that delivers great benefits to your
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.180]   cardiorespiratory system.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:32.660]   And at the same time, it also does that for,
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.100]   you know, for your mitochondria
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.100]   and even builds muscle in the same time.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:42.180]   In TRAC, it is called glycolytic power repeats.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.980]   And in the last 20 years,
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:49.260]   there were several good papers that were done on that.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:52.540]   Dybala, Bregmaster, I think.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:54.660]   Pardon me if I'm mispronouncing their names.
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:56.420]   But pretty much you do Wingate,
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:59.740]   like a 30 seconds of heart exercise,
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:01.900]   followed by approximately five minutes of rest,
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.500]   and you repeat it several times.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:07.660]   Here's what's unique about this type of method.
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:13.020]   It gets your heart rate up to about that 85, 90%
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.060]   or something.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:15.860]   Then you're gonna walk it off after that.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:19.780]   So you are going to get adaptations for your heart.
[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:21.780]   It's not the most effective way,
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:24.460]   but it's for healthy people,
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:26.820]   it's a healthy way and it's a very efficient way.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:28.380]   At the same time, we'll discuss later
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:30.420]   what happens in the mitochondria level.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:31.980]   But also what's interesting,
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:35.100]   you're also likely to get build some muscle as well.
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:39.220]   And typically there is the conflict,
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:40.340]   which we're getting to this point
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.380]   about like strength versus endurance.
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:45.260]   Typically there's a conflict of strength versus endurance,
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:48.020]   because, you know, if you're looking in the
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:50.500]   mTOR on one side, AMPK on the other side,
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:53.020]   things seem to be like, okay, this is pulling one way,
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.140]   this is pulling the other way.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:58.620]   But somehow this particular load,
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:03.140]   while promoting peripheral and central endurance also,
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:06.220]   endurance, at least in the fast and intermediate fibers,
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:08.140]   also does promote muscle growth.
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:09.860]   - Interesting, and what sort of exercise,
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:10.940]   this is not sprints,
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.260]   this would be kettlebell swings for instance.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:14.900]   - In the studies that were done,
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:17.700]   they use Wingate, they use cycle, they cycled.
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:21.020]   Sprinting, if you are going uphill,
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.940]   you can certainly do that.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.700]   - 'Cause this 30 seconds is hard, you're pushing.
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.140]   - You're pushing.
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:30.420]   Going on a track, it's too easy to get something messed up.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.180]   So going uphill, you can do that.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:33.500]   We do that with kettlebells.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.900]   We did this work in my first kettlebell school
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.860]   over 20 years ago, where we would do a set of,
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.620]   you take a heavy kettlebell, moderately heavy kettlebell,
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:45.660]   like, you know, for you or me to be like a 70 pounder.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:49.940]   And we would snatch it really hard for a set of 20, 25 reps.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:53.500]   And then we just jog till the heart rate comes down.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.460]   And then we take this leisurely power lifting rest.
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:58.140]   And we're gonna do it again.
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:01.780]   And it's a fantastic way to promote
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:04.340]   various aspects of fitness.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.380]   So you're gonna get in cardiorespiratory endurance,
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:08.260]   you're gonna have get peripheral adaptations,
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:09.820]   endurance in the muscle.
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:12.260]   And you're also building muscle at the same time.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:17.260]   The reasons for that, here's the theory.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:19.660]   Again, all the conversations we have
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.460]   about this is what happens in the muscle,
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:22.620]   all these are theories.
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:25.380]   We know pretty much if we do X,
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.300]   we're gonna get Z, whatever, or Y,
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:30.180]   some kind of result at this point.
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:32.140]   But we may not necessarily know for sure.
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.860]   So the following is another one of the theories,
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:36.020]   but it's another good, credible one.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:38.820]   So this is Professor Viktor Selyanov.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:42.620]   So according to him, the preconditions for muscle growth,
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:43.820]   in addition to the obvious,
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:47.180]   like food and things and hormones.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:51.420]   So when you reach a certain level of acidosis,
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.140]   only a certain level of acidosis,
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:55.580]   not necessarily very high,
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:58.660]   that those hydrogen ions will make the membrane permeable
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.100]   to the hormones, so they're gonna enter
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:02.620]   and go into the nucleus and start doing their job.
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:05.060]   So that's one of the part of the explanation.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:08.900]   Then at the same time, also the free creatine,
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:11.940]   when creatine phosphate, that hot fuel gets burnt off,
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:15.340]   that's also anabolic for one reason or another.
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:16.540]   So there are some explanations.
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:19.460]   Whether that's how it is or not, I don't know.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:24.380]   But the fact is doing a hard 30, 40 second set,
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.380]   followed by a very generous rest,
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:28.300]   we're talking about five, 10 minutes,
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:31.060]   and repeating it five times, possibly more,
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.740]   it works very, very well.
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:34.900]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:37.620]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Maui Nui Venison.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:39.900]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.600]   and delicious red meat available.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.140]   Now, I've spoken before on this podcast
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:45.460]   with several expert guests on nutrition
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:47.220]   about the fact that most of us should be getting
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:50.100]   one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.260]   every single day.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:52.540]   Now, not only does that protein
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:53.860]   provide critical building blocks
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:56.000]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.680]   but also for your overall metabolism and health.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.340]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:02.740]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:04.220]   and reduce sugar cravings.
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:05.660]   One of the key things, however,
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:07.880]   is to make sure that you get enough quality protein
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.180]   without ingesting too many calories.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:12.180]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:14.560]   quality protein per calorie ratio,
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.360]   so that getting one gram of protein per pound of body weight
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.020]   is both easy and doesn't cause you
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.020]   to ingest an excess of calories.
[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:24.180]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is extremely delicious.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.940]   They have venison steaks, ground venison,
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:27.220]   and venison bone broth.
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:28.900]   They also have a terrific venison jerky
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.460]   that's super convenient.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:32.300]   I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:33.780]   pretty much every day,
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.460]   and I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:36.340]   every once in a while,
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.620]   and I'll snack on the jerky whenever I need extra protein
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:41.260]   and I don't have time for a full meal.
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:44.100]   Right now, Maui Nui is offering Huberman podcast listeners
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:46.760]   a limited collection of my favorite cuts of venison
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:47.920]   and their products.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.060]   It's perfect for anyone looking to improve their diet
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:52.180]   with delicious high quality protein.
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:53.140]   Supplies are limited,
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:56.500]   so make sure to go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.360]   to get access to this high quality venison today.
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.500]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:05.380]   What should I do during my rest periods?
[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.220]   - All right, well, first of all,
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:08.800]   whenever your heart rate is high,
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:12.140]   the very first thing is to not to suddenly stop
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:14.420]   because you want to,
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:17.920]   there are valve, one-way valves in the veins
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.980]   that whenever you contract the muscles of the legs,
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.100]   they help to milk the blood back through to the heart,
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.740]   so basically they reduce the stress on the heart.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:27.820]   So just walk it off first, the first step,
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:29.420]   if your heart rate was high.
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:33.620]   Then the second thing is you want to do exercises,
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:35.420]   you want to do relaxation,
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:38.660]   myorelaxation, muscle relaxation exercise.
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:40.460]   What they are is if you watch boxers,
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:43.940]   how they, you know, shake off their shoulders
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:46.420]   and drop their hands and do things like that.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:49.100]   These exercises go back to the '30s,
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:50.820]   Soviets used them since the '30s
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:53.820]   and they used them with elite athletes,
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:56.460]   kids in grade schools and everybody.
[01:59:56.460 --> 02:00:00.820]   So these exercises serve several functions.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:03.520]   One is if you are doing an exercise
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:07.020]   that is strength exercise in nature,
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.580]   some of the cross bridges are stuck pretty much.
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:13.060]   And so your muscle is a fixotropic, it's like gel.
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:15.540]   So by moving your muscle in a passive manner,
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.540]   you get it unstuck.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.880]   And so you restore circulation, obviously.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:24.040]   And the other reason is, again,
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:26.460]   control of muscular tension is very, very important.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.300]   It's important to learn how to contract the muscle
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:33.300]   for strength, it's very important how to relax for speed,
[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:36.100]   for endurance, just for happy life.
[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:37.420]   You look at the best sprinters,
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:41.060]   note how relaxed their faces are when they run their jaws.
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:43.020]   Relaxed, how relaxed their necks are.
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.940]   So relaxation is something that's practiced,
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:46.660]   just like tension.
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:49.100]   So regardless of what exercise that you just did,
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:51.820]   shaking off, we call this fast and loose drills,
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.820]   shaking like passive, like turn your muscles to fat.
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:56.960]   So you wanna do this for a little bit.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.620]   Then after that, it depends how long is your rest.
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.420]   So if you're taking,
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:04.620]   and depends which exactly that you're doing.
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:07.900]   In some extreme examples, let's say that you're a sprinter.
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:09.580]   Remember we talked like doing sprint repeats
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:11.660]   with let's say 100 meters in 15 minutes.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:15.220]   You think, wow, sounds like a great, great training session.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:19.120]   Well, the problem is these guys do need these 15 minutes
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:22.060]   to get the acid out of the system
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:24.580]   and have some other functions to recover.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.360]   But after a couple of minutes,
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:28.320]   the CNS excitability goes down.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.700]   So what the Soviets figured out back in the '40s still
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.340]   is what you do then, after you walked it off,
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:38.420]   after you shook it off, you here and there,
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:41.780]   you insert some very kind of light and easy hops
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.900]   or whatever using the same muscle groups.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:45.540]   So these poor athletes really have
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:47.020]   a complicated rest protocol.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:50.020]   There's really no rest for the wicked there.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:52.460]   If you are a lifter who's taking
[02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:54.940]   very long rest periods in between,
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.920]   let's say you take those 10 minutes,
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:01.200]   then after your heart rate is down and after you shook off
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:03.260]   and after you walked it, you can just sit down,
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.660]   you can do whatever you want.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:08.140]   Do not sit a slouch because obviously,
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:11.840]   Stu McGill explained why that's not a good idea.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.400]   And speaking of slouching,
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.340]   one reason that runners get their backs jacked up
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:20.020]   after running or some endurance event
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:21.620]   is again, they go into their knees
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:24.620]   and they get into that collapsed posture
[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:28.540]   and their discs are really pliable and warm after the run
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:30.080]   and then suddenly put them into flexion
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.960]   and they get messed up.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:32.700]   So yeah, you also gotta, like you point out,
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:34.180]   to watch our posture,
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.260]   but you really gotta watch your posture during recovery
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:39.780]   because you slump between your sets of squats
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:42.520]   and then you could blow something out right there.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.360]   - Interesting.
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:44.900]   I used to think that I would,
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:47.120]   this recurring sort of lower back hip thing
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.780]   that I finally feel is under control.
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:52.300]   And I used to think that it correlated with travel
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.260]   and something about maybe not sleeping as well
[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.600]   and traveling perhaps.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.380]   But what I've noticed is even if I just sit too much
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:02.460]   after training my legs hard, I end up with this back issue.
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:04.720]   So just moving to a standing desk configuration
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:06.580]   after training legs, irrespective of travel,
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:07.460]   has really helped.
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:09.420]   And I think, I mean, nowadays,
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:11.020]   there's all this excitement about walking.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:13.900]   I don't know how much time you spend on social media,
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:16.660]   but walking is the new thing for 2024.
[02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:19.880]   People discovered walking can lower post-meal blood glucose.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:23.640]   I mean, all stuff that was intuitive, great thing to do.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:25.220]   We'll see what happens in 2025,
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:26.980]   what the new thing is. - What's the next hot thing.
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:30.220]   - And I'm a fan of walking, but in no small part,
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:33.220]   because it just feels like it loosens up everything
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:34.180]   after training.
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:36.340]   And I like to train early in the day if possible.
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:39.860]   And I noticed a dramatic reduction in kind of aches
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:41.340]   and strains as a function.
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:42.740]   - Also, the other thing you could do,
[02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:45.860]   I remember when I watched your podcast with Stu McGill,
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:50.300]   you mentioned that the upward facing dog,
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.740]   Cobra, Cobra helps you, right?
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:53.740]   Putting yourself in extension. - Ending into extension.
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:56.940]   - So for people for whom that works,
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:59.780]   you can just lie on the floor in your elbows
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:01.340]   and just read a book.
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:04.500]   So for example, at Strong First courses,
[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:07.100]   when people do exercise and then we teach them,
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.220]   so we have several authorized postures.
[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:12.420]   So you either have to sit ramrod straight,
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:15.340]   you can sit in a Lotus or a Seiza or something like that,
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:19.220]   or you can half kneel still upright,
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.820]   or you can lie on your stomach.
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:23.460]   So we do not allow this collapse posture
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:25.260]   because this is a great way to get hurt.
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:27.860]   Plus, you look like a slacker when you're a slacker.
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.260]   Mentally, you're not gonna be focused
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.900]   on whatever you're supposed to be doing.
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:34.780]   So I think that's a good idea.
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:36.260]   And to bring us back to,
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:37.300]   do you wanna talk a little bit
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.660]   about the peripheral adaptations from endurance?
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:40.500]   - Please, yeah. - Okay, and then maybe
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:45.100]   we can talk about what should people do who are not athletes.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:50.020]   So a much bigger thing than the VO2 max
[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:54.820]   is the adaptations, the ability of your muscles
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.540]   to extract and use the oxygen.
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:59.660]   So this, again, called this revolution,
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.220]   anti-glycolytic revolution,
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:03.740]   comes from also Yuri Verkhoshansky.
[02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:05.740]   Again, he's known as the father of plyometrics,
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:07.980]   but he's so much more than that.
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:10.940]   And back in 1980,
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:13.780]   he looked at the typical endurance training protocols
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.060]   and he says, okay, everything,
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:18.380]   everybody's trying to push the athlete
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.660]   to the greatest degree of discomfort
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:22.100]   and make the athlete accustomed
[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:23.540]   to that degree of discomfort.
[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:26.380]   And he says that that's just wrong.
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:30.620]   Instead, we need to figure out how to postpone the fatigue
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:33.420]   and how to fight the mechanisms that produce the fatigue.
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:35.940]   And he says, glycolysis, anaerobic glycolysis
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:37.820]   is the primary cause of that.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.140]   We could split a lot of hairs,
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:42.900]   whether it's the glycolysis itself
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:47.900]   or it's the acid coming from ATP breakdown
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:53.100]   or whether it's non-organic phosphates or whatever,
[02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:54.700]   but whatever it is, it always happens
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:56.860]   when the acid doses is running high,
[02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:58.260]   when acid becomes high.
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:03.260]   So that doesn't really matter which exact factor is.
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:08.460]   So he figured out you need to promote aerobic metabolism
[02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:10.340]   in the working muscle fibers.
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:12.180]   So he decided that endurance training
[02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:13.820]   for high-level athletes
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.180]   and people who are not athletes,
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:18.220]   it will apply to you as well, has to be specific.
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:22.300]   That's exactly why like that marathon runner
[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:26.580]   who joined the MMA class and then Sucking Wind,
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:29.260]   his endurance is totally not specific.
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:33.220]   Here's an example of specific endurances
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:37.100]   where you're using the same muscle fibers in your sport
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.900]   and in a mode that's consistent with that sport.
[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:44.900]   So Verkhoshansky would have people like skiers, for example,
[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:48.900]   do this very long push-off on the ski and then glide.
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:51.140]   Push-off and glide.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:53.940]   And yeah, Suleyanov who came after him.
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:55.020]   So an example of that,
[02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:56.940]   you have this really powerful contraction
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.420]   of the muscles that are used in your sport.
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:00.820]   And then there's that relaxation
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:05.180]   during which the muscle recovers its myoglobin oxygen,
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.420]   that there's a small amount of oxygen in the muscle.
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:09.900]   And it requires that creating a phosphate fuel
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.820]   that is used for that short-term.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:13.740]   So pretty much instead of relying
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:18.020]   on that acid-producing metabolism, glycolytic metabolism,
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:22.820]   that you start using on one hand to use Lifter's metabolism,
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:27.060]   create a phosphate, that's what fuels a set of three reps.
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:29.220]   And on the other, you're using this marathon runners,
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.780]   aerobic metabolism.
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:33.820]   So you're like putting glycolysis in a vice.
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:38.820]   And a great example of that comes from...
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:42.580]   Verkhoshansky is not the only one who came up with this idea.
[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:44.660]   It's been reinvented by others.
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.940]   So in boxing, Leon Spinks,
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:50.380]   to the viewers who don't know who he is,
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:53.740]   Leon Spinks was a professional boxing world champion.
[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:57.820]   And he defeated Muhammad Ali, amongst among others.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.380]   So he's a great champion.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:01.700]   And he hired Arthur Lyddiard,
[02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:03.900]   who was a great running coach from New Zealand,
[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:06.500]   to work on his conditioning.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:10.340]   And Lyddiard had him do work in the heavy bag
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:14.140]   for an hour and a half to two hours, nonstop.
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:16.660]   And he says, "No, of course you're not going all out.
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:17.700]   Sometimes harder,
[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:19.700]   but you're definitely not tapping the bag.
[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:21.620]   You're not shadow boxing."
[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:24.300]   And so if you're putting your muscle fibers
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:26.340]   in a very specific metabolic window
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:28.220]   and do it over and over and over,
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:31.140]   that they start adapting to it.
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.140]   Fast fibers start developing mitochondria.
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:36.740]   Fast fibers start developing capillaries.
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:39.740]   Fast fibers don't lose their strength,
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:41.660]   but they start developing the plumbing
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:44.220]   and the ability to use the oxidative system
[02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:45.500]   to recover rapidly.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:49.060]   But going back to, again, this larger prioritization idea
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:51.540]   is when you start with a new stimulus,
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:53.820]   it's your body's highly reactive,
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:54.900]   but the resistance is low.
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:56.420]   You cannot take much of it.
[02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:58.660]   Then that teeter-totter goes the other way.
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:00.180]   You'll no longer, so you have to figure out
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:02.340]   how to restore that reactivity.
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:04.340]   And different training systems do it differently.
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:07.820]   So an example of the American powerlifting system,
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:10.900]   you basically go lighter, start over the lightweight.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:13.140]   So you decondition yourself purposefully,
[02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:15.060]   like two steps forward, one step back.
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:18.620]   That's another example would be to use
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:22.300]   what the Soviets call specialized variety.
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.300]   And this is something that you could see
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:26.460]   in the Soviet weightlifting system with Medvedev
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:30.180]   and Alexei Medvedev, one of the scientists and coaches,
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:32.780]   and also the West Side Barbell Powerlifting Club.
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:36.980]   So specialized variety, as opposed to random variety,
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:39.700]   is when you have the same lift
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:42.020]   and with just very slight modifications.
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:45.140]   So the motor program, the intention stays the same.
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:50.140]   But again, imagine that instead of dead lifting,
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.740]   dead lifting from the platform,
[02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:55.460]   you're dead lifting standing off a plate.
[02:09:55.460 --> 02:09:57.460]   So just slightly increase the range of motion,
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:59.140]   but you're still doing the same thing.
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:03.700]   Or imagine that you bring your grip
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:06.180]   and the bench press a couple of inches in.
[02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:08.180]   Or imagine that you use a block,
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:10.900]   just as a popular exercise in powerlifting.
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:13.500]   You put a, like imagine putting a brick on your chest,
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:15.140]   something the size of a brick,
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.940]   lowering it to that, pausing and pressing back
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:20.340]   to work that very specific sticking point.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.060]   So you're still benching.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:25.180]   So what you're doing is you're resolving this conflict
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:27.820]   between accommodation and specificity.
[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:29.460]   And like, on one hand, it's novel,
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:30.500]   but on the other hand, it's really,
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:32.340]   it's like same but different.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:33.980]   It's a very good tactic.
[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.980]   It requires the knowledge of the iron game.
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:42.540]   It's not some, because if you go from the bench press
[02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:44.700]   to the military press or dips,
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:47.580]   you might see improvement, but, or might not,
[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:50.060]   because that's not specialized variety anymore.
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:53.500]   But if you look at, like in Medvedev,
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:57.060]   Alexei Medvedev, when he coached the national team,
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:59.140]   for these clean and jerk and snatch,
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:02.260]   for the two competitive lifts,
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:04.460]   they had 100 variations.
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:05.540]   - Wow.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:07.900]   - But all these variations were like, okay,
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:09.940]   so now we're snatching from a hang.
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:11.740]   Now we're snatching from blocks.
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.300]   Now we're jerking from the rack.
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:14.140]   Do you see what I mean?
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:15.820]   They're all, this reminds me of,
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:20.180]   this reminds me of this humorous book about Scandinavians,
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:21.940]   written by a Scandinavian,
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.100]   explaining how very different different Scandinavians are.
[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:28.020]   And so this book has pictures of the same guy
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:29.180]   wearing different sweater.
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:30.020]   - Sounds about right.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:30.860]   - So yeah, that's-
[02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:33.260]   - My Scandinavian relatives will chuckle at that.
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:35.980]   I feel like one of the, again,
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:40.500]   I'm not trying to point out the ills of the fitness culture,
[02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:43.260]   but I feel like if I were to put up on a wall,
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:45.940]   the two or three things that have caused the most confusion
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:50.180]   and reduction in people's potential results from fitness
[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:52.940]   would be seeking the pump as its own thing
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:55.100]   and seeking soreness as its own thing,
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:56.700]   and then confusing panting hard
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:59.020]   and sweating a lot with intensity.
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.020]   I feel like those three things,
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:02.420]   people think I had a great workout,
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.980]   or my new trainer is,
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:06.540]   I finished just completely depleted.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:07.780]   And then these are the same people
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:09.100]   that are complaining about an injury,
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.660]   or they quit, or they don't have the motivation
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.940]   because they're not taking whatever pre-workout is required
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:19.140]   to generate that kind of "intensity."
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:21.860]   I'm not looking for agreement,
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:23.220]   but would you agree or disagree?
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:25.620]   I mean, and then maybe by comparison,
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.300]   we could sort of throw up on the wall
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.980]   the things that we should be seeking when we train,
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:31.660]   as opposed to these kind of--
[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:33.260]   - You know, before I answer this question,
[02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:35.500]   since we're talking about the peripheral adaptations,
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:37.260]   you made a great point about seeking pump.
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:38.580]   I'm gonna give you a great example
[02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:40.580]   how when not seeking pump is gonna do,
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:43.260]   so can I deliver a great adaptation for you?
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:46.940]   So do you remember that idea of punching the bag
[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:48.420]   for an hour, let's say, or two hours?
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:50.460]   That's how that promotes mitochondrial
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:52.700]   and endurance development in the fast-switch fibers.
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:55.900]   That can also be done with strength exercises as well
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:57.860]   for wrestlers and MMA fighters.
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:59.020]   So you can do the bench press,
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:02.140]   you can do bench press and develop endurance
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:04.420]   in your fast-switch fibers.
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:06.940]   The nature of endurance is very peculiar.
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:09.260]   You know, in team sports,
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:11.460]   there's a term "repeat sprintability."
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:13.460]   So repeat sprintability means that,
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.540]   let's say that you sprint for 20 meters,
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:16.740]   rest for less than a minute,
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:19.020]   sprint for another 20, you know, just something like that.
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:20.700]   So sprint rest, sprint rest,
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:24.420]   which reflects the nature of team sport,
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:25.940]   football, soccer, and so on.
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:28.660]   It's totally different from running 400 meters
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:30.140]   around the track.
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:33.180]   In strength, endurance is the same thing.
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:36.740]   NFL combined, you know, it's a fine test, whatever.
[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:39.340]   It's a nice bodybuilding exercise, good pump.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:43.540]   But on the field, you're not doing 30 reps.
[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:45.340]   You're doing one rep, and then a little bit later,
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:46.940]   you're gonna do another rep.
[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:51.420]   So your conditioning for fast-switch fibers
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:53.260]   can be structured in the same manner.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:55.900]   So there's Russian research,
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:57.500]   a researcher named Bovikin,
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:01.420]   he put his several groups of athletes
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:02.900]   in different protocols.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:06.060]   So one of them was doing the typical high-intensity,
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:08.220]   whatever, circuit training, smoker, right?
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:10.420]   So you take 70% of your one-rep max,
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:11.820]   and you do this for 30 seconds,
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.020]   and you go push hard, and then you do the next one,
[02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:15.380]   and very typical.
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:19.420]   Then the other group, anti-glycolytic group,
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:22.780]   these athletes would lift the same 70% one-rep max
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:23.820]   for three reps.
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:28.100]   They do one exercise, second exercise, third exercise,
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:30.460]   rest for one minute, do it again, and again, and again.
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:33.180]   So to the listeners, 70-rep max,
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:35.420]   an average athlete can probably crank out
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:37.020]   about 12 reps with it.
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:39.780]   A fighter is probably gonna crank out 20-some reps
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:42.860]   with that easily, so they only do three reps.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:47.740]   And so three reps, another exercise, another exercise,
[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:50.540]   rest for one minute, do it over and over and over.
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:55.300]   And the end result was really fascinating, the outcome.
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:59.700]   There is one particular test discovered
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:03.340]   by the same researcher that correlated,
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:05.900]   has the highest correlation in competitive performance
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:07.580]   for MMA fighters.
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:13.340]   So this test was R0.888, it's very, very high.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:15.340]   And very interesting thing, what it is,
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:18.740]   it's the rate of heart rate recovery
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:23.740]   after an all-out set with 70% one-rep max deadlift.
[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:26.780]   It's hard set, it's brutal, very, very brutal.
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:30.420]   Interestingly enough, the reps with 70% one-rep max
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:32.380]   correlation was not so good.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:34.380]   Even the deadlift strength was not so high.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:39.060]   But it's that recovery from that was very, very high.
[02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:42.780]   So the group that did this anti-glycolytic work,
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:43.980]   never did more than three reps,
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:46.500]   completely blew the traditional training group
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:47.740]   out of the water.
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:50.380]   Then in addition to that, they were able to bang out
[02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:52.220]   a lot more consecutive reps as well.
[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:54.020]   They weren't even in training for that.
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:56.260]   Then after that, they also saw competitive,
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:59.180]   better results in competition and so on and so forth.
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:05.860]   It's a great way to train because you're able to,
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:09.740]   so you take, imagine taking a weight that you can lift
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:13.220]   maybe 12 to 20 times.
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:15.340]   And you lift it about three times.
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:18.220]   Rest for a minute and do it again and again and again.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:22.740]   This is very much like a blue collar worker's day.
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:24.940]   And you're not seeking pump whatsoever.
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:28.740]   But as a result, you're going to develop that type
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.500]   of endurance that repeats strength endurance
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:35.300]   that very much is applicable to most combat and team sports.
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:36.540]   And also for the real life.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:40.580]   Whenever you are moving furniture,
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:42.700]   you're not trying to look, I'm gonna try to get a pump.
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:45.340]   Let's see, get this piano up there and I'll get another one.
[02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:47.020]   Then we're going to rest for 20 minutes.
[02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:48.300]   Then we're going to start over.
[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:53.300]   No, Swedish work on occupational strength,
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:56.740]   they found that old and crafty and wily workers
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:59.460]   like loggers and others, they were able to like,
[02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:02.420]   they keep their efforts very brief.
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:03.780]   And then they rest for a few seconds
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.740]   and do it over and over and over.
[02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:10.740]   So that intermittent nature of rest is very powerful.
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:12.860]   - It seems like this is a repeating theme.
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:14.380]   And by the way, thank you for spelling that out.
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:16.620]   So for people that perhaps want to try something like this,
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:18.860]   and I intend to, four exercises.
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:19.700]   - Three.
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:21.580]   - Three exercises, excuse me.
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:26.100]   Done each at roughly 70% of your one repetition maximum.
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:27.940]   So what you could do for about 12 repetitions,
[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.600]   but you're only doing three repetitions.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:31.220]   Rest a minute in between exercises.
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:32.180]   - And the rest active again.
[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:35.140]   Just walk around, shake it off and do this four,
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:37.820]   do this about 15 times, possibly later.
[02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:39.020]   - 15 rounds.
[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:40.020]   - Up to 15 rounds.
[02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:45.020]   And so this could be Zurcher squat, pull up,
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:50.340]   dip, deadlift or something like that.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:51.180]   Maybe going deadlift and then Zurcher squat.
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:52.460]   - Yeah, I probably would not do the deadlift.
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:54.300]   You know, you used really good examples.
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:58.020]   So this is a protocol that I did for a couple of friends
[02:17:58.020 --> 02:18:00.540]   of mine for their high-level BGJ competition.
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:01.460]   We did exactly that.
[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:04.780]   They did Zurchers, they did pull-ups on towels,
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.020]   and you know, more specific and more grip.
[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:09.480]   And they did the closed grip bench press.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:10.420]   And the reason it's closed,
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:12.180]   it doesn't put on quite as much mass,
[02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:14.740]   but it, you know, works at triceps really quite nicely.
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:17.500]   But yeah, but you can even do it with one exercise.
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:18.860]   Three reps, rest for a minute,
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:21.460]   three reps, rest for a minute, and so on.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.580]   - How many times per week is one repeating that?
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:25.980]   - You can repeat this three, four times a week easily,
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:27.420]   but it depends on what else you do.
[02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:28.980]   Twice a week is enough.
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.300]   Even twice a week is enough.
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:32.700]   And it fits your strength training regimen.
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:34.700]   It doesn't take away from your strength day.
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:37.000]   So it pretty much, you can treat that as your light day
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.540]   for your strength for the same lifts.
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:40.620]   - Okay, so, and this would,
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:43.420]   is going to increase endurance,
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:46.940]   but is also going to increase strength somewhat.
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:48.900]   - It's going to increase strength somewhat.
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:51.780]   In Bovikin's experiments, it definitely did,
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:52.700]   at least on fighters.
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:54.920]   But realize fighters typically are not that strong.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:56.860]   So up to a point, up to a point,
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:58.580]   it is going to increase your strength as well.
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:01.420]   And at the very least, it's going to support your strength.
[02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:04.900]   And it's a great way to just perfect your technique,
[02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:05.900]   perfect your skill.
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:06.740]   It's wonderful.
[02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:08.700]   It's very, very meditative.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:10.900]   My colleague at Strong First, Brad Jones,
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:14.540]   he even just wrote a book about it,
[02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:17.880]   Iron Cardio, because he took a protocol,
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:20.260]   strength aerobics protocol, like this Russian protocol
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:21.820]   developed by another one of my colleagues,
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:24.420]   Alexey Sinat, another one of our instructors.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:26.780]   And he just used the whole system and people loving it
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:29.500]   because, sorry, I'm going to go back
[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:31.500]   from the beginning to Alexey Sinat.
[02:19:31.500 --> 02:19:34.300]   So he lives in France.
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:36.380]   And he was coaching some-- he was
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:42.600]   coaching some law enforcement, some law enforcement personnel.
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:45.220]   And they were on a stakeout where they absolutely
[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:47.900]   had no ability to train normally.
[02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:50.700]   And they wanted to do something, something effective.
[02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:53.060]   So he said, OK, take this kettlebell
[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:54.540]   and you keep it in your hotel room
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.460]   or wherever is your stakeout.
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:20:00.460]   Do one clean, one press, one front squat.
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:01.780]   Put the kettlebell down.
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:02.740]   Shake it up.
[02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:05.300]   One clean, one press, one squat.
[02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:06.380]   Put it down.
[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:08.660]   And like a metronome, in a very rhythmical manner,
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:10.980]   you're not trying to breathe hard.
[02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:12.860]   You're not trying to get a pump with singles.
[02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:14.020]   You won't.
[02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:17.200]   And you do this for-- you do this for about 30 minutes
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:20.460]   or whatever amount of time that you do.
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:23.500]   And it does develop that repeat strength endurance
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:25.060]   fantastically well.
[02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:27.440]   There is additional secondary effect of some cardio
[02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.940]   because you're breathing in between pretty much.
[02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:30.660]   You're recovering.
[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:32.140]   Your heart is recovering.
[02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:35.220]   And you're not getting sore because you
[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:38.100]   talked earlier about people seeking pump and seeking
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:39.500]   soreness.
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:41.540]   One of the reasons soreness comes from
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:43.860]   is obviously a lot of eccentric contraction.
[02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:45.100]   That's very true.
[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:47.500]   But what people don't realize is that soreness also
[02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:49.780]   comes from too much acid.
[02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:53.420]   In the past, the coaches used to tell, oh, acid
[02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:54.840]   burns holes in your muscle.
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:56.140]   It doesn't.
[02:20:56.140 --> 02:20:58.660]   But what it does do is when the acid levels are
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:00.700]   high in the muscle, it stimulates
[02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:03.260]   production of free radicals, which pound the cellular
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:04.540]   membranes later.
[02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:08.280]   It also stimulates activity of lysosomes and phagocytes
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:11.660]   that just eat up, eat up the muscle.
[02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:13.180]   So if you do too much--
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:15.180]   if you do too much acidic work, you're
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:16.740]   going to be sore as well.
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:20.420]   So seeking that makes no sense whatsoever, especially
[02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:23.300]   as we know, not even from scientific studies,
[02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:26.260]   but from athletic experience, some people
[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:28.740]   get sore all the time, see no progress in anything.
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:29.900]   Some people don't get sore.
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:32.660]   They keep getting stronger and everybody in between.
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:34.820]   So there is no correlation.
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:37.740]   If you're looking for pump, on the other hand,
[02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.900]   if you're trying to build muscle,
[02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:43.820]   one very well-building strength, one very simple guideline
[02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:48.940]   would be achieve some pump with a heavy weight and low reps.
[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:52.980]   So if you keep your reps to five and fewer, even three,
[02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:55.020]   but you achieve a little pump, that
[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:57.740]   means you've performed a sufficient volume of work
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:21:59.340]   to stimulate the adaptation.
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:01.660]   What exactly happens in the muscle, I cannot tell you,
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:04.060]   but it absolutely does work for both strength
[02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:08.320]   and both hypertrophy.
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:11.300]   So many theories about what causes hypertrophy.
[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:13.340]   At least you and I know that we don't know.
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:15.660]   We're just speculating here.
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:19.340]   I really appreciate that you always acknowledge that,
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:23.580]   that we're not totally in the dark about hypertrophy.
[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:27.340]   I like this theory about the hydrogen creating
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:29.740]   a permeability of the cells.
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:32.500]   And you mentioned that then it gives the hormones access.
[02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:33.460]   Some folks might know--
[02:22:33.460 --> 02:22:34.300]   - To the nucleus, yeah.
[02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:36.740]   - And some people might know that the steroid hormones
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:38.660]   like testosterone, estrogen, and others,
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:40.380]   they combine to cell surface receptors,
[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:42.780]   but they can also go into the nucleus of a cell itself
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:45.420]   and cause changes in gene expression,
[02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:47.220]   which is sort of, if you just think about puberty
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:49.100]   as the most salient example, right?
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:50.880]   There's all these latent potential
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:51.980]   in the cells of the body,
[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:55.300]   but then once the testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
[02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:56.620]   and estrogen arrives in the body,
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:59.460]   depending on the sex of the individual,
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:02.500]   then you activate hair growth, you activate breast growth,
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:04.620]   you activate muscle growth, thickening of the vocal cord.
[02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:07.480]   Anyway, that's through changes in gene expression.
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:10.820]   In this configuration that you described before,
[02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:14.300]   you know, of doing this three repetitions and repeating,
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:15.140]   you may be doing that three times a week.
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:17.260]   - Up to three, you can even do one, as you mentioned, yes.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:19.340]   - Right, three times a week.
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:22.060]   - Could I also train for strength simultaneously?
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:22.900]   - Absolutely, you can.
[02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:24.300]   - Same days or other days?
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:25.140]   - Other days.
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.780]   - Other days, so on the intervening days,
[02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:29.700]   I could go in and do my real strength work.
[02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:31.620]   - Yes, and you look at your priority.
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:34.060]   If your strength is more important,
[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:37.200]   do this type of a strength aerobic work
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:39.180]   no more than twice a week.
[02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:41.500]   And, you know, then you do strength
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:43.860]   like an additional three times or four times.
[02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:46.840]   If that type of endurance is more important,
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:48.660]   do real strength work once a week,
[02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:50.860]   and then three, four times of the other kind.
[02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:55.300]   This is also a very good idea in general for planning,
[02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:58.660]   for training different qualities.
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:01.220]   Because trying to develop everything to a high level
[02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:02.980]   at the same time, it's impossible.
[02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:05.700]   Simultaneously training in parallel everything
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:08.300]   only is good for young kids when they're developing
[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:10.540]   because, you know, you gotta try everything.
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:12.100]   Nothing's at a high level.
[02:24:12.100 --> 02:24:14.220]   Later on, there are different models
[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:18.280]   of how to structure addressing different qualities.
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:20.940]   So one example would be block training.
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:22.420]   So here's one really good example
[02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:27.420]   how strength and hypertrophy can be addressed,
[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:29.780]   can be addressed at different periods.
[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:31.960]   The experiment goes back to 1970s.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:34.700]   It was done on Ivanov, Kiseleva,
[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:36.840]   I forgot the third author.
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.420]   Experiment done on throwers.
[02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:43.660]   And they were doing squats and bench presses.
[02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:48.660]   And one group was doing 85% for five triples,
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:50.840]   you know, typical heavy type stuff.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:53.480]   The other was three sets of 10 with 60%,
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.480]   which is fairly typical hypertrophy work.
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:59.000]   Jim Brose would say that's too light for six sets of 10.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.480]   And I say, "No, it's not."
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:03.000]   Because you still have to throw the shot for the next day.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.520]   If you do 10 sets of 10 reps to failure,
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:08.080]   you're going to be completely done.
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:10.280]   Your strength will be down by about 40%
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:11.960]   for the next few days.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:14.900]   So, and so the one group did this,
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:16.240]   the other group did this.
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:17.720]   They both made good gains.
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:20.640]   And the third group, but up to a point,
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:21.600]   then they plateaued.
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:22.880]   The third group, they alternated
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.960]   two weeks of this, two weeks of that.
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:27.320]   And they, in the squat, interestingly,
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:28.960]   I have to say it didn't make that much difference,
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:30.960]   but in the bench press, there was a huge difference
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:33.420]   that alternating these two types stimuli.
[02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:35.000]   So that's an example of block training,
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.320]   how you can do that.
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:37.680]   But what you can also do
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:40.940]   is you could simply maintain a quality.
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:43.280]   So fortunately, it takes a lot less work
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.120]   to maintain anything that you've reached
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:48.720]   than to get there.
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:51.920]   So typically, training some quality once a week
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:54.200]   at a moderate effort is enough to maintain it.
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:56.240]   Like in strength, example of strength,
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:58.440]   if once a week you lift 80% of your max
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:00.320]   for three sets of three reps,
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.980]   you can maintain your strength easily for months.
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:05.440]   Easily, it just doesn't take much at all.
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:07.560]   And you don't want to stop your strength training ever.
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:09.620]   Totally, because again, it has that,
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:12.740]   it will improve everything that you do,
[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:14.320]   even your endurance.
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:16.880]   But then you can switch the priorities in the same manner.
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.320]   And people can do that in their own way.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:22.360]   Oh, okay, here's a great example.
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:24.080]   So I love Stu's biblical week.
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:28.300]   So where Stu McGill, he trains two days a week of strength,
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:32.200]   two days a week of mobility, two days a week of endurance,
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:36.080]   which is a very good and balanced model.
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:37.760]   But what you could do for a while
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:39.820]   is you switch to doing one, two, three.
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:42.920]   So let's say one quality gets three days a week.
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:45.720]   One quality gets two, one quality gets one.
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:47.720]   And then you shift the priority.
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:50.800]   So this sort of a serial specialization
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:53.880]   is a very good tactics for experienced trainees.
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:57.400]   - Maybe switching it up once every month, perhaps?
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:59.280]   - Once a month is good, once a month is good.
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:04.160]   - And maintaining that, you know, moderate, hard,
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.640]   what was it, moderate, very hard?
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:08.600]   What was Franco's, what was the cycle?
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:09.440]   Forgive me for forgetting.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:10.840]   - You know, you can do that as well.
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:13.960]   Yeah, Franco had four weeks of deadlifts,
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:16.840]   moderate, heavy, moderate, very heavy.
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:21.200]   And again, we can define them a lot of different ways,
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:26.200]   but we definitely need to vary the effort,
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:29.660]   not just the intensity somehow in our training.
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:34.660]   It can be done differently in different training systems.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:40.620]   One very simple way is just to stop your sets earlier,
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:42.660]   before, long before failure.
[02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:44.540]   And, you know, later on in some weeks,
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.540]   just get a little bit closer to that.
[02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:49.700]   So that's an example of that classic American cycling,
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:51.220]   powerlifting cycling.
[02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:53.920]   So when on your week four,
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.660]   you're gonna do five reps with your five rep max.
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:00.140]   But on week one, you're doing five reps
[02:28:00.140 --> 02:28:02.380]   with your perhaps 10 rep max.
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:04.940]   So that's a very simple way of doing that,
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:07.900]   where you go easy and then you go harder,
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:09.180]   and then you start over.
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:10.860]   But there are many, many different other ways
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:12.340]   of structuring it.
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:14.380]   But generally speaking, I'd like to warn people
[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:18.060]   that training hard has to be done,
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:19.380]   but it's not something,
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:21.860]   it has to be done in really small doses.
[02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:25.060]   Like let's use singles as an example, heavy singles.
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:28.300]   Heavy singles are the special sauce of strength training.
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:30.840]   They cannot be used as the foundation of your training
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.260]   unless you are, except for some very few
[02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:35.880]   genetically gifted individuals.
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:37.820]   You know, we all know that Bulgarians have done that
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:40.780]   in weightlifting, but again,
[02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:45.780]   these guys were specially selected, specially assisted,
[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:48.340]   and they were broken very quickly.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:50.700]   Soviet champions, there are some Soviets
[02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:54.140]   who won the Olympics at the age of 36,
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:56.920]   like Plukfelder and Alexeev.
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:00.260]   For weightlifting, that's just an absolutely old man.
[02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:03.100]   And Rigert said, David Rigert said, I think what?
[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:07.000]   63 world records, because they were very careful
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.560]   about when to use this near maximal stimuli.
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:13.620]   They figured out this, and the system itself,
[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:15.700]   the Soviet weightlifting system was totally empirical,
[02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:17.200]   which is really fascinating.
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:18.760]   They just looked what works, what doesn't,
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:21.040]   compare it, and just kept trying.
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:23.160]   So they've experimented with everything.
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:26.520]   And they simply have found that certain observations,
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:31.040]   like okay, lighter lifters can do more heavy singles
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:32.480]   than heavier guys.
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.040]   Intermediates can do more than the advanced guys.
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:40.080]   It's gonna vary from lift to lift, a lifter to lifter,
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:41.920]   no difference between guys who are on drugs
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:45.060]   and guys who are not, but you have to individualize it.
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:48.340]   And they found that if you do too many heavy singles,
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:51.280]   you're going to not progress rapidly or hurt yourself.
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.820]   You don't do enough, you don't progress as quickly.
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.220]   So it has to be, you have to find
[02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:57.140]   that sweet spot for yourself.
[02:29:57.140 --> 02:29:59.400]   And they also were very definite
[02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:01.300]   that the singles are maximal.
[02:30:01.300 --> 02:30:03.700]   So that's what competitions are for.
[02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:07.860]   So they would go to 90, maybe 92 and a half percent
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:09.420]   once in a blue moon, 95,
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:12.740]   but you're not there to test yourself.
[02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:16.460]   There's even like Russian power lifters,
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:18.700]   what they do a couple of weeks before a meet.
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:23.700]   They have this workup to await,
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:25.780]   that's kind of max.
[02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:27.780]   So the word for this Prikyutka,
[02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:31.180]   and Prikyutka, it translates kind of like estimate.
[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:32.620]   It's like an estimate, this is not.
[02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:34.600]   You're guessing like, hey, see, this is where I'm at.
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.280]   That gives me an idea of what's gonna be my first attempt,
[02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:38.700]   what my opener is gonna be.
[02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:41.700]   Instead of, oh, I'm gonna test myself, I'm gonna show them.
[02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:43.740]   Gym is not the place to show anything.
[02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:45.660]   That's what the platform's for.
[02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:47.580]   So you need to find,
[02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:49.820]   if you're interested and serious about strength,
[02:30:49.820 --> 02:30:52.540]   you need to find how often you can go heavy
[02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:53.940]   in the different lifts.
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:58.940]   Start with something maybe once a month, about 90%,
[02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:01.060]   and then try to see doing it more,
[02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:03.940]   doing it fewer times.
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:06.420]   But the meat and potatoes of the training
[02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:08.800]   has to be in these moderately heavy weights.
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:14.180]   Heavy enough to respect, light enough not to fear,
[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:16.260]   and most of the work has to be done with that.
[02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:18.340]   So it's like those sets of three, four,
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:22.460]   maybe five reps with 80%, something like that.
[02:31:22.460 --> 02:31:25.460]   And that's fairly universal across the training systems
[02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:30.060]   because the American powerlifting system is organized,
[02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:32.660]   the cycling is organized totally different,
[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:35.820]   but that's, again, there's going to be fives
[02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:38.140]   and threes and fours, that's gonna be a big deal.
[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:40.700]   Soviet system, different, but a lot of threes,
[02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:43.660]   a lot of fours, some fives, some variations.
[02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:46.500]   But why it is so?
[02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:50.300]   Some of it possibly has to do with skill practice
[02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:52.980]   because this goes to an example,
[02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.660]   it's a Western study of a discreet skill.
[02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:57.420]   A discreet skill to listeners,
[02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:59.100]   that means something that happens once,
[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.060]   kind of like a throw or a lift,
[02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:03.980]   as opposed to continuous skill like running.
[02:32:03.980 --> 02:32:06.260]   And in an experiment, they tested these athletes
[02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:09.080]   to do this discreet skill for six sets of one,
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:12.260]   three sets of two, or one set of six.
[02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:14.740]   And two sets of three did much better.
[02:32:14.740 --> 02:32:17.060]   So supposedly, it's like there's certain amount
[02:32:17.060 --> 02:32:19.340]   of repetitiveness, like when you hit the perfect trap
[02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:20.740]   and then you're done.
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:24.220]   So again, triples have that very special quality.
[02:32:24.220 --> 02:32:27.020]   - And presumably, there's a drop off of ability
[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:29.180]   to concentrate and really execute properly.
[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:30.020]   - Absolutely.
[02:32:30.020 --> 02:32:32.500]   - I mean, one thing that keeps coming through here
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:35.340]   is that whether or not one's talking about high volume
[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:37.860]   or low volume or endurance or strength,
[02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:39.900]   quality, quality, quality.
[02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:41.060]   - Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:32:41.060 --> 02:32:43.780]   - Everything else is potentially detrimental
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:46.180]   and frankly, has added a lot of confusion
[02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:49.060]   to the fitness literature, where people, I think,
[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:52.180]   they're doing five sets of five or do I do 10 sets of 10?
[02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:57.180]   And if I may, this isn't my field of expertise,
[02:32:57.180 --> 02:33:00.960]   but again, having been in and around it for a while,
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:03.460]   I feel like the message that keeps coming through
[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:04.780]   that's going to deliver the results
[02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:07.700]   is every single repetition, high quality.
[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:09.380]   The rest period, high quality.
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:12.060]   Whatever that may be, walking around, shaking it off.
[02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:15.060]   The structuring of the program, high quality.
[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:17.440]   I think people are far too haphazard
[02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:20.900]   and seeking the pump and soreness and some sweat
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:23.460]   so that they can have their post-workout shake.
[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:24.300]   Well, I'm not trying to be-
[02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:25.140]   - And a selfie.
[02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:26.980]   - And a selfie between every set.
[02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:30.260]   And just kind of check the box.
[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:32.140]   Even for people that aren't competitive athletes,
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:34.660]   I think there's just such an enormous range of things
[02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:38.340]   to be gleaned from taking one's fitness training seriously.
[02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:41.700]   Even the word fitness is kind of a strange word.
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:43.340]   Training seriously, right?
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:44.740]   I've never even called it a workout.
[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:45.820]   I think I picked that up from men.
[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.840]   So you train, like I've never-
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:48.680]   - Or you practice.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:49.500]   - Or you practice.
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:50.340]   I like that very much.
[02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:53.080]   I also like the distinction between students and clients.
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:56.180]   That's a very, these are not just labels.
[02:33:56.180 --> 02:33:57.020]   I think they really-
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:57.840]   - No, they're really not.
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:59.120]   - Change our cognitive frame.
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:01.660]   - In the Soviet system,
[02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:03.540]   when you're talking about your training session,
[02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:06.380]   oftentimes it was referred to as a lesson.
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:08.460]   When various qualities were developed,
[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:09.980]   like strength, endurance, and so on,
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:11.540]   Verkhoshansky, for example,
[02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:15.140]   often mentioned that education of qualities.
[02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:17.360]   And at Strong First,
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:21.200]   we talk about a practice, not a workout.
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:26.020]   And a great line that was written 100 years ago
[02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:29.860]   by Earl Litterman in his "Secrets of Strength."
[02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:33.580]   And back then, strength athletes understood
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:36.800]   the importance of not training on the nerve.
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:38.840]   So they understood, you just train,
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:40.620]   and then eventually you're gonna go for a PR,
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:43.700]   but the rest of the time, you don't kill yourself.
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:45.660]   And when he's describing kind of this
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:50.340]   early adherence to this high intensity, whatever,
[02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:51.860]   and he's referring to him, he says,
[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:55.300]   "He has literally worked himself out."
[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:56.420]   And he says that that's something
[02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:58.420]   that a strength seeker cannot afford.
[02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:02.260]   So semantically, when you're trying to work yourself out,
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:04.520]   that you're trying to exhaust yourself,
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:06.900]   or are you trying to practice, to excel,
[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:08.440]   to get better at something?
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:10.140]   And that applies to any quality,
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:14.380]   because endurance very much has a skill component,
[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:16.780]   just like strength, because the ability
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:20.520]   to reuse the elastic properties of the tissues,
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:23.980]   the ability to relax between the contractions
[02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:25.860]   to restore the circulation,
[02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:28.340]   the ability to maintain the proper posture,
[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:29.840]   and so on and so forth, these are all skills.
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:32.080]   The breathing, breathing skill, huge.
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:34.100]   Extremely important for strength,
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:36.180]   for endurance, for absolutely anything.
[02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:38.580]   And if you're going through this mindlessly,
[02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:42.020]   it's, yeah, nobody's gonna get very far this way.
[02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:45.100]   - Okay, so while one could use resistance training
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:47.620]   in order to generate strength and endurance,
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:49.260]   you explained how to do that,
[02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:50.580]   there are a good number of people out there,
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:52.660]   including myself, that sometimes like to get outside
[02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:54.680]   for a run or to hike,
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:57.900]   as you mentioned earlier about the rucksack.
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:35:59.340]   I'm not such a fan of the rucksack
[02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:00.460]   because of being pitched forward,
[02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:02.260]   but I like this idea of carrying the kettlebell
[02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:03.420]   and switching sides.
[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:05.580]   Nowadays, they also have some weight vests
[02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:09.380]   that are a little bit more close to the body
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:10.740]   that distribute the weight.
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:15.180]   What are your thoughts about going into the gym
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:17.080]   in order to do the strength training
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:20.300]   and then generating the endurance work elsewhere?
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:23.420]   To be blunt, how would one combine lifting and running
[02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:25.300]   in a way that allows one to get stronger
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:27.920]   and develop endurance, perhaps simultaneously?
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:30.780]   - If we're talking about right now,
[02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:33.020]   people who are just active, people who are not athletes,
[02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:35.340]   there are several things they need to keep in mind.
[02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:38.140]   One is the timing, relative timing,
[02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:40.380]   of strength work and endurance work.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:43.500]   If the strength exercises that you're doing
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:46.340]   are primarily neural adaptations,
[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:47.780]   as to what you're targeting,
[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:50.420]   which means lower repetitions, heavier stuff,
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:52.640]   then it's important to be fresh
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:55.120]   when you're doing the exercise.
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:57.500]   It's not really, doesn't matter as much
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:58.940]   what happens afterwards.
[02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:02.300]   So which means that you could do some heavy deadlifts,
[02:37:02.300 --> 02:37:03.700]   you know, heavy deadlifts,
[02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:06.500]   and then a few hours later, you can go for a hike.
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:07.740]   On the other hand,
[02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:12.740]   if your lifting is more hypertrophy oriented,
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:15.820]   it's less important if you come in tired.
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:17.540]   It's okay even if you just hiked in the morning
[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.060]   and then you went, did your curls.
[02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:23.440]   But afterwards, for 36, 48 hours,
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:26.880]   it's ideally to restrict endurance exercise.
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:28.420]   So because you're really going to have
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:30.340]   a massive conflict right there,
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:33.580]   and it's not a good idea to do that.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:35.740]   If you're doing our preferred workout,
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:37.000]   let's say sets of five reps.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.020]   Five reps, again, they address both endurance and strength.
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:41.900]   Well, I guess you better keep a window
[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:43.700]   on both ends right there.
[02:37:43.700 --> 02:37:45.020]   There's always a conflict.
[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:46.980]   You know, Thomas Sowell said there are no solutions,
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:50.620]   there are only compromises.
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:53.880]   So you just have to decide which way you want to compromise.
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:57.320]   But that separation in time really does help.
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.180]   The other thing is spending different times
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.340]   when you focus on one thing versus the other.
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:02.460]   So the next two months,
[02:38:02.460 --> 02:38:05.100]   you're going to spend on hitting your strength hard,
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:06.580]   and you're just going to do two hikes a week
[02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:09.020]   just for your health, just to maintain.
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:10.380]   And then summer rolls around,
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:14.120]   and you put your lifting on the back burner.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.380]   You lift less, not necessarily lighter, just less.
[02:38:18.380 --> 02:38:20.400]   And you spend a lot more time outdoors
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:22.820]   and do these different things.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:28.480]   Keeping in mind also the duration of training.
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:32.480]   So the longer your training session is of any kind,
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:35.940]   the more you are triggering adaptations
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:40.940]   that are more in favor of endurance.
[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:43.220]   So your cortisol level goes up,
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:45.380]   and there are some other things that do happen
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:48.040]   that drive you towards endurance as opposed to strength.
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:50.280]   So even in your strength training,
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:51.960]   don't make the sessions too long.
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:52.900]   - What's too long?
[02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:56.280]   - It's really hard to know at this point.
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:38:58.280]   In the Soviet weightlifting practice,
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:01.020]   the top guys would spend two and two and a half hours.
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:03.960]   They would, for them, that worked, that seemed appropriate.
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:05.160]   But then again, don't forget,
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:07.100]   at that point, they're juicing.
[02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:10.660]   And in the pre-steroid areas, those times are shorter.
[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:13.660]   And this is one of the differences in steroids, by the way,
[02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:16.260]   that's in your training when you use steroids or not.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:18.620]   As I mentioned earlier,
[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:21.120]   Soviets established the correlation
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:26.120]   with the volume of lifting and muscle mass.
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:27.640]   That's one thing.
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:29.560]   They also established correlation
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:34.240]   between volume of lifting at 80% or higher and strength.
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:37.640]   And the correlation is very strong, 0.84.
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:41.400]   However, if you're talking about the muscle mass
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:42.760]   with that lighter stuff,
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:45.360]   some lifters would just get great results,
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:47.840]   and some lifters would just get more endurance.
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:50.380]   And they found that guys who are juicing,
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:51.960]   they can keep doing higher volumes
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:54.440]   and still keep getting more muscular.
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.100]   But the guys who are not, who are clean,
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:39:58.920]   they're just not able to do that.
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:01.480]   So trial and error, probably,
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:03.360]   like Marty Gallagher says, fill an hour.
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:07.080]   I think that's a safe guideline, fill an hour.
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:08.440]   - Yeah, I like the fill an hour.
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:11.160]   I don't think I've ever spent more than an hour
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:16.160]   of actual work in the gym, maybe 75 minutes or so.
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:18.660]   I notice if I train longer than that,
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:21.920]   I pay a serious price in terms of post-exercise fatigue
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:23.060]   later in the day.
[02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:26.000]   I'd actually like to talk about this concept.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.720]   I looked it up before sitting down today.
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:30.080]   There's a little bit of literature starting to emerge,
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:31.860]   not as much as I would like,
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:35.880]   about post-exercise cholinergic depletion.
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:38.700]   So much of our ability to hold our attention
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:40.800]   is dependent on epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:42.840]   and acetylcholine release in the brain.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:45.060]   And of course, muscular contractions,
[02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:46.800]   acetylcholine being the dominant transmitter
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:50.160]   from nerve to muscle, communication.
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.680]   But this idea that if we exercise too intensely,
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:56.440]   or even if we just do cognitive work
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:58.820]   that's very intense for a period of time,
[02:40:58.820 --> 02:41:02.160]   that there's this post-exercise cholinergic depletion,
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.800]   and then we get this, what people typically call brain fog,
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:07.160]   although that's not a real medical term.
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:09.760]   So I think from the practical standpoint,
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:14.040]   a lot of people who would like to train more for strength,
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:15.680]   train more often for strength,
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:17.920]   do strength and endurance work,
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.960]   that the challenge sometimes isn't just scheduling it,
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:24.380]   it's that we feel depleted and tired afterward.
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:25.520]   Have you observed this?
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:28.120]   And is there a way to use strength training
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:31.240]   or other forms of training to improve cognitive function?
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:33.760]   Because again, as you pointed out,
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:35.960]   only compromises, not solutions.
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:37.960]   But I do see a world in which one
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:40.800]   could use their physical training to give them a,
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:43.160]   for lack of a better word, a boost into the day.
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:46.640]   So you're getting stronger, you're developing your health,
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:48.720]   and you're also able to then lean into your day
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.240]   with more focus and intention.
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:53.040]   That would be the ultimate scenario, yeah.
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.500]   - Well, there's obviously, we're looking at a zero-sum game.
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:57.840]   So there's, you only have so much,
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:59.900]   you know, your resources are limited.
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:03.980]   One thing that will absolutely help is fragmentation.
[02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:07.340]   It's been proven that dividing up a given workload
[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:09.660]   into smaller chunks allows you,
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:11.580]   doesn't matter what it is, whether it's endurance training
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:13.900]   or strength training or some cognitive work,
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:16.580]   you're able to, you're able to do more.
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:19.060]   And that's one thing that to consider.
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:24.060]   The other is obviously the feedback.
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:27.280]   You know, you have to listen to your body, pretty much.
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.280]   Soviets stressed very much that you have
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:30.920]   to take the cybernetic approach.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:32.040]   You have to have the feedback,
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:34.240]   no matter what the training plan says.
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:37.180]   Arkady Zvabiv says you have to listen to,
[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:39.340]   you have to listen to that feedback.
[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:42.200]   And freshness in the Soviet system of strength training,
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:45.400]   and not just in weightlifting, freshness was paramount.
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:48.620]   It's even better, let's talk about how track athletes
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:50.120]   in the Soviet Union trained for strength.
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:52.440]   And that's more, that's will be even more applicable
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:54.360]   to a lot of the listeners,
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:56.320]   because they definitely didn't spend two and a half hours
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:58.000]   in the, you know, in the gym.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.040]   So professor Vladimir Dyachkov, he was a head coach,
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:05.560]   and he was one of the first to implement heavy lifting
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:09.200]   for the track, after, right after the Soviets decided,
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:10.920]   hey, look at these Americans, you know,
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:12.520]   lifting heavy weights, Bruce Randall
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:14.840]   and Paul Anderson and Canadian Doug Hepburn.
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.620]   So these lifters, he has absolutely says,
[02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:21.380]   always do low reps.
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:23.820]   So they would never do more than three, four reps,
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:26.900]   even with the lightest weight, even with a warmup weight.
[02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:30.500]   They spent a lot of time doing just singles and doubles,
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:33.380]   and it was absolutely essential that they stayed fresh.
[02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:36.420]   And part of it was just the, how they felt,
[02:43:36.420 --> 02:43:38.500]   part of it is the performance, how well they jumped
[02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:40.620]   and so on, and how they felt after.
[02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:43.060]   So they found if you're really obsessive about it,
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:45.780]   you have that tonic effect that lasts
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:47.840]   at least until the next day.
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:51.000]   And the tonic effect is both for your strength,
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.920]   for your power, but also for, you know,
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:55.880]   your cognitive functions as well.
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:43:58.920]   But it's also very, very interesting that,
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:02.380]   here's an idea, do a bench press before the next day,
[02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:04.780]   before you're competing in a jump,
[02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:07.020]   or do a heavy squat the day before
[02:44:07.020 --> 02:44:08.920]   you're competing as a thrower.
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:10.400]   So it's, again, it's very interesting
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:13.040]   how the opposite part of the body stimulating
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:16.800]   that was very, very helpful, very interesting phenomena.
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:20.400]   So they found if the strength work is familiar
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:23.800]   and non-exhaustive, it absolutely facilitates
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:26.000]   whatever it is that you do afterwards.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.880]   And restricting, this is where the difference,
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.960]   this is where track athletes were very different
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:34.800]   from a lot of other people.
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:37.640]   They tried to restrict their volume as much as possible
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:40.000]   of strength training, in part because,
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.840]   well, they had to do other things,
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.080]   and because they had to stay fresh.
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.920]   So if you look at the volume,
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:48.040]   if you look at, generally speaking,
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.800]   how many repetitions that you want to perform
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.480]   for exercise, for training session,
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:57.520]   and again, these are purely empirical numbers.
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:59.240]   They come from Soviet weightlifting,
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:02.360]   but they were also applied in track.
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.680]   So the minimal volume is 10 to 20 repetitions total.
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:08.400]   So minimal.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:12.400]   And optimal is 20 to 30.
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:15.880]   Maximal, it becomes 30 to 50 in that window.
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:18.040]   So when you're looking at 20 to 30 reps,
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:20.240]   maybe on the lower end right there,
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:22.800]   you're going to build strength.
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:27.160]   And if you also are going to not go to failure
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:29.400]   and rest sufficiently between sets,
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:31.240]   unless you're greasing the groove,
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:33.200]   you need to look at at least five minutes pretty much,
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.960]   and that's both for neural and biochemical reasons,
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.280]   but more is really better.
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:40.040]   Unfortunately, really a lot of it
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:42.320]   is just comes down to listening to your body
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:43.560]   and just using your judgment.
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:46.600]   I wish I had any better, I wish I had any better answer here.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:47.960]   - I think it's a terrific answer.
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:51.120]   I like to leave the gym with some gas in the tank
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:55.200]   because, well, I get paid to think and to speak,
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.600]   as it were, not to lift, but--
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:45:59.840]   - And many great thinkers in the strength world,
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:02.840]   starting from Liedermann back 100 years ago
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:07.840]   to Soviet weightlifting authorities like, you know,
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:10.960]   Rodionov and Roman,
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:14.120]   and later on somebody like even Steve Just,
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:15.760]   that was a very colorful individual,
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:19.920]   just brilliant, brilliant strength athlete,
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:23.320]   a farmer from Nebraska,
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:25.480]   who just came up with some fantastic protocols,
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:27.880]   but he would say that you've got to finish stronger
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:29.000]   than when you started.
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:29.840]   - I love that.
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:33.960]   - And that theme is very much permeates professional
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.920]   or high-level strength training,
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:38.120]   where this mentality of a workout
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:41.480]   or try to get smoked or pumped or throw up in the bucket,
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:44.080]   they would look at you as that's insane.
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:47.560]   One of the reasons that also Soviets restricted
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:49.000]   the number of reps in the squad,
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.720]   because you do sets of 10 in the squad,
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.040]   you're gonna definitely put on some mass,
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:53.640]   no question about it.
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:56.280]   But one of the reasons they restricted that,
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:57.840]   very few people did sets of 10,
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:00.840]   except for heavyweights who had a hard time bulking,
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:03.160]   and even more, is like, okay,
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:05.360]   that's too much cardiorespiratory stress.
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.080]   And even though Soviet weightlifters
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:09.720]   did some general physical training,
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:12.600]   like cross-country running or playing soccer,
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:14.200]   but they're not trying to get their cardio
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:16.360]   on the lifting platform,
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:18.600]   that has just made no sense whatsoever.
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:21.320]   So restricting the reps will go a very long way,
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:24.840]   increasing the rest periods to at least five minutes
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:26.520]   would go a very long way,
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:28.680]   and restricting the number of exercises,
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:29.920]   because people don't realize
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:31.280]   that you're using different muscle groups,
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:32.920]   but still using the same brain.
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:34.920]   You're still using the same adrenals.
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.320]   And all that stuff really adds up.
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:40.800]   So I would say two, during one practice,
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:42.640]   one training practice,
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:45.680]   maybe two, maybe three exercises max lifts.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.760]   And nothing wrong with doing just one.
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:49.880]   And yeah, if you wanna do your curls
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:52.680]   and whatever, calves later, that's fine,
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:54.760]   but you can tack it on in the end,
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:56.200]   or you can do it totally separate.
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:58.320]   Those things don't really zap you.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:47:59.800]   You can just come in on a separate day
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:02.080]   and just do your, enjoy your calf burn.
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:02.920]   - Love it.
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:05.560]   There seems to be an over-reliance nowadays
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:09.080]   on pre-workout stimulants.
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.760]   I'm a big consumer of caffeine
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:12.360]   in the form of Yerba Mate and coffee.
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:14.320]   I'm old school that way.
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:15.480]   Not that I won't- - I enjoy my coffee.
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:18.680]   - Yeah, you still drink coffee every day?
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:19.520]   - Yes, I do. - Yeah.
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:21.080]   - But only twice, got a moderation.
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:22.080]   - Moderation, right.
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:25.760]   These days, there's a lot of emphasis
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:30.400]   on just trying to get as absolutely wired
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:32.200]   and geared up for training.
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:35.080]   And I think that in part contributes
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:39.120]   to why people feel this post-exercise fatigue.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:41.840]   They go hit the gym hard after a pre-workout,
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:43.400]   and then they're doing their post-workout shake
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:46.560]   and a bunch of carbohydrates to replenish their glycogen.
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:48.400]   And then of course, two hours later,
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:49.280]   you wanna take a nap.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:50.320]   I mean, it's amazing.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:53.160]   Anyone could study or do anything at that point.
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:54.880]   I think that's very different
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:56.380]   than the kind of training you're describing.
[02:48:56.380 --> 02:48:59.380]   I also just, so I'd love your thoughts
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:01.400]   on stimulants generally,
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:04.660]   and how they can support or hinder performance.
[02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:09.520]   And I'm also curious about just what's lost in that model
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:13.760]   in terms of learning how to cycle one's energy up and down.
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:16.100]   Several times today, you've mentioned this thing
[02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:18.180]   of the ability to relax the muscles
[02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:21.340]   and relax the nervous system in between sets,
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:23.740]   maybe even in between reps, who knows,
[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:25.580]   but usually between sets and certainly-
[02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:27.980]   - And sometimes between reps under certain circumstances.
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:28.940]   - Interesting. - Absolutely, yeah.
[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:31.220]   - Yeah, so maybe we talk about stimulants.
[02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:33.060]   Before we started today, we were talking about
[02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:35.980]   when stimulants can actually hinder performance,
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:36.860]   when they can help.
[02:49:36.860 --> 02:49:38.340]   And then maybe we talk about the cycling
[02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:40.640]   of tension and relaxation,
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:42.680]   because I look at training physically
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:46.620]   as a venue for exploring nervous system function
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:48.300]   and control over nervous system generally
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:49.520]   that one can apply elsewhere.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:52.100]   So that's the kind of theme I'll just roll out onto the table.
[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:53.860]   - Well, first of all, I'll preface it by saying
[02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:56.620]   that stimulants and any kind of pharmacy
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:49:57.820]   is totally out of my wheelhouse.
[02:49:57.820 --> 02:50:01.700]   So what I'm about to say is purely reflected knowledge.
[02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:03.620]   You know, with your neurobiology background,
[02:50:03.620 --> 02:50:05.340]   you can tell the listeners so much more
[02:50:05.340 --> 02:50:07.080]   than I could possibly can.
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:11.260]   But top athletes, when they compete after a competition,
[02:50:11.260 --> 02:50:12.980]   I'm talking about strength sports,
[02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:15.320]   like powerlifting or weightlifting,
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:18.900]   for the next two weeks, they're just gone.
[02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:20.700]   They're completely flat.
[02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:23.340]   Because there are two adaptations
[02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:28.260]   that take place in strength training,
[02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:29.780]   proper strength training.
[02:50:29.780 --> 02:50:33.220]   So on one hand, it's much more economical function
[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:34.460]   of the adrenal glands.
[02:50:34.460 --> 02:50:37.060]   On the other hand, it's much higher capacity as well.
[02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:40.020]   So these are the guys and gals who are able
[02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:43.180]   to crank it up really, really high when they want to,
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:45.180]   but they're also able to really keep it down
[02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:46.700]   when they don't have to.
[02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:49.420]   And they do know that for the next two weeks
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:53.820]   after the competition, or after some idiotic gym max,
[02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:55.460]   you know, that might take a week,
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:50:57.140]   they are, they're gonna be flat.
[02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:59.300]   They're gonna be completely gone.
[02:50:59.300 --> 02:51:02.240]   So you really have to spare your adrenaline.
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:07.240]   The lifters who take heavy lifts in the gym,
[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:10.940]   they still, typically they stay at the training max,
[02:51:10.940 --> 02:51:12.260]   not the competition max.
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:13.300]   So what's a training max?
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:17.220]   A training max, it's the heaviest weight
[02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:20.380]   that you can possibly lift without getting
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:21.900]   too excited about it.
[02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:26.740]   And back in the '50s, Luchkin,
[02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:29.580]   he was one of the fathers of Soviet weightlifting.
[02:51:29.580 --> 02:51:33.780]   He came up with a great tactic how to find that weight.
[02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:37.820]   If your heart rate goes up before the set,
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.460]   that's too heavy.
[02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:42.900]   So that you gotta, like you gotta monitor yourself,
[02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:44.020]   unless you're in competition.
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:45.960]   Of course, that's a different game.
[02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:51.960]   If, I will defer to others about how much one should
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:56.720]   or could take stimulants before training,
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:58.480]   lifting, I'm talking about.
[02:51:58.480 --> 02:52:00.920]   But generally speaking, you gotta do it in moderation.
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:03.160]   And especially you gotta save it for the times
[02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:04.000]   when you really need it.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.600]   Like in the American powerlifting system,
[02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:09.040]   when you have during week three and four,
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:10.660]   that's a good time to do it.
[02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:13.120]   During the weeks one and two when the weights are lighter,
[02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:14.680]   let your adrenals recover,
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:16.840]   and you don't need to push yourself as hard anyway.
[02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:20.800]   So it's just one example how to go about this.
[02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:23.600]   If you have to drink some stupid energy drink
[02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.040]   to just get yourself up to training,
[02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:27.520]   there's something wrong in your life possibly.
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:29.640]   It is something that's a lifestyle choices
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:31.200]   and you need to address it.
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:34.280]   If you're always feel exhausted after training,
[02:52:34.280 --> 02:52:36.160]   you're missing out on life.
[02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:39.000]   I mean, if you're doing a very, a desk job
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.200]   that does not require high cognitive ability,
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:44.400]   something that's really mechanical with pen and paper
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:47.280]   or computer, and you choose to just destroy yourself
[02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:50.760]   on a daily basis with a lot of sets to failure
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:53.680]   or med cons or whatever it is, well, it's your choice
[02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:55.320]   if you wanna destroy your life like that.
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:57.280]   But again, if you look at your adrenal profile,
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:00.780]   if you look at your sympathetic dominance,
[02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:02.520]   if you look at your how you're just feeling
[02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:04.160]   is gonna be really, really awful.
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:10.320]   The other angle to this is, as we talked earlier,
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:12.880]   in learning and skill training, skill practices,
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:16.680]   learning, current performance is not indicative of learning.
[02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:19.080]   So just because you're able to lift five pounds more
[02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:21.620]   because you got yourself all jacked up on some drink,
[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:23.920]   doesn't mean you necessarily got stronger.
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:26.120]   So you just need to come in and put in your practice
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:27.360]   and walk away and come back.
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:29.680]   And then when there's time and it's the day to go heavier,
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:31.240]   that's when you do that.
[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:34.360]   So don't want to discourage you from drinking coffee.
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:35.800]   In fact, if you drink a stimulant,
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:36.940]   coffee should be the only thing.
[02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:40.000]   The rest of this stuff is, I don't know.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:41.320]   - Yeah, coffee, tea.
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:45.600]   - Coffee, tea, and then figure out, again,
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:48.520]   figure out what is that moderate, moderate amount,
[02:53:48.520 --> 02:53:50.760]   figure out how to use it when you truly need it,
[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:53.360]   as opposed to be relying on it all the time.
[02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:55.360]   - Would you mind, before we go to the next question,
[02:53:55.360 --> 02:53:57.280]   if I just share with you a result
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:59.600]   that I just wanted to plant in your brain,
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:01.120]   'cause I've been excited to tell you about this,
[02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:03.240]   'cause it's new results from the field of neuroscience
[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:05.360]   that I don't think anyone's discussed anywhere,
[02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:06.640]   but I think you might find interesting
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:08.680]   for your sake of discussion here,
[02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:09.960]   but also for other work. - Thank you, Andrew.
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:10.880]   Looking forward to it.
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:13.040]   - I didn't do this study, I wish I had.
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:15.080]   The study, very briefly,
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:19.060]   is interested in the neural basis of choking,
[02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:20.440]   not choking someone out
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:22.040]   or not anything else related to choking,
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:25.640]   but when one feels that the stakes are really high
[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:28.440]   and suddenly ability falls away.
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:29.560]   What is that?
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:31.360]   So what they did is they developed this game
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:34.160]   where essentially the potential payoff in this game,
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:36.040]   while recording from neurons in the brain,
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:38.760]   is either low, medium, or very high,
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:40.700]   or the occasional jackpot,
[02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:42.960]   like you could just win the whole thing,
[02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:46.700]   and the payoff is very, very considerable.
[02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:48.880]   Then they looked at the amount
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:50.480]   of upper motor neuron recruitment,
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:51.760]   so essentially the areas of the brain
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:56.360]   that drive coordinated muscular behavior or action,
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:54:58.400]   and what they found is that it basically scales
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.480]   with the level of reward.
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:02.040]   So you get more neuronal engagement
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:03.720]   as the reward scales up.
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:06.400]   However, every time the jackpot was offered,
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.400]   it over-engages too many motor neurons,
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.960]   and so this notion of choking
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:13.800]   when the stakes are really, really high.
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:15.800]   - So you have irradiation that you cannot control.
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:17.840]   - Exactly, it's like spillover of like,
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:18.680]   it's like too much,
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:20.080]   we could call it too much excitement,
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:21.600]   but it's not adrenaline in this case,
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:23.440]   although that's probably associated with it.
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:25.840]   But you think, oh, great, I'm gonna get an award,
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:27.240]   I'm gonna get an even bigger award.
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:29.960]   Okay, oh my goodness, this could change everything.
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:33.040]   And all of a sudden, performance just tanks.
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:35.480]   And so it turns out it's a brain thing
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:37.360]   at the level of over-recruitment,
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:38.720]   which just speaks to this idea
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:42.080]   of being able to maintain arousal within a certain range
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:44.360]   is an essential skill to any performer.
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:45.200]   I just thought I'd share that.
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:46.040]   - And also, thank you, that's fantastic.
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:47.080]   - 'Cause it's a fun set of results.
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:47.920]   - That's always consistent with what we know.
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:49.960]   - And since I was a little kid, if I learned something,
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:52.800]   I have to share it with somebody who I think might care.
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:56.440]   So if ever people wonder about why people choke,
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:55:59.320]   it is hyper-arousal at the level of the brain,
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:02.040]   apparently not so much the body.
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:03.680]   - Well, being able to control arousal,
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:06.720]   it's such a key skill for an athlete,
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:09.640]   and part of that, obviously,
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:12.320]   it should be directed at sports psychologists,
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:14.480]   and there are some fantastic techniques.
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:17.120]   For example, Dr. Judd Byasodo,
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:20.720]   who is an author who published a book with Strong First,
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:24.120]   Dr. Judd squatted 602 at body weight of 132,
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:25.520]   and that was back in the '80s.
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:29.800]   He was in his 40s after a serious back injury, surgery,
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:31.600]   and he's a sports psychologist,
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.760]   and he discusses these various skills.
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:35.160]   It's fascinating.
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:38.440]   His control of excitation inhibition was such
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:41.000]   that he would sleep between attempts.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:42.600]   A couple of minutes before the attempt,
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:44.800]   his handler or coach would wake him up.
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:48.000]   He would wake up, he'd get himself into frenzy,
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.080]   he'd lift the weight, he'd go back to sleep,
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:52.240]   nine times a day throughout the day.
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:55.280]   Now, that's a mastery of excitation inhibition,
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:57.160]   your on-switch and off-switch.
[02:56:57.160 --> 02:57:00.740]   So part of that is sports psychology.
[02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:03.440]   There are tools in sports psychology for that.
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.320]   Part of it is training, is whatever you do in the gym,
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:09.960]   some of your habits and some of your practices.
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:13.200]   Like for example, okay,
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:15.680]   David Riggert is one of the greatest weightlifters
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:16.520]   of all time.
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:18.400]   Some people would say the greatest weightlifter
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:19.240]   of all times.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:23.320]   And when he was discovered by Rudolf Pflugfelder,
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:25.880]   his coach, who was another Olympic champion,
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:27.240]   world champion,
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:30.560]   one of the things that the coach was impressed with
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:33.560]   is that Riggert would do his set,
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:36.420]   and then after his set, he would just go completely limp,
[02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:37.920]   like a rag.
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:39.480]   And he was very impressed with that.
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:42.040]   Later in Riggert's career,
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:43.920]   when he was a world champion already,
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:46.080]   in the United States,
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:48.680]   so there's an American coach who writes
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:50.520]   how he saw him in Columbus, Ohio,
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:53.120]   or Cleveland, Ohio, competing back in the '70s.
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:56.760]   He was lying and smoking a cigarette.
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:59.620]   And then he gets up, he snatches 60 kilos,
[02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:02.280]   like 135 pounds or something once.
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:04.760]   Then he just picks up something else equally trivial,
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:07.200]   and then he goes and does his first attempts,
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:10.880]   and then ends up with a superior performance.
[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:15.880]   At a different time, Riggert bet a box of cognac
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:17.960]   that he would snatch 90% of his max,
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:22.960]   which his max was probably around 370 or something.
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:25.200]   So he was able to snatch 90% of that,
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:27.560]   no warmup whatsoever.
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:30.900]   And so this is this ability of that incredible control.
[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:33.460]   So part of it is whatever you're born with,
[02:58:33.460 --> 02:58:35.620]   part of it is sports psychology techniques,
[02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:38.020]   but part of it is developing some habits.
[02:58:38.020 --> 02:58:41.120]   As soon as you're done with your lift, just power down.
[02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:44.380]   Incidentally, after training,
[02:58:44.380 --> 02:58:48.300]   a strength athlete ought to perform a cool down.
[02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:53.300]   And Russians did some numbers on powerlifters,
[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:55.900]   and they found that the top powerlifters,
[02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:57.160]   they spend time in cool down,
[02:58:57.160 --> 02:58:59.200]   and the guys who are not so good, they don't.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:01.440]   Because not only, it just allows you
[02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:02.880]   to bring your excitation down,
[02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:05.380]   get your power sympathetic, get you to start recovering.
[02:59:05.380 --> 02:59:08.480]   So you do some easy stretching, you do some meditating,
[02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:11.400]   you do some breathing exercises, whatever you do.
[02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:12.960]   But even after each set,
[02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:16.240]   so you put up that heavy deadlift or squat,
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:18.520]   and then you just immediately come down,
[02:59:18.520 --> 02:59:20.720]   and then you walk around and you chill.
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:24.560]   So you just try to tune your switch so much.
[02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:27.060]   Breathing exercises come in handy for that.
[02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:29.980]   There are breathing exercises to increase your excitation.
[02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:32.660]   There are breathing exercises that are able
[02:59:32.660 --> 02:59:35.620]   to very much put you in a state of inhibition,
[02:59:35.620 --> 02:59:37.300]   very deep inhibition, even.
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:40.060]   Some of them are hypercapnic, some are hypoxic,
[02:59:40.060 --> 02:59:42.620]   which means you try to increase carbon dioxide,
[02:59:42.620 --> 02:59:44.760]   or you're trying to decrease oxygen.
[02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:46.140]   There are some very sophisticated,
[02:59:46.140 --> 02:59:47.900]   yet really quite simple techniques
[02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:51.740]   that can help you do that.
[02:59:51.740 --> 02:59:53.760]   - I love this concept of just learning
[02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:57.360]   to push on the accelerator, push on the brake,
[02:59:57.360 --> 02:59:59.360]   and to play with disinhibition.
[02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:01.840]   As a first person to come on this podcast,
[03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:04.320]   even among the neuroscientists I've spoken with,
[03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:05.560]   to talk about disinhibition.
[03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:06.400]   - Really?
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:07.220]   - Thank you for bringing that up.
[03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:08.060]   - Well, the history of that--
[03:00:08.060 --> 03:00:08.900]   - That's a beautiful concept,
[03:00:08.900 --> 03:00:10.400]   and an important one for how we function.
[03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:12.760]   - That absolutely is.
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:14.080]   The original research was done
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:17.960]   in the '60s, Ickei and Steinhaus, 1961, I believe.
[03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:20.380]   And then later on, that was a big part
[03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:23.440]   of the training method of Dr. Fred Hadfield.
[03:00:23.440 --> 03:00:27.240]   Fred Hadfield is a legend in the iron game.
[03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:31.520]   He was one of the first to squat 1,000 pounds
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:35.960]   in competition, and he was just a fantastic lifter
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:38.240]   and just brilliant scientist.
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:41.800]   So he tried to direct a lot of the training
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:43.480]   towards disinhibition.
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:45.420]   So he even developed special techniques
[03:00:45.420 --> 03:00:48.200]   that are largely forgotten, ironically.
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:50.240]   But yes, disinhibition is huge.
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:54.280]   And it's also one of the things about disinhibition, too,
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:57.800]   it's also very important to avoid failing,
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:02.480]   because never failing a lift, that's part of disinhibition.
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:04.200]   So like we talked about Ed Cohen earlier,
[03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:05.800]   another one of the power lifting greats.
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:08.500]   Ed Cohen competed over several decades,
[03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:12.340]   set over 70 world records in several weight classes,
[03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:15.760]   only missed a couple lifts in competition,
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:18.080]   never missed a training lift whatsoever.
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:22.020]   Always calm, always composed, an amazing lifter, amazing guy.
[03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:24.520]   And what's very likely happened
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:28.160]   is that his inhibitory pathways just shriveled
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:30.480]   and got pruned and died.
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:32.160]   What people don't realize that, you know,
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:34.440]   greasing the groove, that's the term,
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:36.400]   proper term, long-term potentiation,
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:38.840]   is like when you are getting better at,
[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:41.000]   like that transmission gets stronger.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.280]   It's like your nerves become superconductors.
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:47.160]   But there's also its evil twin, long-term depression.
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:49.840]   So pretty much what happens is now you're trying as hard,
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:53.460]   but your muscles are not jumping in response anymore.
[03:01:53.460 --> 03:01:58.360]   So one of the ways to get this long-term depression
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:00.440]   is by failing.
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:02.120]   So whenever you're attempting certain thing,
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:04.720]   and if it doesn't happen, that's a way,
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:07.240]   that pathway starts firing weaker,
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:10.040]   and the inhibitory pathways start becoming stronger.
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.100]   And it becomes even worse if you're emotional about it.
[03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:16.200]   So you said quite a few things about adrenaline,
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:21.200]   but adrenaline has, adrenaline does promote neuroplasticity,
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:23.160]   but not always in a good way.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:26.480]   So if you look at the PTSD treatments,
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:30.960]   you will find that if a person re-experiences that bad,
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:32.600]   whatever thing that happened,
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:34.280]   and then it gets into the feedback loop,
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:36.560]   that positive feedback, positive doesn't mean good,
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:38.860]   positive, it just means it keeps increasing it,
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:41.720]   because every time that there's a spike of adrenaline,
[03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:43.800]   that reinforces the memory.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:45.400]   So if you miss the attempt,
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:47.320]   and you also got really upset about it,
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:48.520]   and you remember it again,
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:50.800]   so you're making yourself weaker and weaker,
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:53.720]   which reminds me of a very fascinating way
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:56.720]   that the ancients used for,
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:02:59.900]   to record some events before there's writing.
[03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:05.400]   So let's say there's a wedding between VIP families.
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:07.600]   They bring a kid, young kid, seven-year-old, let's say,
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:09.800]   and make the kid watch the whole thing.
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:11.880]   And after the festivities,
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:13.620]   they throw the kid into the river.
[03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:16.440]   The kid crawls out of the river,
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:19.280]   and he doesn't know, he doesn't expect it.
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:20.680]   And the kid climbs out of the river,
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:21.920]   and he's gonna remember that wedding
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:22.760]   for the rest of his life.
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:23.960]   He's gonna hold that record.
[03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:25.340]   - Because of the adrenaline spike,
[03:03:25.340 --> 03:03:26.180]   associated with the cold water. - Exactly.
[03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:28.800]   So that really did increase the neuroplasticity,
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:31.240]   so that memory became really deeply ingrained.
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:36.240]   So yeah, part of disinhibition is not promoting inhibition,
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:38.260]   is just not failing.
[03:03:38.260 --> 03:03:40.960]   So Fred Hatfield had a beautiful line,
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:43.720]   "Success begets success, failure begets failure."
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:45.520]   Train to success, not to failure.
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:47.120]   - Do you recommend actually
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:49.240]   avoiding training to muscular failure?
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:51.660]   - Absolutely.
[03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:53.020]   There is really no reason for that.
[03:03:53.020 --> 03:03:55.000]   If you're doing that with
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.800]   single joint bodybuilding exercises like curls,
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:03.000]   it probably doesn't matter.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.680]   And if you're doing it for bodybuilding.
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:07.240]   But I still don't see the point,
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:09.640]   because every rep closer to failure
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:13.320]   that is going to increase exponentially your recovery time.
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:15.940]   So you're not going to get quite as much.
[03:04:15.940 --> 03:04:19.640]   Yeah, you might get more muscle gain
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:21.280]   from that particular last rep,
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:23.680]   but your recovery is gonna be increased so much.
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:27.360]   And also, as you start training to failure,
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:29.800]   you're converting more of your fibers
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:32.640]   towards slower times.
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:33.480]   So on the other hand,
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:34.860]   if you don't train to failure, you don't.
[03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:37.720]   So there's an interesting Spanish study,
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:41.840]   when they found that when athletes train to failure,
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.180]   again, some of the myosin and type 2X, fast fibers,
[03:04:46.180 --> 03:04:47.280]   they converted to 2A.
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:49.540]   So they became slower,
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:52.440]   probably because now it's an endurance event.
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:54.280]   When you're training for as many reps as possible,
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:56.080]   it's really an endurance event.
[03:04:56.080 --> 03:04:56.920]   On the other hand,
[03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:58.340]   the athletes that trained
[03:04:58.340 --> 03:05:01.560]   with half the maximum possible repetitions,
[03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:03.840]   they did not experience that decline,
[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:05.560]   which goes back several decades
[03:05:05.560 --> 03:05:08.400]   to when Arkady Vorobyov, Olympic champion,
[03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:11.800]   scientist, head coach, incredible, incredible person.
[03:05:11.800 --> 03:05:15.160]   He said there is a big difference
[03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:19.160]   between six sets of three and three sets of six.
[03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:21.480]   It's because, and you think like,
[03:05:21.480 --> 03:05:24.640]   this sounds like the most obvious thing to say,
[03:05:24.640 --> 03:05:27.020]   but the fact is you build just as much strength
[03:05:27.020 --> 03:05:30.040]   with six sets of three as three sets of six,
[03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:31.640]   you get a lot less tired,
[03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:34.000]   you get to practice for three extra sets,
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:35.680]   and you can train sooner.
[03:05:35.680 --> 03:05:38.160]   So that's fundamental.
[03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:39.360]   So pushing to failure.
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:43.240]   Also, the other thing is about the control of your technique.
[03:05:43.240 --> 03:05:45.960]   Towards the last reps, there's no control left.
[03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:50.960]   But imagine that you always have that perfect technique.
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:53.940]   So you grease that pathway, that becomes a reflex.
[03:05:53.940 --> 03:05:58.020]   In fact, early on, the Soviet sports scientists
[03:05:58.020 --> 03:05:59.720]   very much view strength adaptation
[03:05:59.720 --> 03:06:01.960]   as just the development of conditional reflex.
[03:06:01.960 --> 03:06:05.280]   Kind of like Pavlov with the dogs, drooling dogs.
[03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:08.100]   And then you go into the competition
[03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:09.160]   and you psych yourself up
[03:06:09.160 --> 03:06:11.600]   and you don't even know what's going on, you're not aware,
[03:06:11.600 --> 03:06:13.000]   but you only have one pathway.
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:14.400]   There's no plan B.
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:16.640]   You only remember how to do your deadlift
[03:06:16.640 --> 03:06:19.000]   in this particular manner, no any other way.
[03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:20.080]   - The neurons are trained
[03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:22.720]   to complete the execution of the movement.
[03:06:22.720 --> 03:06:25.240]   - Exactly, and all in a very specific way,
[03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:26.520]   because there is no plan B.
[03:06:26.520 --> 03:06:28.040]   When you start failure, so you start,
[03:06:28.040 --> 03:06:29.880]   okay, this is the stressful situation,
[03:06:29.880 --> 03:06:31.760]   so I revert to plan B.
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:34.440]   But there's plan B for amateurs.
[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:36.240]   Top athletes don't have plan B.
[03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:38.760]   Watch a top lifter fail an attempt.
[03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:41.920]   He or she is gonna shake with that bar,
[03:06:41.920 --> 03:06:44.560]   shake, shake, shake, shake, and finally is gonna come down.
[03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:46.100]   But it's not like the butt's gonna shoot up
[03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:48.080]   or something ugly is going to happen.
[03:06:48.080 --> 03:06:49.920]   So going back to that point you made earlier
[03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:51.720]   about the quality of practice,
[03:06:51.720 --> 03:06:53.240]   quality is absolutely paramount.
[03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:56.600]   And strength training is a skill practice.
[03:06:56.600 --> 03:06:58.880]   Any athletic training is a skill practice.
[03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:01.560]   Maybe riding the elliptical is not a skill practice,
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:04.960]   but it's just not a sport anyway.
[03:07:04.960 --> 03:07:06.920]   It's not anything, you know.
[03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:08.040]   Even hiking's a practice.
[03:07:08.040 --> 03:07:09.320]   You're trying to stay tall,
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:11.920]   you're trying to breathe in a particular manner.
[03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:13.200]   It's all practice.
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:15.720]   - The crossovers between physical training
[03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:20.320]   and mental pursuits are astonishing to me.
[03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:21.560]   You know, as we're talking about this,
[03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:23.440]   avoiding going to failure,
[03:07:23.440 --> 03:07:26.440]   I'm in the process of writing my first book.
[03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:27.640]   I know you've written several books,
[03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:28.840]   and I'm finding it to be very different
[03:07:28.840 --> 03:07:30.080]   than anything else I've ever done.
[03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:31.920]   And the experienced writers tell me
[03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:35.800]   that you should end on a sentence
[03:07:35.800 --> 03:07:38.360]   where you kind of know what the next sentence could be,
[03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:41.200]   perhaps to seed the unconscious mind for the next day,
[03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:43.880]   but that you don't want to run right up until a wall
[03:07:43.880 --> 03:07:46.360]   and like bang your head against that wall,
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:48.320]   metaphorically speaking,
[03:07:48.320 --> 03:07:51.080]   because it places a kind of frustration
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:52.080]   into your nervous system
[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:54.920]   that you arrive to the page with the next day.
[03:07:54.920 --> 03:07:56.400]   I guess the opposite could be argued too,
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:08:00.560]   but it fits very well with what we're talking about here.
[03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:03.240]   Because of the early Mike Menzer training,
[03:08:03.240 --> 03:08:05.960]   or the influence, I should say,
[03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:09.160]   I've tended to train to failure purposefully
[03:08:09.160 --> 03:08:12.360]   and used to do forced reps and drop sets and all that stuff.
[03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:13.720]   As the years have gone by,
[03:08:13.720 --> 03:08:17.280]   I've started only incorporating a few sets to failure,
[03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:19.880]   and my volume has increased somewhat,
[03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:21.720]   and I'm training heavier at lower repetitions.
[03:08:21.720 --> 03:08:24.520]   And my progress as I get toward my fifth decade
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:27.440]   just continues to, just continues.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:30.680]   And so I just decided, as you were saying,
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:32.000]   in the last couple of sentences,
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:33.760]   that for the rest of the year,
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:36.400]   I'm going to not train to failure,
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:38.200]   because I really want to experience what it's like
[03:08:38.200 --> 03:08:39.800]   to do that for a long period of time,
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:42.000]   as opposed to just reducing the number of sets
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:43.160]   that I take to failure.
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:45.880]   I'm also, I'm very stringent about form
[03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:47.080]   and always have been.
[03:08:47.080 --> 03:08:50.000]   And I do want to ask what are your thoughts on,
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:51.840]   unless somebody is training for isometric
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:54.040]   or eccentric specific training,
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:55.600]   full range of motion,
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:57.360]   not just for sake of building strength,
[03:08:57.360 --> 03:08:59.600]   but can using a full range of motion
[03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:01.400]   also improve flexibility
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:03.560]   without some dedicated flexibility training?
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:04.960]   And I'd like to use this as a segue
[03:09:04.960 --> 03:09:06.520]   to talk about flexibility training.
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:07.440]   - Yes, it can.
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:10.400]   So sarcomeres can grow in length as well.
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:12.320]   So the contractile part of the muscle,
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:13.920]   they can grow lengthwise as well.
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:16.520]   It's something that needs to be done carefully
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:17.680]   and cautiously, of course.
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:20.800]   And it's with, not with heavy weights.
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:23.880]   Eventually it's possible for a person to perform,
[03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:25.920]   you know, flexibility feats with heavier weights
[03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:27.320]   if it is desirable,
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:29.240]   but initially it's something go lighter.
[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:30.640]   So yes, absolutely you can.
[03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:35.640]   And it's one of the easiest ways to promote flexibility.
[03:09:35.640 --> 03:09:40.640]   And flexibility also has a very much
[03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:43.040]   a neural component as well.
[03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:44.440]   So part of it, obviously, you know,
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.600]   you're looking at what's happening in the joints,
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:47.640]   of course.
[03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:50.240]   Part, you're looking at, you know,
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:54.480]   the length of the tissues too.
[03:09:54.480 --> 03:09:57.160]   But a lot of it is also the ability
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:01.320]   to reset the regulation of muscle length and tension.
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:04.960]   So it's like the ability to do a split, for example.
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:06.640]   It's part of it is, yeah, well,
[03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:08.520]   if you're provided your hip joints
[03:10:08.520 --> 03:10:10.240]   are built for that sort of thing,
[03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:12.120]   a lot of it is really in your mind
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:14.160]   because you're experiencing defensive inhibition.
[03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:17.400]   You're just afraid you're gonna get torn in half.
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:20.240]   So, which brings us to a very interesting parallel
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:23.400]   as we keep talking about quality
[03:10:23.400 --> 03:10:26.280]   and it's also talked about that flow channel
[03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:30.320]   by Professor Chiksuma, exactly, thank you.
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:33.280]   So between boredom and anxiety.
[03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:35.560]   So when you're trying to do a split, for example,
[03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:38.000]   so you see somebody trying to get into that stretch
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.720]   and that person goes, oh, sitting there and panicking
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:44.520]   and being in total pain and nothing is gonna happen.
[03:10:44.520 --> 03:10:48.920]   You're pretty much just facilitating this pain pathways
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:51.160]   and you're just learning to hate this exercise.
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:54.160]   A smarter individual would get to the point
[03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:56.960]   to the edge of pain and then stay there for a while
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:01.000]   and then owning it until the spindles reset.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.760]   You know, okay, accept the new range of motion.
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:06.680]   Add some contraction, relaxation, contraction, relaxation,
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:08.360]   you know, isometric stretching,
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:11.280]   you know, progress, progress even further.
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:13.320]   So in any type of training,
[03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:15.480]   forcing the adaptations is not going to work.
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:17.800]   Whether it's flexibility, whether it's strength,
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:19.160]   whether it's endurance,
[03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:21.560]   there's time for a very high level of effort,
[03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:24.760]   but there's never time for ripping yourself in half, right?
[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:27.320]   There's never time for hurting yourself on purpose.
[03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:31.480]   So, but yes, do a long range of motion work
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:33.240]   to increase range of motion.
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:34.840]   For the upper body,
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:38.840]   I'm obviously very partial towards kettlebells,
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:42.120]   but one of the great many benefits of kettlebell training,
[03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:45.880]   you know, a bow they handle, is the waist design.
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:48.480]   So you press it from here overhead,
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:51.480]   that offsets center of gravity, helps to pull your arm back.
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:53.360]   So you're just improving the shoulder flexion.
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:55.400]   You're improving thoracic extension.
[03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:57.240]   It's so much easier to place yourself
[03:11:57.240 --> 03:12:00.400]   in exactly good position and then just stay there.
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:01.920]   So it's very important to stay open,
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:04.160]   to keep that youthful posture
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:07.760]   and keep that good shoulder function.
[03:12:07.760 --> 03:12:09.200]   So, but yeah, with squats,
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:12.040]   you can definitely do that just very progressively.
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:13.920]   One warning about squats,
[03:12:13.920 --> 03:12:17.720]   if you're going for a parallel squat,
[03:12:17.720 --> 03:12:19.760]   like it is in powerlifting,
[03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:22.440]   it's parallel defined as the top of the knees
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:24.440]   a little higher than the crease on the hip.
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:27.360]   - Not a right, people will argue about this
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:30.200]   in some comical ways from time to time.
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:33.640]   So when parallel is not right angle at the knee, correct?
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:36.240]   It's parallel at the top of the thigh.
[03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:37.760]   I realize you said it very clearly,
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:40.160]   but I'm just making sure because debates abound
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:41.000]   on the internet.
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:44.200]   The top of the thigh should be parallel to the floor.
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:45.760]   - Well. - Or deeper.
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:46.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:48.600]   But when you do go for that depth
[03:12:48.600 --> 03:12:50.360]   or somewhere in that ballpark,
[03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:54.560]   you can go wide in the stance.
[03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:56.560]   You can progressively increase the width of the stance
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:12:58.320]   if you do for flexibility.
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:13:00.160]   There've been people who are doing squats
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:03.000]   like in almost like a horse stance style squats
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.880]   and progressively developing great level of flexibility.
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:07.760]   It's possible to do that.
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:11.000]   But you're doing that, you're going wider,
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:12.640]   but not necessarily deeper.
[03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:14.440]   So it's okay to go wider,
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:19.120]   but still your femur should not be dipping too much.
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:22.900]   So if you're trying to go rock bottom in the wide stance,
[03:13:22.900 --> 03:13:24.600]   your hip architecture is not designed for that.
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:25.440]   - Right.
[03:13:25.440 --> 03:13:26.840]   So like Tom Platz, right?
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:29.400]   Famous for squatting very, very deep.
[03:13:29.400 --> 03:13:31.720]   - But he was narrow, but he used the narrow stance.
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:34.000]   - Got it, so glutes on calves practically,
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:35.800]   but he was a shorter guy, right?
[03:13:35.800 --> 03:13:37.120]   - But he also, he was,
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:40.080]   but also he was also squatting in a pretty narrow stance.
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:41.240]   So in this particular case,
[03:13:41.240 --> 03:13:44.720]   you're not experiencing with the hip limitation right there.
[03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:45.820]   So it's okay for you.
[03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:47.600]   But imagine if you try to go wider
[03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:49.800]   and then you try to go, it's just, again,
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:50.960]   this is not a good idea.
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:52.840]   - You could end up on the floor, literally on the floor.
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:53.920]   - If you want to develop,
[03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:55.760]   here's a great way to develop flexibility
[03:13:55.760 --> 03:13:59.320]   for this type of rock bottom squat if you're not there yet.
[03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:01.080]   Initially been without resistance.
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:04.200]   Assume your normal squat stance.
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:05.600]   And I'm talking about a narrow stance,
[03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:07.520]   you know, shoulder width or somewhere there.
[03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:10.360]   And approach the wall, face the wall.
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:13.400]   Put your arms out and start squatting.
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:16.640]   And you will find the wall is gonna teach you.
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:19.000]   So it is the feedback from the wall.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:22.100]   If you start doing something funny with your spine,
[03:14:22.100 --> 03:14:24.920]   you're gonna hit your head on the wall and fall back.
[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:27.760]   So it's, it provides terrific feedback.
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:29.640]   It is something that I learned originally
[03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:33.680]   from a Shikun practitioner.
[03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:35.320]   And again, quite a number of skills
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:39.300]   that by system are picked up from martial arts.
[03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:41.280]   But we apply the strong first to use that
[03:14:41.280 --> 03:14:43.320]   for teaching people that upright squat
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:46.680]   and developing the mobility for deep squat.
[03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:47.800]   It's a foolproof.
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:50.840]   It's like Greg Cook would call this
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:52.320]   a self-correcting exercise.
[03:14:52.320 --> 03:14:53.880]   And those are really the best.
[03:14:53.880 --> 03:14:56.040]   When the coach can walk away and, you know,
[03:14:56.040 --> 03:14:58.080]   have a cigarette and the student
[03:14:58.080 --> 03:15:00.400]   is still gonna be able to do it right.
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:03.100]   - I love your book, "Relax Into Stretch."
[03:15:03.100 --> 03:15:05.300]   I think it's a really important concept
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:06.640]   this idea that the nervous system
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:09.520]   and our mental state is preventing,
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:13.360]   inhibiting a good amount of our natural flexibility
[03:15:13.360 --> 03:15:15.640]   that we can work with the mental state
[03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:18.520]   and progressive relaxation and contraction of muscles
[03:15:18.520 --> 03:15:20.040]   and related tissues too.
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:20.880]   - We absolutely can.
[03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:22.680]   And it's very much mind over the matter.
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:24.100]   I have a great success story.
[03:15:24.100 --> 03:15:27.520]   So one of my senior instructors,
[03:15:27.520 --> 03:15:29.480]   a strong first, Steve Freedis.
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:32.440]   So I met him a couple of decades ago
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:36.100]   and he had a severe back injury.
[03:15:36.100 --> 03:15:38.820]   So he spent eight or nine months in bed in Percocet
[03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:40.740]   and he was not athletic.
[03:15:40.740 --> 03:15:43.500]   He'd done some jogging or things like that in the past.
[03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:46.780]   And he decided to get serious about getting strong.
[03:15:46.780 --> 03:15:49.120]   So he healed up until he was healthy.
[03:15:49.120 --> 03:15:52.220]   He started lifting kettlebells.
[03:15:52.220 --> 03:15:55.020]   Then after that, he started power lifting
[03:15:55.020 --> 03:15:59.100]   and he started doing proper stretching like this.
[03:15:59.100 --> 03:16:02.220]   So he is right now, he was in his late 60s.
[03:16:02.220 --> 03:16:05.300]   He holds a bunch of American master's records
[03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:07.780]   in the deadlift, even though his back was totally messed up.
[03:16:07.780 --> 03:16:08.960]   Lifts without a belt.
[03:16:08.960 --> 03:16:11.740]   He is, you can break your fist on his abs.
[03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:12.980]   I like having people punch.
[03:16:12.980 --> 03:16:14.740]   Would you please punch, Steve?
[03:16:14.740 --> 03:16:16.080]   Just don't hurt yourself.
[03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:19.140]   But he also worked up to suspended side splits.
[03:16:19.140 --> 03:16:21.340]   And you know, that's at that point,
[03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:24.260]   he was probably in his 50s when he did that
[03:16:24.260 --> 03:16:26.620]   and maybe 60s possibly.
[03:16:26.620 --> 03:16:29.600]   And then he even competed in this crazy all around meets
[03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:33.220]   where there's one lift where you hang between two chairs
[03:16:33.220 --> 03:16:35.380]   and then you pick up a dumbbell from the ground.
[03:16:35.380 --> 03:16:37.660]   You can find the footage somewhere on the internet.
[03:16:37.660 --> 03:16:42.660]   So here's the man who did not take his injury lying down.
[03:16:42.660 --> 03:16:44.720]   So once he was cleared to train,
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:47.380]   he decided to approach his training
[03:16:47.380 --> 03:16:50.620]   with the attitude of a musician
[03:16:50.620 --> 03:16:52.700]   because he's a music professor.
[03:16:52.700 --> 03:16:55.340]   And in my experience that people
[03:16:55.340 --> 03:16:59.880]   who could become very successful and in strength,
[03:16:59.880 --> 03:17:03.880]   musicians and martial artists are among the people
[03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:05.720]   who can succeed.
[03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:08.400]   Because they're used to practice for many hours.
[03:17:08.400 --> 03:17:11.040]   They're used to paying attention to small detail
[03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:12.080]   and they're used to doing
[03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:14.880]   whatever other people consider boring over and over.
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:17.200]   So again, here is this 60 some year old man
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:18.780]   with abs you can break your hands on,
[03:17:18.780 --> 03:17:21.000]   deadlift records and full splits.
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.760]   That's what a human mind is capable of.
[03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:27.980]   - I love this concept of a practice or of practice.
[03:17:27.980 --> 03:17:30.360]   Not of a practice, but instead of training,
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:32.620]   I always thought training is such a better word
[03:17:32.620 --> 03:17:34.140]   than working out and it probably is.
[03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:38.540]   But I think practice is such a better verb than--
[03:17:38.540 --> 03:17:39.760]   - Training is also good of course.
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:44.280]   But yeah, practice is, it puts you in the right frame of mind.
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:46.780]   You imagine the word workout like Litterman quote,
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:48.800]   he literally worked himself out.
[03:17:49.780 --> 03:17:53.920]   - As long as you're highlighting remarkable instances
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:57.640]   of people in the second half of their life, let's say,
[03:17:57.640 --> 03:18:02.800]   getting quite strong, developing impressive skills.
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:04.160]   Before we started recording today,
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:06.840]   you were relaying to us that your father
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:09.160]   has acquired some significant strength.
[03:18:09.160 --> 03:18:11.800]   Could you just share some of his abilities
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:15.120]   to inspire both the people
[03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:16.840]   in the second half of their life or so
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:20.240]   and to motivate/intimidate the younger ones
[03:18:20.240 --> 03:18:23.880]   and get them going because they really have no excuse.
[03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:25.200]   - I'm very proud of my parents.
[03:18:25.200 --> 03:18:27.320]   And they're both 87 years old.
[03:18:27.320 --> 03:18:29.680]   And my father has always been an athlete.
[03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:33.960]   And then at the age of 71, I brought him to powerlifting meet
[03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:37.440]   and I see him in the warmup area picking up 225 pounds
[03:18:37.440 --> 03:18:38.280]   with bad form.
[03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:39.520]   I was like, "Dad, what are you doing?"
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:40.960]   He got interested.
[03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:45.320]   So fast forward a few years and by the time he was 75,
[03:18:45.320 --> 03:18:50.160]   he had several American records in several weight classes.
[03:18:50.160 --> 03:18:55.160]   And he deadlifted in the low 400s without a belt,
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:58.680]   body weight of 198.
[03:18:58.680 --> 03:19:03.360]   And in fact, back at that point
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:05.160]   when Professor Stuart McGill,
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:06.400]   who is a very good friend of mine,
[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:08.920]   he came to watch my dad.
[03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:12.000]   I think he pulled like three to five for a triple
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:15.000]   before a competition at Gold's Gym, Venice.
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:16.880]   And Stu examined his back
[03:19:16.880 --> 03:19:19.320]   and he said he had a muscularity in the back
[03:19:19.320 --> 03:19:20.160]   of a 40 year old.
[03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:23.000]   So I thought it was pretty, pretty, pretty cool.
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:26.560]   So he's not deadlifting right now
[03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:28.160]   because an old injury cut up to him.
[03:19:28.160 --> 03:19:30.360]   He fell off a tracked vehicle.
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:33.240]   You know, like imagine a tank without a gun,
[03:19:33.240 --> 03:19:36.040]   military tracked vehicle on ice in the winter
[03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:37.600]   and about 40 years ago.
[03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:39.400]   And there are some things that cut up to him.
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:41.400]   So he cannot deadlift right now,
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:43.880]   but he's still twice a week.
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:47.000]   He does over 50 pull-ups in total.
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.080]   And, you know, at least twice a week,
[03:19:49.080 --> 03:19:52.520]   he does over a hundred perfect body weight squats,
[03:19:52.520 --> 03:19:55.200]   like power lifting style squats, you know,
[03:19:55.200 --> 03:19:56.040]   and he does that.
[03:19:56.040 --> 03:19:58.040]   He does pushups and things like that.
[03:19:58.040 --> 03:20:00.000]   So he just stays on top of that.
[03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:02.320]   And he's still maintaining very good strength,
[03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:03.680]   very good muscularity.
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:06.640]   So the approach to building muscle for him is,
[03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:09.560]   it's that same volume with medium reps
[03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:11.000]   and a medium effort.
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:12.960]   It always works because it builds strength,
[03:20:12.960 --> 03:20:13.800]   it builds muscle.
[03:20:13.800 --> 03:20:15.320]   It's very safe.
[03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:18.000]   It's very enjoyable.
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:23.000]   And my mother, she used to be a professional ballerina
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.440]   and she got started training since she was six.
[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:27.440]   So she, because she had to train all day,
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:28.960]   she hates exercise,
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:31.720]   but she still does it because she must.
[03:20:31.720 --> 03:20:36.720]   And she came up with a great anti-glycolytic training
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:39.840]   protocol for herself.
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:41.400]   So this is something she invented.
[03:20:41.400 --> 03:20:42.560]   I had nothing to do with it,
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:45.880]   but it's just totally goes with Verkhoshansky's work.
[03:20:45.880 --> 03:20:50.800]   She climbs stairs at a high rise,
[03:20:50.800 --> 03:20:55.000]   and she will climb stairs from one floor to the next.
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:56.160]   She'll walk the hallway,
[03:20:56.160 --> 03:20:58.240]   come back and then go to the next floor.
[03:20:58.240 --> 03:21:00.560]   So that's the same idea that Verkhoshansky had.
[03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:03.720]   Intensify the intensity of contraction,
[03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:06.080]   and then give a little time to not,
[03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:08.720]   so in order to, for the acid not to pile up.
[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:10.320]   So you keep that effort,
[03:21:10.320 --> 03:21:12.920]   creating phosphate powered and aerobic powered.
[03:21:12.920 --> 03:21:15.400]   And you know, so she does it for 17 floors or whatever,
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:17.960]   a few times a week and plus other things.
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:21.520]   But yeah, I'm very fortunate, very proud of my parents.
[03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:25.120]   My father-in-law, Roger, he is a great example
[03:21:25.120 --> 03:21:27.440]   and a great grease the groove success story.
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:30.080]   So he is a retired firefighter and Marine.
[03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:34.200]   And at the age of 64, and he always lifted,
[03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:35.640]   very unusual for his generation.
[03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:39.320]   He started when he was 15 and never stopped.
[03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:43.080]   But he couldn't quite do 20 pull-ups when he was a Marine.
[03:21:43.080 --> 03:21:46.880]   So at the age of 64, he got on the grease the groove protocol.
[03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:49.360]   So at that point, his max was 10 reps.
[03:21:49.360 --> 03:21:52.040]   So I said, "Roger, every time you go by the pull-up bar,
[03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:53.760]   hit five."
[03:21:53.760 --> 03:21:55.600]   And when they become really, really easy,
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:56.920]   then you can add a rep.
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:21:58.840]   Well, a few months later, he finally,
[03:21:58.840 --> 03:22:01.440]   when he worked up to nine daily reps,
[03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:03.560]   he tested he could do 20 pull-ups.
[03:22:03.560 --> 03:22:09.040]   So at 64, he finally aced the US Marine Corps pull-up PT test,
[03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:11.560]   something that he couldn't do as a young jarhead.
[03:22:11.560 --> 03:22:13.840]   And yeah, seeing these older folks
[03:22:13.840 --> 03:22:17.480]   who are not taking their age line down
[03:22:17.480 --> 03:22:20.360]   and taking their training very seriously,
[03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:22.160]   it's just very admirable.
[03:22:22.160 --> 03:22:24.360]   And you see much younger people start complaining.
[03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:26.760]   Some 30-year-old comes, "Oh, I'm aging.
[03:22:26.760 --> 03:22:27.600]   I'm getting older.
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:28.720]   What should I do?"
[03:22:28.720 --> 03:22:31.520]   It's like, "What's wrong with your son?"
[03:22:31.520 --> 03:22:32.760]   Yeah, I completely agree.
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:35.200]   These are inspiring stories, truly inspiring,
[03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:37.480]   and people of all ages should pay attention.
[03:22:37.480 --> 03:22:40.400]   It's not done in one leap.
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:42.920]   There's the progressive nature to it.
[03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:45.880]   And I think not training to failure
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:48.840]   is resurfacing in my mind now as we have this discussion.
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:50.880]   You know, the idea isn't to grind.
[03:22:50.880 --> 03:22:53.080]   It's to just grease the groove,
[03:22:53.080 --> 03:22:55.760]   get in there and do it as a practice.
[03:22:55.760 --> 03:22:58.040]   Actually, I'm gonna change my language around this.
[03:22:58.040 --> 03:23:02.080]   I realized that when I call it a practice, as a noun,
[03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:05.000]   it's not as effective as practice, as a verb.
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.640]   I'm going to practice, just for me.
[03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:09.200]   This is just my own internal thing.
[03:23:09.200 --> 03:23:10.920]   My neuroses insist that I share this.
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:13.600]   But I do think that semantics are important,
[03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:14.680]   as you pointed out before,
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:19.400]   because it has a lot to do with how we feel about ourselves
[03:23:19.400 --> 03:23:22.360]   and what we think we're capable of.
[03:23:22.360 --> 03:23:24.680]   It starts with being inspired to try something,
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:26.400]   but also, like I didn't grow up
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:28.240]   in a particularly athletic family.
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:32.080]   None of us are unathletic,
[03:23:32.080 --> 03:23:35.720]   but I didn't think I could be, you know,
[03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:37.920]   reasonably strong, have decent endurance,
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:40.240]   and I wouldn't consider myself an athlete by any stretch,
[03:23:40.240 --> 03:23:41.560]   but-
[03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:42.520]   - You're being too modest.
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:45.480]   - But my consistency, I have confidence in.
[03:23:45.480 --> 03:23:46.960]   Like, if I bite down into something,
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:47.800]   there's a good chance I'm gonna do it
[03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:49.240]   for the next 30 years.
[03:23:49.240 --> 03:23:54.240]   - Well, in consistency, my friend, Jim Wright, who passed,
[03:23:54.240 --> 03:23:57.800]   he used to say, "Consistency over intensity."
[03:23:57.800 --> 03:23:59.520]   And that's absolutely true.
[03:23:59.520 --> 03:24:03.440]   If you're doing things correctly with proper form,
[03:24:03.440 --> 03:24:06.880]   if you do it over and over, you will win over long-term.
[03:24:06.880 --> 03:24:08.520]   Which also, interesting, kind of brings me
[03:24:08.520 --> 03:24:09.560]   to an interesting point.
[03:24:09.560 --> 03:24:12.400]   You made me think of the long-term development,
[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:13.800]   athletic development.
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:15.920]   Here's what I'd like to see in an ideal, perfect world.
[03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:17.280]   Nobody has tried that yet.
[03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:21.160]   But I imagine a strength athlete starting out
[03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:23.760]   using the Soviet system.
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:25.800]   And later, by the way, the Russian powerlifting team
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:27.920]   uses exactly the same training methodology
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:29.120]   derived from that.
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:30.720]   Which means you're training many times a week,
[03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:32.480]   let's say a squad of four or five days a week,
[03:24:32.480 --> 03:24:37.200]   and you're doing a lot of reps with this moderate effort.
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:40.720]   And you do this for years, and you achieve high level.
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:42.280]   And then at some point, you switch
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:44.480]   to this American powerlifting system,
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:46.880]   because your skills are already fully honed,
[03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:49.600]   and you're fully adapted to the type of stimulus
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:52.400]   that first system brings.
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:57.320]   And you switch to this once-a-week cycling method.
[03:24:57.320 --> 03:25:01.000]   It'll be very interesting to see what would happen,
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:02.880]   how far one could go.
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:05.720]   - So folks in your 20s and 30s, get going on it now,
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:08.240]   and we'll have a podcast in a couple of decades
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:09.800]   to check back. - That's right.
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:12.320]   - Send us a note or put in the comments.
[03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:14.640]   I'd love to talk about body weight training.
[03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:17.120]   I love, love, love the book "Naked Warrior."
[03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:18.320]   - Thank you.
[03:25:18.320 --> 03:25:21.760]   - I got that book initially because in the early days
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:24.360]   of starting my laboratory, I was traveling a ton,
[03:25:24.360 --> 03:25:26.200]   and I didn't always have access to gyms.
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:29.000]   And I wanted to try and grease the groove
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:30.880]   when I arrived in my room in the middle of the night
[03:25:30.880 --> 03:25:31.960]   in Germany or whatever.
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:35.920]   So I still have not succeeded
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:39.360]   in doing pistol squats on both legs.
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:43.520]   So one is I have some dominant and weakness, as it were,
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:48.520]   but I, without any natural strength ability to speak of,
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:52.800]   was able to learn one-arm push-ups, one-arm pull-ups.
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:53.640]   I'm not there now.
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:56.640]   I have to return to that level of upper body strength,
[03:25:56.640 --> 03:25:59.560]   but it's remarkable what one can do
[03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:00.880]   with body weight training.
[03:26:00.880 --> 03:26:03.560]   And you describe some really beautiful progressions
[03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:04.400]   in the book.
[03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:05.680]   I highly recommend this book, folks.
[03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:06.880]   - Thank you.
[03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:09.360]   - So maybe we could just take the push-up as an example
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:13.240]   and a handstand push-up as the extreme of that, right?
[03:26:13.240 --> 03:26:16.520]   What I love so much about that book is, for instance,
[03:26:16.520 --> 03:26:19.200]   you talk about doing a push-up against a wall
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:21.800]   is trivially easy for most people.
[03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:24.960]   Doing a handstand push-up free, free-standing,
[03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:25.920]   very difficult.
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:29.520]   But there's a series of progressions in between
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:31.320]   that maybe you could describe to us
[03:26:31.320 --> 03:26:33.040]   that once you realize that,
[03:26:33.040 --> 03:26:34.820]   oh, I can work through this over time,
[03:26:34.820 --> 03:26:36.800]   and if I'm not in a rush to get through it
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:39.280]   and I just do these a few times a week or more,
[03:26:39.280 --> 03:26:42.800]   ah, or a few times a day, a few times a week or more,
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:45.440]   I could do a handstand push-up free-standing
[03:26:45.440 --> 03:26:48.040]   or a pistol squat or a one-arm push-up
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:49.120]   or a one-arm pull-up.
[03:26:49.120 --> 03:26:51.920]   It's not outside one's reach at all.
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:52.760]   - Absolutely.
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:54.280]   - Yeah, so could you fill in some of the gaps?
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:57.120]   So getting people to think about the kind of physics of this
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:26:58.480]   and the principles behind it,
[03:26:58.480 --> 03:27:03.480]   it's such a valuable system and one that is a lot of fun too.
[03:27:03.480 --> 03:27:05.000]   - Before talking about the system, Andrew,
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.280]   may I speak about the relative benefits
[03:27:07.280 --> 03:27:08.840]   of different types of resistance?
[03:27:08.840 --> 03:27:10.240]   - Please. - Okay.
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:11.920]   So the body weight resistance,
[03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:16.160]   I'm gonna talk about body weight, kettlebells, and barbells.
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:17.560]   And obviously there are other things as well,
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:19.600]   but it's gonna take too long.
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:22.440]   So body weight training,
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:26.280]   the great advantage of body weight is its accessibility.
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:29.120]   So you can do a push-up absolutely anywhere.
[03:27:29.120 --> 03:27:31.880]   So that's a really huge selling point
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:33.000]   because for some people,
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.240]   somebody who travels all the time
[03:27:35.240 --> 03:27:38.280]   and somebody who's in places where gyms are not available,
[03:27:38.280 --> 03:27:40.120]   so that's a great asset.
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:44.480]   Some people just simply enjoy it greatly, that's just fine.
[03:27:44.480 --> 03:27:48.040]   The downside of body weight training is
[03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:51.600]   it's a lot harder to learn these skills
[03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:54.720]   than it is, let's say, to learn some,
[03:27:54.720 --> 03:27:57.960]   many kettlebell skills or even some barbell skills.
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:00.360]   So it seems very innocent and so easy,
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:04.800]   but it may take time to really get some of this.
[03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:07.440]   So that may take time to do it longer.
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:09.800]   It might take a longer time.
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:14.800]   The beautiful thing about the barbell is,
[03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:16.640]   well, first of all,
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:18.720]   the satisfaction of lifting really heavy stuff.
[03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:21.240]   Some people find it extremely satisfying.
[03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:22.520]   If you don't, maybe it's not for you,
[03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:24.640]   but if you do, it's incredible.
[03:28:24.640 --> 03:28:29.320]   Then the ability to adjust the weights in small increments.
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:33.680]   So you can prescribe 87.5% one rep max and you can do that.
[03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:35.000]   You cannot do that with body weight.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:36.400]   In fact, with body weight,
[03:28:36.400 --> 03:28:38.240]   it's very hard to calibrate resistance.
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:39.920]   That's another one of the problems
[03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:42.160]   because you do need to have some skills,
[03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:44.040]   figure out the regressions and progressions,
[03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:44.880]   how to do that.
[03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:47.560]   And the other thing,
[03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:51.600]   the other great benefit of the barbell is
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:54.720]   some of the lifts, especially the three power lifts,
[03:28:54.720 --> 03:28:57.960]   allow you to make great gains in strength.
[03:28:57.960 --> 03:29:00.560]   And if you choose muscle mass with a very low volume,
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:05.000]   it's possible to do three sets of five
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.800]   once a week in the squat and get very strong.
[03:29:07.800 --> 03:29:10.920]   Try to do that with pistols, it's just not gonna happen.
[03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:13.440]   So reasons for that, we can speculate.
[03:29:13.440 --> 03:29:15.120]   We know some reasons, we don't know others,
[03:29:15.120 --> 03:29:16.440]   but it is what it is.
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:22.840]   The beauty of the kettlebell for strength specifically
[03:29:22.840 --> 03:29:26.040]   is it's very easy to teach the body language
[03:29:26.040 --> 03:29:27.760]   of strength of the kettlebell.
[03:29:27.760 --> 03:29:30.280]   You will think that with a body weight,
[03:29:30.280 --> 03:29:32.280]   it should be easier because a lot of the skills
[03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:35.640]   that I teach in my book, "The Naked Warrior,"
[03:29:35.640 --> 03:29:37.920]   they are either gymnastics or martial arts based.
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:39.600]   So it's like, okay, here's the hollow position
[03:29:39.600 --> 03:29:42.320]   from gymnastics, or here's this little trick
[03:29:42.320 --> 03:29:45.360]   from hard style martial arts.
[03:29:45.360 --> 03:29:47.520]   So they're all, both use body weight.
[03:29:47.520 --> 03:29:50.560]   Nevertheless, it takes a lot more processing
[03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:52.480]   to figure out how to do this right from scratch,
[03:29:52.480 --> 03:29:55.600]   like especially contracting your abs properly,
[03:29:55.600 --> 03:29:57.920]   especially if you don't have abs to start with.
[03:29:57.920 --> 03:29:59.360]   By the time you have them, that's good.
[03:29:59.360 --> 03:30:01.480]   But if you don't have them, it's hard.
[03:30:01.480 --> 03:30:04.080]   With a kettlebell, for example, you take,
[03:30:04.080 --> 03:30:07.080]   you start doing double front squats
[03:30:07.080 --> 03:30:09.080]   with a pair of kettlebells.
[03:30:09.080 --> 03:30:10.560]   It's gonna be like zurchers.
[03:30:10.560 --> 03:30:12.440]   Your abdominal wall is gonna light up.
[03:30:12.440 --> 03:30:13.680]   You suddenly learn exactly,
[03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:16.640]   oh, this is what it means to get tight.
[03:30:16.640 --> 03:30:18.360]   Or you stick your elbows inside the knees
[03:30:18.360 --> 03:30:19.320]   and do a goblet squat.
[03:30:19.320 --> 03:30:22.760]   Oh, this is what the proper squat feels like.
[03:30:22.760 --> 03:30:27.760]   And just very easy to integrate all your body in one lift.
[03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:36.200]   And there is an apparent disadvantage of the kettlebell,
[03:30:36.200 --> 03:30:39.160]   which also can be an advantage.
[03:30:39.160 --> 03:30:42.440]   There is no, you can't program 87 1/2% body weight.
[03:30:42.440 --> 03:30:44.080]   I mean, one rep max.
[03:30:44.080 --> 03:30:46.640]   Because kettlebells jump in large,
[03:30:46.640 --> 03:30:50.560]   like for example, from 53 to 70 pounds, for example.
[03:30:50.560 --> 03:30:52.240]   That's a big jump.
[03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:55.120]   And I mean, these days, some companies
[03:30:55.120 --> 03:30:59.200]   will manufacture kettlebells with small jumps.
[03:30:59.200 --> 03:31:00.040]   What's the point?
[03:31:00.040 --> 03:31:04.160]   You're defeating some of the reasons for the being
[03:31:04.160 --> 03:31:06.920]   for this particular piece of equipment.
[03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:09.240]   And here's what they are.
[03:31:09.240 --> 03:31:11.080]   One is simplicity.
[03:31:11.080 --> 03:31:13.880]   You only can have a couple of bells and do a lot of things.
[03:31:13.880 --> 03:31:18.440]   But the other is when you go,
[03:31:18.440 --> 03:31:20.880]   when you suddenly, let's say that you've been pressing
[03:31:20.880 --> 03:31:25.240]   a 53-pound kettlebell, and you're doing a lot of sets,
[03:31:25.240 --> 03:31:27.880]   and your goal is to press a 70-pound kettlebell,
[03:31:27.880 --> 03:31:29.600]   that's a big jump.
[03:31:29.600 --> 03:31:32.920]   So what you're going to do is, first of all,
[03:31:32.920 --> 03:31:36.360]   you're gonna have to put in a very significant volume
[03:31:36.360 --> 03:31:39.720]   of work, that foundation of the pyramid.
[03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:43.800]   Many strength authors throughout history,
[03:31:43.800 --> 03:31:46.280]   Bill Starr and many others, use that analogy of volume
[03:31:46.280 --> 03:31:49.160]   as being the foundation of the pyramid.
[03:31:49.160 --> 03:31:52.560]   You're gonna have to press that 24 kilo many times properly
[03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:55.440]   before you're going to have a run at 70.
[03:31:55.440 --> 03:31:57.440]   You have to develop the confidence.
[03:31:57.440 --> 03:31:59.480]   The other thing is, you're gonna have to acquire
[03:31:59.480 --> 03:32:02.680]   the skill of tension, total body tension.
[03:32:02.680 --> 03:32:04.320]   Everything is linked up.
[03:32:04.320 --> 03:32:06.160]   Because when you go up a couple of pounds,
[03:32:06.160 --> 03:32:07.040]   it doesn't make a difference.
[03:32:07.040 --> 03:32:07.880]   You're doing the same thing.
[03:32:07.880 --> 03:32:08.960]   You're not noticing.
[03:32:08.960 --> 03:32:11.800]   When you go up a lot, everything has to be just so.
[03:32:11.800 --> 03:32:14.920]   So as you're doing, going through your sets of five
[03:32:14.920 --> 03:32:18.080]   with a 53-pounder, you're also doing just cleans
[03:32:18.080 --> 03:32:19.040]   with a 70-pounder.
[03:32:19.040 --> 03:32:21.280]   You're starting to see what it feels like.
[03:32:21.280 --> 03:32:22.360]   You're doing get-ups with it.
[03:32:22.360 --> 03:32:23.720]   You're starting to see, acquiring,
[03:32:23.720 --> 03:32:25.200]   see what that weight feels like.
[03:32:25.200 --> 03:32:27.240]   Again, we're talking about disinhibition here.
[03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:29.320]   You're planning and owing this weight.
[03:32:29.320 --> 03:32:33.040]   So you're forced to put in a very significant volume
[03:32:33.040 --> 03:32:35.120]   of work, which is very healthy.
[03:32:35.120 --> 03:32:37.880]   It will lead to a lot of really healthy adaptations.
[03:32:37.880 --> 03:32:39.640]   And you will force to develop the skills
[03:32:39.640 --> 03:32:41.560]   to make that transition.
[03:32:41.560 --> 03:32:43.840]   And plus, you're also having that desirable difficulty.
[03:32:43.840 --> 03:32:46.920]   In skill, in learning, there is that concept
[03:32:46.920 --> 03:32:51.040]   by Robert Bjork about desirable difficulties for learning.
[03:32:51.040 --> 03:32:54.280]   If learning is very easy, if something is presented,
[03:32:54.280 --> 03:32:55.480]   you don't learn much.
[03:32:55.480 --> 03:32:57.720]   If you have to struggle, like even if you're reading something
[03:32:57.720 --> 03:33:00.040]   and the font is ineligible, ironically, you
[03:33:00.040 --> 03:33:01.520]   end up learning better.
[03:33:01.520 --> 03:33:03.720]   So this is an example of a desirable difficulty
[03:33:03.720 --> 03:33:05.640]   as you're progressing this way.
[03:33:05.640 --> 03:33:07.120]   So that is for strength.
[03:33:07.120 --> 03:33:10.400]   Obviously, kettlebell have their benefits for endurance
[03:33:10.400 --> 03:33:12.240]   and for other things as well, but just
[03:33:12.240 --> 03:33:15.120]   for adjusting the resistance.
[03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:17.440]   Oftentimes, it's just a matter of preference
[03:33:17.440 --> 03:33:19.120]   and a matter of accessibility.
[03:33:19.120 --> 03:33:21.760]   So I'm not going to say you pick this tool, you pick that tool,
[03:33:21.760 --> 03:33:23.360]   you pick the other tool.
[03:33:23.360 --> 03:33:26.400]   But if you decide to pick the body weight,
[03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:29.240]   my recommendation would be just be ready for patient
[03:33:29.240 --> 03:33:33.080]   for a long road because you have to patiently learn
[03:33:33.080 --> 03:33:36.120]   these little subtleties of micromanaging your body.
[03:33:36.120 --> 03:33:38.640]   Again, you watch the body language of gymnasts.
[03:33:38.640 --> 03:33:43.640]   You watch the Sanchin Kata in some styles of karate,
[03:33:43.640 --> 03:33:46.280]   and you'll see that amazing linking
[03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:49.040]   of the different parts of the body into the one chain,
[03:33:49.040 --> 03:33:50.920]   how the tension is used.
[03:33:50.920 --> 03:33:55.000]   So it's very rewarding, but I would
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.800]   say that's probably the most attention-demanding.
[03:33:57.800 --> 03:34:01.120]   Even though it seems so innocent and so simple and so safe,
[03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:04.000]   but it demands a lot of attention.
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.880]   But if that's your speed and if you enjoy practice,
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:09.520]   true practice, that's a great way to go.
[03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:11.800]   I haven't explored kettlebell training so much.
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:14.160]   Whenever I've tried the standard kettlebell swing,
[03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:15.760]   just kind of if there is such a thing,
[03:34:15.760 --> 03:34:18.520]   but between the legs, two-handed kettlebell swing,
[03:34:18.520 --> 03:34:21.640]   I tended to get some right side, lower back pain,
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:24.200]   medial glute thing, and I'm sure I'm not doing it correctly.
[03:34:24.200 --> 03:34:27.880]   And I wanted to learn kettlebells properly.
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:30.040]   You have an online kettlebell course?
[03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:32.680]   Yes, we do have several resources.
[03:34:32.680 --> 03:34:37.200]   So we have the book, "Kettlebell Simple and Sinister,"
[03:34:37.200 --> 03:34:38.920]   which is available on Amazon.
[03:34:38.920 --> 03:34:43.080]   We have an online course under the same name.
[03:34:43.080 --> 03:34:46.840]   We also obviously have workshops,
[03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:49.000]   live instructors that you can find locally
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:51.120]   at our website, StrongFirst.
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:52.440]   But I can tell you that, of course,
[03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:54.240]   some people are not supposed to do swings,
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:56.000]   as is true for every exercise.
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:57.320]   For example, in McGill's work,
[03:34:57.320 --> 03:34:59.280]   say some people who have problem with shear,
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:01.240]   sometimes they might have issues.
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:03.640]   But a great, great number of people,
[03:35:03.640 --> 03:35:06.600]   majority of people can do swings very successfully.
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:09.280]   We have seen some really pretty broken people
[03:35:09.280 --> 03:35:10.800]   when they're cleared to do that
[03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:13.000]   and when they're coached properly.
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:16.680]   The big issue is you have to hip hinge,
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:21.000]   not lift the kettlebell with your back or with your arms.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:23.760]   And for that, we have very, very specific progressions.
[03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:26.720]   You cannot go move beyond this until you do this.
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:29.640]   Okay, here you are doing this particular hip hinge drill
[03:35:29.640 --> 03:35:30.480]   with no weight.
[03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:32.680]   Okay, good, you got that down.
[03:35:32.680 --> 03:35:35.000]   Now you're going to do a kettlebell deadlift,
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:38.440]   which is just a sumo deadlift with a light kettlebell.
[03:35:38.440 --> 03:35:39.440]   Then you're gonna progress
[03:35:39.440 --> 03:35:42.320]   with a very particular type of swing.
[03:35:42.320 --> 03:35:43.800]   So it's about patience.
[03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:45.600]   But the benefits are really worth it.
[03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:47.440]   So what are the benefits, let's say,
[03:35:47.440 --> 03:35:51.840]   of the kettlebell swings as opposed to, or snatches?
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:54.840]   Again, snatch is more of a less democratic exercise,
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:35:56.600]   like the dips, parallel bar dips.
[03:35:56.600 --> 03:35:58.680]   Fantastic for those who can do that.
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:01.640]   But if you can't, that's too bad, but there are alternatives.
[03:36:01.640 --> 03:36:02.840]   So again, the snatch is great.
[03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:05.000]   If you cannot do snatch, you can do swing.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:10.000]   So the swing, it allows you to train power
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:12.600]   and power endurance in extremely safe manner.
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:16.760]   Because if you try to develop power
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:18.640]   in a lot of conventional ways,
[03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:21.960]   you will find like, okay, you try doing Olympic lifts.
[03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:25.360]   It's very skill-intensive trying to learn how to do that.
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:27.560]   And besides, for some athletes, it's not appropriate.
[03:36:27.560 --> 03:36:32.560]   Racking the bar and overstretching the wrist ligaments,
[03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:34.880]   like for example, for fighters, that's a case of death.
[03:36:34.880 --> 03:36:36.160]   That's a really bad idea,
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:37.800]   destabilizing the wrist in this manner.
[03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:39.920]   And for many athletes, other athletes too.
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:41.920]   You know, a pitcher doesn't want to do that,
[03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:43.320]   a baseball pitcher.
[03:36:43.320 --> 03:36:46.760]   So high, you know, then you try to do things like sprinting.
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:50.240]   Sprinter requires a lot of coaching, proper coaching,
[03:36:50.240 --> 03:36:52.160]   much more than a kettlebell swing.
[03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:54.560]   And it's very, very easy to rip a hamstring
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:55.960]   or something like that.
[03:36:55.960 --> 03:37:00.720]   So it's this kettlebell swing allows you to train power
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:03.280]   and power endurance at a very safe manner.
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:05.600]   And what's also very unique about it,
[03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:07.800]   you don't have to use a lot of weight.
[03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:10.200]   What's unique about the kettlebell and the kettlebell swing,
[03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:11.320]   another thing about the design,
[03:37:11.320 --> 03:37:13.600]   you can swing it back between your legs,
[03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:15.800]   but you don't have to let it passively swing
[03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:17.040]   between your legs.
[03:37:17.040 --> 03:37:19.080]   You can choose to accelerate it.
[03:37:19.080 --> 03:37:21.200]   This is called overspeed eccentric.
[03:37:21.200 --> 03:37:23.640]   So some years back, our colleague,
[03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:26.040]   one of our instructors, Brandon Hessler,
[03:37:26.040 --> 03:37:31.040]   he put me and several other of our colleagues instructors
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:32.320]   on the force plate.
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:35.560]   And we started doing swings with overspeed eccentric,
[03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:38.840]   which means accelerating it downwards and upwards.
[03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:41.720]   So we were using just a 53 pound bell.
[03:37:41.720 --> 03:37:44.160]   So the most experienced guys,
[03:37:44.160 --> 03:37:47.400]   we were able to generate over 10 Gs of acceleration.
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:51.560]   So basically we made that 50 pound bell weigh 500 pounds.
[03:37:51.560 --> 03:37:56.560]   But if to the listeners who know about how the tissues,
[03:37:56.560 --> 03:37:59.600]   how the passive tissues can handle the load,
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:01.680]   when the loading is really rapid,
[03:38:01.680 --> 03:38:03.880]   it's amazing how these tissues can handle it
[03:38:03.880 --> 03:38:05.240]   very, very safely.
[03:38:05.240 --> 03:38:07.240]   So you can apply tremendous amount of load.
[03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:08.440]   Of course, you don't start with that.
[03:38:08.440 --> 03:38:10.400]   That's not how you start your swings.
[03:38:10.400 --> 03:38:12.760]   So, and you can develop power endurance.
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:14.360]   So you can do a whole lot of different,
[03:38:14.360 --> 03:38:16.920]   many different sets, many sets.
[03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:18.680]   You've had Megan Kelly,
[03:38:18.680 --> 03:38:21.720]   one of our certified instructors out of UK.
[03:38:21.720 --> 03:38:23.240]   You know, she set a Guinness world record
[03:38:23.240 --> 03:38:26.780]   for a crazy number of swings done in an hour.
[03:38:26.780 --> 03:38:29.360]   And so she would just go, her training is,
[03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:30.980]   she would go and do swings.
[03:38:30.980 --> 03:38:33.960]   She'll do a few reps, pick up, set it down.
[03:38:33.960 --> 03:38:36.080]   And she would do it for, let's say, 90 minutes.
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:38.000]   Then she would do it with a heavy kettlebell.
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:41.040]   And the adaptations are fantastic from that.
[03:38:41.040 --> 03:38:42.760]   In the kettlebell world,
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:44.720]   we refer to what the hell effect.
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:46.280]   So what's the hell effect?
[03:38:46.280 --> 03:38:49.400]   What the hell effect is when you're getting an adaptation,
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:50.800]   that's not a beginner's gain,
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:52.960]   but it's an adaptation that's totally unexpected.
[03:38:52.960 --> 03:38:54.360]   There's some collateral benefit,
[03:38:54.360 --> 03:38:58.120]   how suddenly you're able to do something.
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:01.780]   And the improvements in path loss,
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:03.720]   improvements in resilience.
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:06.400]   So like, for example, speaking of resilience,
[03:39:06.400 --> 03:39:08.120]   so some of the tactical teams
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:09.640]   that I worked with in the US here,
[03:39:09.640 --> 03:39:12.120]   when they added either swings or snatches
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:14.320]   to their training with the kettlebell,
[03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:17.560]   plus one-legged kettlebell deadlifts as well,
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:19.540]   they stopped tearing their hamstrings.
[03:39:19.540 --> 03:39:23.220]   So you have this amazing way to do eccentric loading
[03:39:23.220 --> 03:39:24.740]   for the hamstring, but it's very safe
[03:39:24.740 --> 03:39:26.720]   and just really prepares you.
[03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:29.280]   One of my friends who's still playing baseball in the 60s,
[03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:31.000]   he says, thank you for the kettlebells.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:32.800]   You know, he went through the course
[03:39:32.800 --> 03:39:34.680]   in one of the federal agencies 20 years ago,
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:35.640]   and he's still doing that.
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:38.580]   He's retired, but he's still doing that.
[03:39:38.580 --> 03:39:40.120]   So that's a great benefit.
[03:39:40.120 --> 03:39:43.240]   The amount of pure workload that you can do in this amount,
[03:39:43.240 --> 03:39:44.920]   that's why you can burn a lot of calories,
[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:48.020]   you can develop cardio, whatever.
[03:39:48.020 --> 03:39:52.280]   But also, like, why would anybody want to do power training
[03:39:52.280 --> 03:39:53.800]   who's not a power athlete?
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:56.840]   Because for so many reasons right now,
[03:39:56.840 --> 03:39:59.960]   I don't need to speak about it or your other guests have,
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:01.240]   for the reasons of longevity,
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:05.040]   how important it is to have high levels of power.
[03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:08.680]   And the kettlebell swing is one of the ways
[03:40:08.680 --> 03:40:09.780]   to develop it.
[03:40:09.780 --> 03:40:13.880]   And interestingly enough, going back,
[03:40:13.880 --> 03:40:16.200]   like, you know, these accelerations,
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:21.240]   Professor Nikolai Yakovlev, top Soviet biochemist,
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:25.280]   he was just talking about sprints during, added sprints,
[03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:27.200]   when you were adding sprints just to a jog,
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:28.880]   you know, this kind of a fart-like work,
[03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:30.120]   he was saying how important,
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:33.160]   how good it is for elderly and for teenagers,
[03:40:33.160 --> 03:40:34.080]   how good it is.
[03:40:34.080 --> 03:40:35.880]   So the kettlebell, even if you're not sprinting,
[03:40:35.880 --> 03:40:37.400]   if you don't know how to sprint,
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:41.360]   you're able to get so many of this youth-promoting benefits.
[03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:42.560]   And again, you have one tool
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:43.780]   that can train all the qualities.
[03:40:43.780 --> 03:40:45.880]   You can develop mobility.
[03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:48.440]   You know, the bent press, that's a tremendous exercise.
[03:40:48.440 --> 03:40:52.060]   The bent press, where the mobility of the T-spine,
[03:40:52.060 --> 03:40:55.440]   the mobility of the shoulder.
[03:40:55.440 --> 03:40:59.460]   So like you wore a watch, and watch, for example,
[03:40:59.460 --> 03:41:03.480]   Dr. Pope Mosley, he's one of our instructors,
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:07.000]   and he's also a doctor and biomed researcher.
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:09.400]   I mean, the gentleman is 70 years old,
[03:41:09.400 --> 03:41:11.600]   and he's doing these beautiful bent presses,
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:13.240]   getting himself in the range of motion
[03:41:13.240 --> 03:41:15.660]   that young guys, you know, on their phones
[03:41:15.660 --> 03:41:17.560]   can't possibly get into,
[03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:19.420]   and he's doing it in a healthy manner.
[03:41:19.420 --> 03:41:22.240]   So you can develop mobility, you can develop strength,
[03:41:22.240 --> 03:41:24.880]   you can develop endurance and resilience
[03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:26.640]   in all one package.
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:27.740]   So obviously I'm biased,
[03:41:27.740 --> 03:41:30.160]   and I'm not saying it's the only way to go,
[03:41:30.160 --> 03:41:32.720]   but that's one relative benefit,
[03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:35.520]   one of the many relative benefits of kettlebells.
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:37.680]   But an overall lifelong journey,
[03:41:37.680 --> 03:41:39.360]   like if you're looking at three things right now,
[03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:42.440]   you're new to strength, what should I start with?
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:43.820]   I would say start with the kettlebell.
[03:41:43.820 --> 03:41:45.520]   It's the best entry point.
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:49.160]   We find it so easy to start coaching people in powerlifting
[03:41:49.160 --> 03:41:51.080]   or transition to some body weight strength
[03:41:51.080 --> 03:41:53.320]   after training them with kettlebells.
[03:41:53.320 --> 03:41:54.880]   It's extremely easy,
[03:41:54.880 --> 03:41:56.960]   because they get that body weight language
[03:41:56.960 --> 03:41:58.000]   of strength down.
[03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:01.180]   - I'm gonna have a few questions
[03:42:01.180 --> 03:42:02.860]   in the upcoming months about kettlebells.
[03:42:02.860 --> 03:42:04.500]   I'll try not to bother you too many times,
[03:42:04.500 --> 03:42:06.500]   but I'll- - I'll be happy to answer them.
[03:42:06.500 --> 03:42:08.180]   - Thank you, I'll use the course as a guide,
[03:42:08.180 --> 03:42:11.380]   but I'm determined to derive some of these benefits
[03:42:11.380 --> 03:42:15.180]   of kettlebells, because kettlebells have been around me
[03:42:15.180 --> 03:42:17.740]   for over a decade now,
[03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:19.940]   and I just haven't quite taken to them,
[03:42:19.940 --> 03:42:21.060]   not through some aversion,
[03:42:21.060 --> 03:42:22.460]   but I'm gonna approach it correctly.
[03:42:22.460 --> 03:42:24.580]   I love the body weight work.
[03:42:24.580 --> 03:42:26.880]   The body weight work, I don't know,
[03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:29.140]   maybe it takes me back to PE class
[03:42:29.140 --> 03:42:30.460]   when I was in high school or something,
[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:33.620]   when we do these fit tests.
[03:42:33.620 --> 03:42:35.220]   It's usually some pull-ups and push-ups,
[03:42:35.220 --> 03:42:37.300]   a reach and a run or something like that,
[03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:40.460]   like a straight-legged toe reach,
[03:42:40.460 --> 03:42:42.080]   who knows if it's a meaningful metric,
[03:42:42.080 --> 03:42:45.220]   but in any case, something so satisfying
[03:42:45.220 --> 03:42:48.180]   about going from struggling with push-ups
[03:42:48.180 --> 03:42:50.060]   to being able to do a one-arm push-up
[03:42:50.060 --> 03:42:51.700]   or something like that.
[03:42:51.700 --> 03:42:54.060]   And you describe it in how to make that progression
[03:42:54.060 --> 03:42:54.980]   in the book.
[03:42:54.980 --> 03:42:56.700]   For people that are- - If I may just interrupt you,
[03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:58.500]   and it's also cool that you're a bigger guy
[03:42:58.500 --> 03:42:59.380]   and you're doing that.
[03:42:59.380 --> 03:43:00.420]   This is what I love to see,
[03:43:00.420 --> 03:43:02.540]   and we're seeing that as strong first a lot.
[03:43:02.540 --> 03:43:05.740]   We'll have to see bigger guys and gals
[03:43:05.740 --> 03:43:08.220]   getting into the body weight exercises,
[03:43:08.220 --> 03:43:11.100]   because that's not typical of their strength.
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:14.220]   We like to see skinny people getting into the barbell
[03:43:14.220 --> 03:43:15.460]   and just go against it.
[03:43:15.460 --> 03:43:18.580]   For example, seeing somebody like Dr. Mike Hartle,
[03:43:18.580 --> 03:43:20.220]   one of our master instructors,
[03:43:20.220 --> 03:43:23.520]   he's a former American bench press record holder
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:26.060]   and coach for the powerlifting team USA.
[03:43:26.060 --> 03:43:28.020]   I mean, watching him do one-arm push-ups,
[03:43:28.020 --> 03:43:28.900]   you gotta love that stuff,
[03:43:28.900 --> 03:43:31.460]   because normally big guys hate body weight work.
[03:43:31.460 --> 03:43:34.300]   - It's humbling. - And little guys hate barbell.
[03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:37.220]   And we just get, and not just guys, women.
[03:43:37.220 --> 03:43:38.780]   We have these ladies,
[03:43:38.780 --> 03:43:41.940]   these skinny little ladies lifting amazing weights.
[03:43:41.940 --> 03:43:43.740]   That's just always awesome to see that.
[03:43:43.740 --> 03:43:44.880]   - It is awesome.
[03:43:44.880 --> 03:43:46.900]   And I love that strength training,
[03:43:46.900 --> 03:43:50.020]   resistance training is starting to really make a showing
[03:43:50.020 --> 03:43:51.660]   here in the US and the general public.
[03:43:51.660 --> 03:43:53.540]   I think it's one of the best things to happen
[03:43:53.540 --> 03:43:54.380]   in the last few years.
[03:43:54.380 --> 03:43:56.420]   And this discussion,
[03:43:56.420 --> 03:43:58.820]   your knowledge is gonna put even more momentum behind.
[03:43:58.820 --> 03:44:01.580]   - If I just made to guide people just briefly
[03:44:01.580 --> 03:44:02.940]   on a very high level,
[03:44:02.940 --> 03:44:06.180]   great news, you have so many choices.
[03:44:06.180 --> 03:44:08.260]   Bad news, you have too many choices.
[03:44:08.260 --> 03:44:12.060]   So pick one program with an established track record
[03:44:12.060 --> 03:44:14.700]   and just stick with it and follow it for a long time.
[03:44:14.700 --> 03:44:17.620]   Do not try to over-customize everything.
[03:44:17.620 --> 03:44:20.660]   Daniel Kahneman spoke how much algorithms
[03:44:20.660 --> 03:44:22.660]   outperform humans so often.
[03:44:22.660 --> 03:44:23.900]   I've seen this over and over
[03:44:23.900 --> 03:44:26.500]   how a properly designed strength program
[03:44:26.500 --> 03:44:31.500]   or endurance program that was generic design,
[03:44:31.500 --> 03:44:35.260]   but with certain feedback loops in there.
[03:44:35.260 --> 03:44:36.100]   Okay, if this happens,
[03:44:36.100 --> 03:44:38.540]   you have to go back and make some changes.
[03:44:38.540 --> 03:44:40.140]   Deliver much better results
[03:44:40.140 --> 03:44:41.820]   on customized programs very often.
[03:44:41.820 --> 03:44:44.780]   So find something that's simple,
[03:44:44.780 --> 03:44:47.940]   find something that does not have a lot of moving parts
[03:44:47.940 --> 03:44:50.920]   and just stick with this for a long time if it's working.
[03:44:50.920 --> 03:44:52.960]   Do not look for the next thing
[03:44:52.960 --> 03:44:56.960]   because the next thing, maybe it's as good, maybe not.
[03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:01.000]   But also do keep in mind that every time you change gears,
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:02.000]   you lose momentum.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:06.680]   You know, you're a neuroscientist.
[03:45:06.680 --> 03:45:08.600]   I don't know if you spoke to your audience
[03:45:08.600 --> 03:45:10.740]   about the law of neural Darwinism,
[03:45:10.740 --> 03:45:14.700]   but there's a competition between the synaptic sites.
[03:45:14.700 --> 03:45:16.360]   So you have the pathways.
[03:45:16.360 --> 03:45:19.400]   So you can only do so many things well.
[03:45:19.400 --> 03:45:22.360]   So a child can do everything, but poorly.
[03:45:22.360 --> 03:45:26.800]   But as we get older, some of these pathways get pruned,
[03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:29.080]   but others get reinforced.
[03:45:29.080 --> 03:45:32.320]   And unfortunately we can't excel at everything.
[03:45:32.320 --> 03:45:35.240]   So there's this classic example with,
[03:45:35.240 --> 03:45:37.300]   and not just physically, mentally as well,
[03:45:37.300 --> 03:45:38.840]   cognitively as well,
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:42.400]   this classic example with taxi drivers.
[03:45:42.400 --> 03:45:47.080]   Back in the days before GPS, taxi cab drivers,
[03:45:47.080 --> 03:45:49.600]   they were supposed to pass an extremely challenging test,
[03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:51.560]   how to navigate through the city
[03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:54.640]   that was not designed to be navigated through.
[03:45:54.640 --> 03:45:59.640]   And they found that a certain part of their hippocampus
[03:45:59.640 --> 03:46:03.640]   was more developed than in others.
[03:46:03.640 --> 03:46:05.240]   And so this, you know, so they thought,
[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:07.480]   well, maybe it's just pre-selection.
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:09.640]   Maybe whoever made it through the test
[03:46:09.640 --> 03:46:12.920]   were the guys with the more muscular hippocampi, you know.
[03:46:12.920 --> 03:46:14.520]   And then they monitored,
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:17.120]   then they monitored two groups of students
[03:46:17.120 --> 03:46:18.080]   over several years.
[03:46:18.080 --> 03:46:20.120]   And they said they started with the same size.
[03:46:20.120 --> 03:46:22.720]   And in the group that passed,
[03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:24.920]   their brains, so to say, got bigger in that part,
[03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:26.720]   and the others, they didn't, okay.
[03:46:26.720 --> 03:46:27.840]   But then at the same time,
[03:46:27.840 --> 03:46:30.360]   in a different test of a different test of memory,
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:33.640]   the guys who passed the test, they were not so good.
[03:46:33.640 --> 03:46:36.120]   So they lost something in the process.
[03:46:36.120 --> 03:46:37.120]   It's just life.
[03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:40.760]   It's many things in life are zero-sum game.
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:44.560]   You want to seek some balance up to a point,
[03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:45.880]   but there comes a point where, you know,
[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:46.760]   you cannot do it all.
[03:46:46.760 --> 03:46:48.200]   We are limited in time.
[03:46:48.200 --> 03:46:50.680]   We're limited in our adaptive capacity.
[03:46:50.680 --> 03:46:51.720]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[03:46:51.720 --> 03:46:53.160]   And I appreciate you highlighting
[03:46:53.160 --> 03:46:56.080]   the London cab drivers experiment.
[03:46:56.080 --> 03:46:58.360]   Your knowledge of neuroscience is truly impressive.
[03:46:58.360 --> 03:46:59.400]   - You're way too generous, thank you.
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:00.760]   - No, it's true.
[03:47:00.760 --> 03:47:04.020]   No other guest on here has discussed long-term depression,
[03:47:04.020 --> 03:47:05.760]   which it's-
[03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:07.200]   - My dad said, Andrew, you know something
[03:47:07.200 --> 03:47:08.800]   my dad taught me early on,
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:12.560]   that is good things happen at junctions of fields.
[03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:16.140]   If you're always stay exactly just in your own narrow field,
[03:47:16.140 --> 03:47:17.440]   and you're just, you know,
[03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:19.480]   it's just the same thing is repeated.
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:21.520]   But when you start going to somewhere else
[03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:22.840]   a little bit outside, it's adjacent,
[03:47:22.840 --> 03:47:25.720]   whether it's neuroscience, whether it's, okay,
[03:47:25.720 --> 03:47:28.480]   how do they, you know, what are the martial arts skills?
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:30.440]   How do the martial artists do for striking
[03:47:30.440 --> 03:47:31.280]   or somewhere else?
[03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:32.600]   I think that just really interesting
[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:34.760]   to kind of a step a little bit outside your comfort zone.
[03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:37.720]   And sometimes you see patterns, that's what happens.
[03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:39.760]   - Your father's a smart, smart man.
[03:47:39.760 --> 03:47:41.000]   - Thank you.
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:43.400]   - Kids and young people training.
[03:47:43.400 --> 03:47:45.240]   I don't know what the going word is now
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:48.100]   as to whether or not there's a, you know,
[03:47:48.100 --> 03:47:50.780]   too young to what to resistance train age.
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:52.860]   You know, some people say there isn't.
[03:47:52.860 --> 03:47:54.620]   When I was growing up,
[03:47:54.620 --> 03:47:56.460]   it was thought that if you squatted heavy
[03:47:56.460 --> 03:47:57.580]   or you deadlifted heavy
[03:47:57.580 --> 03:48:02.180]   before you reached your natural limits of your height,
[03:48:02.180 --> 03:48:04.660]   that it could, quote unquote, stunt your growth.
[03:48:04.660 --> 03:48:05.660]   Like your comments on that.
[03:48:05.660 --> 03:48:07.700]   But based on what we were just talking about,
[03:48:07.700 --> 03:48:11.180]   it seems that if a young person is interested
[03:48:11.180 --> 03:48:14.780]   in developing a super skill in one area, one sport,
[03:48:14.780 --> 03:48:17.360]   okay, but there's a real trade-off to that.
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:19.680]   And perhaps what we should do as kids
[03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:22.960]   is a little bit of soccer, a little bit of swimming,
[03:48:22.960 --> 03:48:23.800]   a little bit of gymnastics.
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:26.340]   Gymnastics seems like a wonderful all-around sport.
[03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:27.600]   Maybe a little archery, you know,
[03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:29.520]   try a bunch of things, some ballet, you know, try it.
[03:48:29.520 --> 03:48:30.800]   - Well, that's the time to do that.
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:33.360]   That's explodes that neurodiversity
[03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:35.080]   and the things that you can possibly do
[03:48:35.080 --> 03:48:37.320]   and then find the things that you click with.
[03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:39.120]   And for the physical body,
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:42.240]   early specialization destroys athletes.
[03:48:42.240 --> 03:48:44.940]   It is really terrible because early on,
[03:48:44.940 --> 03:48:47.300]   kids absolutely need to do a wide variety
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:48.660]   of different activities
[03:48:48.660 --> 03:48:51.700]   and really pursue a fairly balanced development.
[03:48:51.700 --> 03:48:53.660]   You know, there may be a bias towards strength
[03:48:53.660 --> 03:48:54.860]   or bias towards endurance,
[03:48:54.860 --> 03:48:56.900]   but they really need to do it all.
[03:48:56.900 --> 03:49:01.500]   And specialist athletes break, they break, they really do.
[03:49:01.500 --> 03:49:04.540]   So that balance between general and specific,
[03:49:04.540 --> 03:49:05.540]   it's a tough balance.
[03:49:05.540 --> 03:49:07.340]   - Yeah, and psychologically sometimes too.
[03:49:07.340 --> 03:49:10.680]   We had a guest on here who's become a psychologist,
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:13.500]   but she was a concert level violin player
[03:49:13.500 --> 03:49:14.580]   that injured her finger.
[03:49:14.580 --> 03:49:17.500]   And it was like the most devastating thing.
[03:49:17.500 --> 03:49:20.500]   You know, when we put all of our sort of identity
[03:49:20.500 --> 03:49:24.020]   into one thing, sure, you get your Michael Jordans
[03:49:24.020 --> 03:49:26.940]   and you get your Tiger Woods's, you know, but-
[03:49:26.940 --> 03:49:29.660]   - And seriously, there is no right answer or wrong answer.
[03:49:29.660 --> 03:49:33.340]   So I remember Ivan Abadzhiev,
[03:49:33.340 --> 03:49:37.820]   who was a head coach for the Bulgarian weightlifting team.
[03:49:37.820 --> 03:49:41.720]   He says, if Paganini played whatever instruments,
[03:49:41.720 --> 03:49:45.040]   you know, in addition to his own instrument,
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:46.360]   playing in 15 hours a day,
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:48.280]   he would not have become Paganini.
[03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:51.040]   And that's true, but I'm not saying that specialization
[03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:54.160]   is necessarily the right choice for everybody.
[03:49:54.160 --> 03:49:57.880]   Some people prefer to be decent in many things
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:00.700]   and it is healthy, but you still have to decide.
[03:50:00.700 --> 03:50:01.960]   You still have to make decisions.
[03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:04.020]   Very much, you're looking like at a budget.
[03:50:04.020 --> 03:50:05.440]   Do I want to buy a couch
[03:50:05.440 --> 03:50:07.860]   or do you want to go on a vacation to Italy?
[03:50:07.860 --> 03:50:10.820]   Or do I want to go on a much lamer vacation
[03:50:10.820 --> 03:50:12.500]   and buy a lamer couch and do both?
[03:50:12.500 --> 03:50:14.880]   And I'm not saying what's the right answer right there,
[03:50:14.880 --> 03:50:16.500]   but just people do have to understand
[03:50:16.500 --> 03:50:18.580]   there are limitations.
[03:50:18.580 --> 03:50:21.060]   They can't successfully compete in two sports, for example.
[03:50:21.060 --> 03:50:21.900]   It's not going to happen,
[03:50:21.900 --> 03:50:25.320]   especially if it's a power sport and endurance sport.
[03:50:25.320 --> 03:50:29.140]   And they can't study everything to a high level
[03:50:29.140 --> 03:50:30.500]   just as well.
[03:50:30.500 --> 03:50:31.660]   If you want to be a polymath,
[03:50:31.660 --> 03:50:34.420]   that was fine in the 18th century.
[03:50:34.420 --> 03:50:35.880]   Right now, it's a little bit tougher.
[03:50:35.880 --> 03:50:37.820]   - Yeah, previous guests, you may know him,
[03:50:37.820 --> 03:50:40.600]   Josh Waitzkin of chess prodigy fame.
[03:50:40.600 --> 03:50:45.080]   He's gone on to do several things at world-class level
[03:50:45.080 --> 03:50:49.360]   by severing from the previous endeavor completely.
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:51.640]   He hasn't picked up a chess piece since he was 16,
[03:50:51.640 --> 03:50:53.920]   which is remarkable, pivoting to other things.
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:50:57.360]   But when one looks at the data on child prodigies,
[03:50:57.360 --> 03:50:58.960]   very few of them are like Josh.
[03:50:58.960 --> 03:51:02.080]   Most of them don't actually succeed in doing anything else
[03:51:02.080 --> 03:51:04.340]   at a very high level, except hopefully survive
[03:51:04.340 --> 03:51:05.540]   and thrive in their personal life.
[03:51:05.540 --> 03:51:06.380]   Who knows?
[03:51:06.380 --> 03:51:11.140]   After being ultra successful as a young child,
[03:51:11.140 --> 03:51:14.000]   probably because their nervous system is so,
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:15.880]   you know, they grease the groove so heavily
[03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:18.120]   for one endeavor, it's very hard to cross over.
[03:51:18.120 --> 03:51:20.900]   Josh is exceptional in that regard.
[03:51:20.900 --> 03:51:23.260]   - Well, exceptions prove the rule usually.
[03:51:23.260 --> 03:51:24.100]   - Exactly.
[03:51:24.100 --> 03:51:27.500]   Not to say too mechanical and specific,
[03:51:27.500 --> 03:51:31.220]   but I'd love to talk about abdominal or rather core work.
[03:51:31.220 --> 03:51:32.060]   - Sure.
[03:51:32.060 --> 03:51:34.020]   - Another thing that I love in "The Naked Warrior"
[03:51:34.020 --> 03:51:35.820]   are the abdominal exercises.
[03:51:35.820 --> 03:51:39.580]   I must tell you, after years of doing some crunches
[03:51:39.580 --> 03:51:42.400]   here and there and different, you know, for whatever,
[03:51:42.400 --> 03:51:44.620]   this class or that class or trying to,
[03:51:44.620 --> 03:51:47.700]   I never really cared about having my abs defined
[03:51:47.700 --> 03:51:49.080]   for its own sake.
[03:51:49.080 --> 03:51:52.220]   One should probably be able to at least contract their abs.
[03:51:52.220 --> 03:51:53.420]   Okay, it's the level of-
[03:51:53.420 --> 03:51:54.740]   - We assess them by punching them.
[03:51:54.740 --> 03:51:56.260]   - Right, right, right, exactly.
[03:51:56.260 --> 03:51:58.180]   But there's some wonderful exercises in there
[03:51:58.180 --> 03:52:00.240]   about learning to brace the entire body
[03:52:00.240 --> 03:52:05.240]   and some, dare I say, some rather unorthodox ways
[03:52:05.240 --> 03:52:07.700]   of assessing stability at the level of the core.
[03:52:07.700 --> 03:52:10.240]   I'm thinking about the plank where somebody tries
[03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:12.340]   to either kick you over or push you over.
[03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:13.300]   This might sound violent.
[03:52:13.300 --> 03:52:14.500]   This is not where you start, folks.
[03:52:14.500 --> 03:52:15.340]   - It's kind and gentle.
[03:52:15.340 --> 03:52:17.620]   - But I never thought I could do like hanging pikes,
[03:52:17.620 --> 03:52:18.460]   for instance.
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:21.700]   And like now pikes are standard part of my weekly routine.
[03:52:21.700 --> 03:52:24.340]   I love doing five sets of five of hanging pikes.
[03:52:24.340 --> 03:52:25.820]   - Great, great.
[03:52:25.820 --> 03:52:28.760]   - And I will tell anyone that decides to go down this path
[03:52:28.760 --> 03:52:32.320]   that when I first tried to do a pike, I failed miserably.
[03:52:32.320 --> 03:52:35.540]   I tried an L-sit, failed miserably.
[03:52:35.540 --> 03:52:38.200]   Tried the, you know, hanging from the bar
[03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:39.540]   and just getting into a chair position
[03:52:39.540 --> 03:52:40.960]   and could just barely hold that.
[03:52:40.960 --> 03:52:42.740]   The progressions are what matter, right?
[03:52:42.740 --> 03:52:44.300]   Slow progression and patience.
[03:52:44.300 --> 03:52:47.440]   Now five sets of five pikes, trivial for me.
[03:52:47.440 --> 03:52:51.060]   But when I, I just want to emphasize that when I started,
[03:52:51.060 --> 03:52:53.740]   I was far, far away from that.
[03:52:53.740 --> 03:52:56.380]   And it's the progressions in the book that really helped me
[03:52:56.380 --> 03:52:57.780]   and I've maintained that pike ability.
[03:52:57.780 --> 03:52:58.900]   So thank you for that.
[03:52:58.900 --> 03:53:02.620]   And I say it not to necessarily to highlight what I can do,
[03:53:02.620 --> 03:53:07.060]   but that to highlight what I do believe most anybody can do.
[03:53:07.060 --> 03:53:08.100]   If you put the work in.
[03:53:08.100 --> 03:53:10.240]   - If they put a lot of attention in.
[03:53:10.240 --> 03:53:14.420]   So midsection training is one of the most misunderstood
[03:53:14.420 --> 03:53:17.500]   and messed up areas of physical culture.
[03:53:17.500 --> 03:53:19.420]   There's a thousand different exercises
[03:53:19.420 --> 03:53:21.220]   and people are going, you gotta have variety,
[03:53:21.220 --> 03:53:22.560]   this many reps.
[03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:23.740]   That's not the point.
[03:53:23.740 --> 03:53:27.160]   The point really is tension and attention.
[03:53:27.160 --> 03:53:29.180]   So that's, those are the two things.
[03:53:29.180 --> 03:53:33.460]   And ideally your best first step
[03:53:33.460 --> 03:53:35.480]   is really learning abdominal tension
[03:53:35.480 --> 03:53:38.140]   through something like a Zurcher squat
[03:53:38.140 --> 03:53:40.100]   or double kettlebell front squat,
[03:53:40.100 --> 03:53:42.900]   where the load distribution is such
[03:53:42.900 --> 03:53:44.940]   that it forces reflexive stabilization.
[03:53:44.940 --> 03:53:48.700]   And you feel, oh, that's what tight abs feel like.
[03:53:48.700 --> 03:53:52.000]   And getting somebody just weak in a plank, it's hopeless.
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:53.380]   It's absolutely not going to help.
[03:53:53.380 --> 03:53:54.220]   It's not.
[03:53:54.220 --> 03:53:55.540]   There are ways of building up to it.
[03:53:55.540 --> 03:53:58.540]   Yes, by rolling in the back and so on.
[03:53:58.540 --> 03:54:00.840]   So, but if you don't have that option
[03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:03.360]   or if you choose not to exercise it,
[03:54:03.360 --> 03:54:05.640]   you have to be extremely attentive to the details
[03:54:05.640 --> 03:54:07.600]   of what's going on within your abdomen.
[03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:09.720]   So you need to learn things like, for example,
[03:54:09.720 --> 03:54:12.040]   you need to learn to contract the pelvic diaphragm,
[03:54:12.040 --> 03:54:13.360]   pull your butt up.
[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:16.040]   Because you're trying to, you know,
[03:54:16.040 --> 03:54:19.480]   trying to constrain the intra-abdominal pressure.
[03:54:19.480 --> 03:54:22.640]   Then you need to learn how to direct attention
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:24.800]   to the different parts of your abdomen,
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:27.640]   almost like a bodybuilder, but really not quite,
[03:54:27.640 --> 03:54:29.260]   more like a gymnast.
[03:54:29.260 --> 03:54:31.680]   There is this argument about, in the strength world,
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:35.400]   about internal focus, external focus and cueing.
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:37.120]   And the agreement is in motor learning,
[03:54:37.120 --> 03:54:39.120]   well, external focus cueing is so much better
[03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:41.320]   than focusing on whatever happens
[03:54:41.320 --> 03:54:43.000]   within the individual muscle.
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:44.920]   It may be true in the beginning,
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:47.540]   and it may be true outside of the strength game,
[03:54:47.540 --> 03:54:50.380]   but any top strength athlete that you will meet,
[03:54:50.380 --> 03:54:53.480]   they have their own internal cues how they do something.
[03:54:53.480 --> 03:54:54.640]   Later on, they may forget them.
[03:54:54.640 --> 03:54:56.600]   They despise them, you know, but they know how to,
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:55:01.600]   this is how I engage the lat in the bench press.
[03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:03.880]   George Halbert, bench press world record holder,
[03:55:03.880 --> 03:55:05.760]   famously said, "It took him many years
[03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:07.420]   "to finally understand how the triceps
[03:55:07.420 --> 03:55:08.800]   "is used in the bench press."
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:10.280]   Many years.
[03:55:10.280 --> 03:55:12.480]   So there is a lot of internal component,
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:14.760]   and for the abs, very, very much.
[03:55:14.760 --> 03:55:18.000]   So you have to learn how to very much
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:19.400]   direct your attention there.
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:22.720]   To get high tension, you have to keep the rep slow.
[03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:24.680]   Like you said, five sets of five, perfect.
[03:55:24.680 --> 03:55:26.520]   High reps are not necessary.
[03:55:26.520 --> 03:55:28.600]   You're not gonna burn off fat by doing more reps.
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:30.360]   You're just gonna irritate your back.
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:32.220]   That's all you're gonna do, nothing else.
[03:55:32.220 --> 03:55:34.480]   So you treat your ab training very much
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:38.120]   like a strength event.
[03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:41.160]   And if you do that, you're gonna get those results.
[03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:45.140]   And finally, the final detail is you need to use
[03:55:45.140 --> 03:55:47.580]   that intra-abdominal pressure as your friend,
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:53.200]   because in lifting like a deadlift or a squat or something,
[03:55:53.200 --> 03:55:55.520]   the intra-abdominal pressure helps you, it supports you.
[03:55:55.520 --> 03:55:57.160]   When you're doing abdominal work,
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:00.080]   you work against that intra-abdominal pressure.
[03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:02.920]   You just create that pressure and contract against it.
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:05.680]   This is something called internal isometrics.
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:07.160]   So it's kind of interesting.
[03:56:07.160 --> 03:56:10.920]   It's just a combination of a classic strength work
[03:56:10.920 --> 03:56:12.760]   with very internalized,
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:15.400]   kind of almost like a martial arts approach to it.
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:18.440]   Then you need to learn also how to obviously
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:20.760]   use your abs in the lifts, in lifting.
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:22.800]   And once you do, and this is the beauty,
[03:56:22.800 --> 03:56:25.060]   you don't really have to train your abs anymore.
[03:56:25.060 --> 03:56:28.060]   So Franco Colombo, for example, great example,
[03:56:28.060 --> 03:56:30.620]   in addition to winning, being super strong
[03:56:30.620 --> 03:56:32.720]   and winning Mr. Olympia, he won the best abs.
[03:56:32.720 --> 03:56:34.080]   He didn't train abs.
[03:56:34.080 --> 03:56:36.520]   He said, he told me, "I hate ab training."
[03:56:36.520 --> 03:56:39.720]   He just would stay tight whenever he did his heavy lifts.
[03:56:39.720 --> 03:56:41.160]   And this is pretty much what happens.
[03:56:41.160 --> 03:56:43.980]   When you reach a certain level of strength
[03:56:43.980 --> 03:56:46.200]   and a certain level of awareness,
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:49.500]   simply staying tight during your strength work
[03:56:49.500 --> 03:56:51.380]   and also employing power breathing,
[03:56:51.380 --> 03:56:52.960]   which is very important,
[03:56:52.960 --> 03:56:56.240]   you're gonna be able to get as strong as you need in the abs
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:56:58.160]   and get your six pack or whatever,
[03:56:58.160 --> 03:57:00.940]   provided you don't eat the Twinkies.
[03:57:00.940 --> 03:57:04.260]   So how do you pressurize the,
[03:57:04.260 --> 03:57:07.640]   in fact, may I show an abdominal exercise right now
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:09.120]   that is just sitting at this table
[03:57:09.120 --> 03:57:12.900]   that's also going to teach you how,
[03:57:12.900 --> 03:57:17.180]   teach your audience how to properly pressurize for lifting.
[03:57:17.180 --> 03:57:19.860]   So normally it's better done standing.
[03:57:19.860 --> 03:57:22.620]   So, and it's not for people with high blood pressure
[03:57:22.620 --> 03:57:24.580]   or heart concerns, you know, check with your doctor
[03:57:24.580 --> 03:57:26.300]   if that's the situation.
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:29.500]   So you take a normal breath in your abdomen
[03:57:29.500 --> 03:57:33.660]   and you pull up your butt pretty much.
[03:57:33.660 --> 03:57:35.580]   Like imagine you have to go to the restroom
[03:57:35.580 --> 03:57:37.560]   and you're trying to, you can't quite, you know,
[03:57:37.560 --> 03:57:40.140]   it's far away, you're trying to stop yourself.
[03:57:40.140 --> 03:57:43.060]   And then you put your tongue between your teeth
[03:57:43.060 --> 03:57:43.900]   and you start,
[03:57:43.900 --> 03:57:49.060]   and you start hissing.
[03:57:49.060 --> 03:57:52.340]   And you do this in this ratcheting kind of manner.
[03:57:52.340 --> 03:57:53.180]   So,
[03:57:53.180 --> 03:57:58.320]   try to keep all the pressure out of your head,
[03:57:58.320 --> 03:58:00.900]   out of your neck, direct all the pressure,
[03:58:00.900 --> 03:58:03.860]   all this pressure is just to really staying below.
[03:58:03.860 --> 03:58:06.080]   And so this type of hissing,
[03:58:08.180 --> 03:58:10.100]   you will notice that very rapidly
[03:58:10.100 --> 03:58:12.860]   you're going to contract everything around your waist.
[03:58:12.860 --> 03:58:15.680]   So everything around your waist is going to contract.
[03:58:15.680 --> 03:58:17.340]   And you're going to strain your abdomen.
[03:58:17.340 --> 03:58:20.380]   You're also going to start learn how to properly,
[03:58:20.380 --> 03:58:24.060]   how to properly stabilize yourself under heavy weights.
[03:58:24.060 --> 03:58:27.340]   The difference between using this technique for lifting
[03:58:27.340 --> 03:58:29.060]   and for just training the abs.
[03:58:29.060 --> 03:58:29.960]   When you're training the abs,
[03:58:29.960 --> 03:58:31.540]   there's going to be some spinal flexion.
[03:58:31.540 --> 03:58:33.560]   Not a whole lot, you don't want to do a lot of that.
[03:58:33.560 --> 03:58:36.060]   There's going to be some spinal flexion.
[03:58:36.060 --> 03:58:39.540]   When you're doing that under a heavy barbell squat,
[03:58:39.540 --> 03:58:41.380]   you're maintaining your spine is neutral.
[03:58:41.380 --> 03:58:43.260]   It's like your body stays a cylinder.
[03:58:43.260 --> 03:58:47.800]   And you're going to hold your breath pretty much.
[03:58:47.800 --> 03:58:49.100]   But the idea is the same.
[03:58:49.100 --> 03:58:49.940]   So it's like,
[03:58:49.940 --> 03:58:55.860]   so the Valsalva maneuver, one Russian coach called it,
[03:58:55.860 --> 03:59:01.300]   it's an exhalation that didn't happen.
[03:59:01.300 --> 03:59:02.140]   Okay?
[03:59:02.140 --> 03:59:03.620]   Because people don't know how to hold their breath properly.
[03:59:03.620 --> 03:59:05.020]   They just,
[03:59:05.020 --> 03:59:06.700]   and then eyes are bulging out
[03:59:06.700 --> 03:59:08.380]   where there's no stability right here.
[03:59:08.380 --> 03:59:10.940]   So first of all, you got to inhale low.
[03:59:10.940 --> 03:59:12.420]   And how do you do that?
[03:59:12.420 --> 03:59:14.700]   If you watch top lifters, how they do that,
[03:59:14.700 --> 03:59:17.460]   they will do it through pursed lips.
[03:59:17.460 --> 03:59:19.240]   You can also do it through the nose,
[03:59:19.240 --> 03:59:21.320]   but you cannot do it through big wide open mouth.
[03:59:21.320 --> 03:59:23.000]   So I'll show you why.
[03:59:23.000 --> 03:59:25.740]   So if you, you can, your folks can try it at home.
[03:59:25.740 --> 03:59:27.980]   So if you put your hand on your stomach
[03:59:27.980 --> 03:59:29.820]   and trying to do an abdominal breath,
[03:59:29.820 --> 03:59:32.860]   doesn't go very well.
[03:59:32.860 --> 03:59:35.680]   Now, for contrast, pinch off one nostril.
[03:59:35.680 --> 03:59:39.780]   Take an abdominal breath.
[03:59:39.780 --> 03:59:41.180]   Or you can do that through pursed lips.
[03:59:41.180 --> 03:59:42.020]   Try it again.
[03:59:42.020 --> 03:59:46.420]   So you see.
[03:59:46.420 --> 03:59:47.300]   - More resistance.
[03:59:47.300 --> 03:59:48.160]   - More resistance.
[03:59:48.160 --> 03:59:50.180]   And again, you're engaging the diaphragm
[03:59:50.180 --> 03:59:53.580]   instead of just your thorax right there.
[03:59:53.580 --> 03:59:56.900]   So you take that breath into your abdomen,
[03:59:56.900 --> 04:00:00.700]   in like through a small opening through your nose
[04:00:00.700 --> 04:00:05.140]   or through your pursed lips, you draw it in right there.
[04:00:05.140 --> 04:00:08.300]   And then, you know, down below, you pull it up.
[04:00:08.300 --> 04:00:11.960]   And then after that, it's that exhalation
[04:00:11.960 --> 04:00:13.160]   that didn't happen.
[04:00:13.160 --> 04:00:14.000]   Do you see?
[04:00:14.000 --> 04:00:14.820]   - I see.
[04:00:14.820 --> 04:00:18.900]   So I'm familiar with sort of bracing my abs.
[04:00:18.900 --> 04:00:22.340]   What I've not done before is the resisting,
[04:00:22.340 --> 04:00:24.300]   going to the bathroom thing that you mentioned,
[04:00:24.300 --> 04:00:25.500]   the pulling up of the butt.
[04:00:25.500 --> 04:00:27.700]   And then, so you're creating compression
[04:00:27.700 --> 04:00:28.900]   from the bottom and from the top.
[04:00:28.900 --> 04:00:30.180]   - And also from all around,
[04:00:30.180 --> 04:00:31.780]   that happens reflexively as well.
[04:00:31.780 --> 04:00:32.620]   - I see.
[04:00:32.620 --> 04:00:34.700]   So that's the position to get in to before, say,
[04:00:34.700 --> 04:00:37.060]   like a hard zurcher squat or something like that.
[04:00:37.060 --> 04:00:37.900]   - Absolutely.
[04:00:37.900 --> 04:00:40.260]   And if you're doing that for an exercise
[04:00:40.260 --> 04:00:43.220]   that's long, long in duration, you know,
[04:00:43.220 --> 04:00:45.480]   if you don't want to be holding your breath too long,
[04:00:45.480 --> 04:00:48.100]   then we have an expression that comes
[04:00:48.100 --> 04:00:51.700]   from one of the karate styles, breathing behind the shield.
[04:00:51.700 --> 04:00:54.900]   So right now I can speak to you,
[04:00:54.900 --> 04:00:56.620]   but I'm still just as tight.
[04:00:56.620 --> 04:00:57.700]   So you see what you're doing.
[04:00:57.700 --> 04:00:59.540]   So the way we test it at our,
[04:00:59.540 --> 04:01:01.900]   the way we teach it at our workshops is,
[04:01:01.900 --> 04:01:04.500]   you lie on the ground, I tell you to tense up,
[04:01:04.500 --> 04:01:05.820]   then I'm going to stand on your stomach,
[04:01:05.820 --> 04:01:07.620]   and I'm going to have you sing a song.
[04:01:07.620 --> 04:01:09.180]   And you're going to have to learn
[04:01:09.180 --> 04:01:11.140]   to properly maintain that pressure
[04:01:11.140 --> 04:01:15.380]   while still continuing to breathe.
[04:01:15.380 --> 04:01:17.580]   So you're able to stabilize your spine,
[04:01:17.580 --> 04:01:20.620]   but you're not going to pass out from maintaining that
[04:01:20.620 --> 04:01:23.620]   by holding your breath for a period of time.
[04:01:23.620 --> 04:01:26.500]   And then finally, what you got to learn to do
[04:01:26.500 --> 04:01:29.180]   is you got to learn to match the breath with the force.
[04:01:29.180 --> 04:01:33.540]   So synchronize, synchronize when you're punching,
[04:01:33.540 --> 04:01:38.060]   when you're throwing, when you're lifting,
[04:01:38.060 --> 04:01:40.660]   you have to learn how to match that contraction,
[04:01:40.660 --> 04:01:42.700]   the timing of the abdominal contraction
[04:01:42.700 --> 04:01:45.640]   and the pressurization, sometimes exhalation,
[04:01:45.640 --> 04:01:48.860]   sometimes just pretending to, with the effort.
[04:01:48.860 --> 04:01:51.460]   Once you learn how to match the breath with the force,
[04:01:51.460 --> 04:01:53.060]   it's like magic.
[04:01:53.060 --> 04:01:54.580]   And what people don't realize,
[04:01:54.580 --> 04:01:56.220]   it's not just purely mechanical.
[04:01:56.220 --> 04:01:58.020]   Mechanically, yes, of course it works.
[04:01:58.020 --> 04:01:59.500]   You know, Stu explained this so well
[04:01:59.500 --> 04:02:01.580]   about the stiffness of the structure,
[04:02:01.580 --> 04:02:03.180]   the analogy of the bicycle frame.
[04:02:03.180 --> 04:02:04.300]   It's the same thing.
[04:02:04.300 --> 04:02:06.020]   You're getting an expensive bicycle frame
[04:02:06.020 --> 04:02:07.420]   when you have strong abs,
[04:02:07.420 --> 04:02:11.140]   as opposed to the cheap one that rattles and wiggles.
[04:02:11.140 --> 04:02:15.020]   But there's also something that it's never,
[04:02:15.020 --> 04:02:18.380]   never spoken about in the West for some reason.
[04:02:18.380 --> 04:02:20.380]   The Soviets studied that decades ago.
[04:02:20.380 --> 04:02:23.340]   There's something they called the pneumo,
[04:02:23.340 --> 04:02:28.340]   pneumatic reflex, pneumo is P-N-E-U-M-O, so air.
[04:02:28.340 --> 04:02:30.780]   So there are barrier receptors,
[04:02:30.780 --> 04:02:33.900]   receptors for sensors for pressure
[04:02:33.900 --> 04:02:36.620]   inside your abdominal cavity and thoracic cavity.
[04:02:36.620 --> 04:02:41.620]   So whenever these receptors are stimulated,
[04:02:41.620 --> 04:02:45.300]   what they do is they automatically increase the sensitivity
[04:02:45.300 --> 04:02:46.820]   about alpha motor neurons.
[04:02:46.820 --> 04:02:50.200]   So what it really means to the audience is this.
[04:02:50.200 --> 04:02:53.360]   If you imagine your brain is the music player
[04:02:53.360 --> 04:02:57.560]   and imagine your muscle is a speaker,
[04:02:57.560 --> 04:03:00.440]   the amount of intra-abdominal pressure
[04:03:00.440 --> 04:03:02.080]   is your volume control.
[04:03:02.080 --> 04:03:05.160]   So by increasing that pressure,
[04:03:05.160 --> 04:03:06.440]   you're increasing the strength,
[04:03:06.440 --> 04:03:11.440]   but by releasing that intra-abdominal pressure,
[04:03:11.440 --> 04:03:12.600]   you relax the muscle.
[04:03:12.600 --> 04:03:14.720]   So that's why in stretching, as I mentioned before,
[04:03:14.720 --> 04:03:17.880]   you can't be sitting in a half split and groaning.
[04:03:17.880 --> 04:03:20.800]   No, you need to release.
[04:03:20.800 --> 04:03:23.560]   If you release that passive breath,
[04:03:23.560 --> 04:03:26.840]   again, your muscles are going to relax.
[04:03:26.840 --> 04:03:31.000]   So controlling your breath is very much,
[04:03:31.000 --> 04:03:32.440]   as it's known in martial arts,
[04:03:32.440 --> 04:03:35.120]   it's very much synonymous with controlling your body
[04:03:35.120 --> 04:03:36.480]   and your mind very often.
[04:03:36.480 --> 04:03:37.500]   - Fantastic.
[04:03:37.500 --> 04:03:42.120]   When one throws a punch,
[04:03:42.120 --> 04:03:46.920]   is it true that exhaling is actually providing
[04:03:46.920 --> 04:03:48.120]   additional power or?
[04:03:48.120 --> 04:03:48.960]   - No question about it.
[04:03:48.960 --> 04:03:50.760]   Yeah, it's been measured.
[04:03:50.760 --> 04:03:52.320]   It's been measured in fighters.
[04:03:52.320 --> 04:03:56.560]   It's also been measured in lifting as well.
[04:03:56.560 --> 04:03:59.840]   There was a study that was done in the West even
[04:03:59.840 --> 04:04:02.780]   when screaming increases strength significantly.
[04:04:02.780 --> 04:04:05.480]   And again, this is not just a psychological component.
[04:04:05.480 --> 04:04:08.680]   I mean, there may be some psychological component to that,
[04:04:08.680 --> 04:04:13.440]   but again, there's this very distinct increase of strength
[04:04:13.440 --> 04:04:17.560]   through that reflex.
[04:04:17.560 --> 04:04:21.200]   And it's very easy for the listeners to test that,
[04:04:21.200 --> 04:04:22.860]   get a dynamometer, hand gripper,
[04:04:22.860 --> 04:04:24.080]   and just test yourself on that.
[04:04:24.080 --> 04:04:27.600]   And just test it out with different breathing patterns
[04:04:27.600 --> 04:04:29.240]   and just see what happens.
[04:04:29.240 --> 04:04:32.720]   And whenever this idiotic practice at some gyms,
[04:04:32.720 --> 04:04:34.160]   oh, you can grunt right here.
[04:04:34.160 --> 04:04:36.940]   And it's just, well, I guess you can be strong here.
[04:04:36.940 --> 04:04:38.980]   And yeah, of course, if you're doing this on purpose,
[04:04:38.980 --> 04:04:41.200]   you're walking in with the bros and you're just trying
[04:04:41.200 --> 04:04:43.280]   just to make noise to attract attention.
[04:04:43.280 --> 04:04:44.240]   That's wrong.
[04:04:44.240 --> 04:04:49.240]   But strength is a noisy endeavor.
[04:04:49.240 --> 04:04:53.200]   So there may be some hissing, there may be some grunting.
[04:04:53.200 --> 04:04:55.480]   It's just absolutely unavoidable.
[04:04:55.480 --> 04:04:59.320]   And if you're trying to be quiet,
[04:04:59.320 --> 04:05:01.400]   and if you're trying to be a lady or a gentleman,
[04:05:01.400 --> 04:05:04.800]   well, maybe it's for somewhere else, not for the gym.
[04:05:04.800 --> 04:05:08.720]   - So some potentially trivial questions,
[04:05:08.720 --> 04:05:10.920]   but I think they are not trivial.
[04:05:10.920 --> 04:05:13.480]   I hope they're not in any case.
[04:05:13.480 --> 04:05:17.780]   Where should we place our eyes when we're in exertion?
[04:05:17.780 --> 04:05:21.160]   Close our eyes and grind it out.
[04:05:21.160 --> 04:05:23.700]   Look at form in the mirror.
[04:05:23.700 --> 04:05:26.360]   I'm a big fan of gyms without mirrors
[04:05:26.360 --> 04:05:28.400]   'cause I have to concentrate on the form.
[04:05:28.400 --> 04:05:33.320]   Vision is a powerful tool and source of feedback,
[04:05:33.320 --> 04:05:36.220]   but also a source of a lot of things.
[04:05:36.220 --> 04:05:37.640]   There must be a rule about this,
[04:05:37.640 --> 04:05:39.840]   or at least a set of guidelines for,
[04:05:39.840 --> 04:05:42.080]   are we eyes closed and grimacing?
[04:05:42.080 --> 04:05:45.840]   Are we checking our bicep vein in the mirror?
[04:05:45.840 --> 04:05:47.600]   Just kidding, don't do that, folks.
[04:05:47.600 --> 04:05:51.680]   During a lift, where should our eyes be?
[04:05:51.680 --> 04:05:53.080]   Is there any idea that looking up,
[04:05:53.080 --> 04:05:54.440]   it makes it easier to drive up
[04:05:54.440 --> 04:05:55.760]   out of the bottom of a squat?
[04:05:55.760 --> 04:05:56.600]   Has this been explored?
[04:05:56.600 --> 04:05:57.560]   - Well, it has.
[04:05:57.560 --> 04:05:59.240]   There are several sides to that.
[04:05:59.240 --> 04:06:04.240]   Part of it is the spinal safety.
[04:06:04.240 --> 04:06:07.400]   So Stu will tell you that extending the neck
[04:06:07.400 --> 04:06:09.720]   is going to facilitate the entire posterior chain.
[04:06:09.720 --> 04:06:12.320]   And he'll also tell you that lifters with longer necks
[04:06:12.320 --> 04:06:14.760]   may be able to get their heads up
[04:06:14.760 --> 04:06:17.280]   and that might work better for them.
[04:06:17.280 --> 04:06:19.960]   For some other lifters,
[04:06:19.960 --> 04:06:22.960]   especially those with pronounced lordosis
[04:06:22.960 --> 04:06:25.480]   where they're very arched, big arch in the back,
[04:06:25.480 --> 04:06:27.600]   that may arch them too much.
[04:06:27.600 --> 04:06:29.640]   That might be inappropriate or just kink their neck.
[04:06:29.640 --> 04:06:31.520]   It's all possible.
[04:06:31.520 --> 04:06:36.520]   And so a lot of coaches these days
[04:06:36.520 --> 04:06:38.520]   in lift like a deadlift,
[04:06:38.520 --> 04:06:41.360]   they try to including Andy Bolton.
[04:06:41.360 --> 04:06:44.480]   Andy Bolton is the legendary deadlifter.
[04:06:44.480 --> 04:06:47.040]   He is the one, the first lifter
[04:06:47.040 --> 04:06:50.760]   to lift over 1000 pounds in the deadlift.
[04:06:50.760 --> 04:06:52.520]   And Andy and I, we co-authored the book,
[04:06:52.520 --> 04:06:54.000]   "The Deadlift Dynamite."
[04:06:54.000 --> 04:06:56.440]   So Andy's got the most beautiful deadlift,
[04:06:56.440 --> 04:06:59.280]   just the most incredible, beautiful deadlift.
[04:06:59.280 --> 04:07:02.360]   So what Andy does is pretty much
[04:07:02.360 --> 04:07:04.560]   what the standard recommendation
[04:07:04.560 --> 04:07:06.320]   for most people is these days,
[04:07:06.320 --> 04:07:08.920]   where you're maintaining a neutral neck
[04:07:08.920 --> 04:07:11.280]   and your eyes kind of a go with that.
[04:07:11.280 --> 04:07:13.040]   So you get yourself in the position,
[04:07:13.040 --> 04:07:14.240]   you know, on the bottom of the deadlift,
[04:07:14.240 --> 04:07:17.760]   like where your head is the continuation of your body,
[04:07:17.760 --> 04:07:19.480]   like you're an insect or something.
[04:07:19.480 --> 04:07:21.520]   And then you look at the spot on the ground
[04:07:21.520 --> 04:07:22.960]   that's appropriate and your eyes will come up.
[04:07:22.960 --> 04:07:26.440]   So that's a good general standard recommendation.
[04:07:26.440 --> 04:07:29.080]   For people with long necks looking straight ahead,
[04:07:29.080 --> 04:07:31.280]   it's a good recommendation.
[04:07:31.280 --> 04:07:33.440]   Some lifters succeed with crazy ideas.
[04:07:33.440 --> 04:07:35.520]   Lamar Gant, that again, pound per pound,
[04:07:35.520 --> 04:07:36.840]   the biggest deadlifter,
[04:07:36.840 --> 04:07:39.120]   he was in tremendous hyperextension.
[04:07:39.120 --> 04:07:40.640]   He was looking at the ceiling.
[04:07:40.640 --> 04:07:44.360]   Then at a high level of competition,
[04:07:44.360 --> 04:07:46.160]   there are some other subtle ways,
[04:07:46.160 --> 04:07:47.840]   some things people try.
[04:07:47.840 --> 04:07:50.240]   So Konstantin Konstantinov from Latvia,
[04:07:50.240 --> 04:07:53.800]   he was another great deadlifter who passed.
[04:07:53.800 --> 04:07:57.480]   He would look down at the start.
[04:07:57.480 --> 04:07:58.480]   He would look absolutely down.
[04:07:58.480 --> 04:08:00.280]   He was pretty much...
[04:08:00.280 --> 04:08:05.280]   And if you look at it from your perspective,
[04:08:05.480 --> 04:08:07.080]   when your neck is in flexion,
[04:08:07.080 --> 04:08:09.800]   interestingly enough, that facilitates the knee extensors,
[04:08:09.800 --> 04:08:12.040]   which is really, really weird, yeah.
[04:08:12.040 --> 04:08:15.200]   - It's when I put my chin toward my chest.
[04:08:15.200 --> 04:08:16.760]   - Not all the way down, but yeah.
[04:08:16.760 --> 04:08:19.960]   You will find that your quads are going to be stronger.
[04:08:19.960 --> 04:08:21.080]   But it's not for everybody.
[04:08:21.080 --> 04:08:23.720]   For somebody else, that's a great way to mess up the back.
[04:08:23.720 --> 04:08:26.400]   So there are some subtleties.
[04:08:26.400 --> 04:08:27.600]   And there are also some people
[04:08:27.600 --> 04:08:30.200]   who really get fancy with the eyes, eye movement,
[04:08:30.200 --> 04:08:32.280]   follow the bar, do these other things,
[04:08:32.280 --> 04:08:34.200]   like it comes from gymnastics.
[04:08:34.200 --> 04:08:38.120]   A good rule of thumb is if you look straight ahead
[04:08:38.120 --> 04:08:40.640]   more often than not, you're going to be okay.
[04:08:40.640 --> 04:08:43.120]   But from that, there are a lot of fancy ways to do it.
[04:08:43.120 --> 04:08:44.920]   As for closing your eyes,
[04:08:44.920 --> 04:08:47.160]   closing your eyes is not recommended.
[04:08:47.160 --> 04:08:49.240]   It changes the coordination of the lift,
[04:08:49.240 --> 04:08:51.000]   but for advanced lifters,
[04:08:51.000 --> 04:08:53.400]   lifting blindfolded is a really good idea.
[04:08:53.400 --> 04:08:58.160]   So Robert Roman, one of the top Soviet specialists,
[04:08:58.160 --> 04:09:00.520]   he pioneered that and he would have his lifters
[04:09:00.520 --> 04:09:02.960]   do some of the sets blindfolded.
[04:09:02.960 --> 04:09:05.160]   And it's really amazing at how much
[04:09:05.160 --> 04:09:06.440]   not relying on your vision,
[04:09:06.440 --> 04:09:09.400]   relying on your kinesthetic sense, what that does.
[04:09:09.400 --> 04:09:11.600]   It's quite remarkable.
[04:09:11.600 --> 04:09:13.120]   And also just to add one more thing,
[04:09:13.120 --> 04:09:16.080]   at a competition, at least in powerlifting,
[04:09:16.080 --> 04:09:18.920]   a lot of, I mean, the top guys,
[04:09:18.920 --> 04:09:20.960]   they don't see anything, really.
[04:09:20.960 --> 04:09:23.120]   You know, they're just deep inside their rage.
[04:09:23.120 --> 04:09:25.240]   They're not, it's a total tunnel vision,
[04:09:25.240 --> 04:09:27.040]   auditory exclusion, everything.
[04:09:27.040 --> 04:09:29.400]   So it's whatever, they're ahead
[04:09:29.400 --> 04:09:30.840]   in whatever remembered position,
[04:09:30.840 --> 04:09:33.280]   but don't ask them to look at you or see you.
[04:09:33.280 --> 04:09:34.200]   That's not gonna happen.
[04:09:34.200 --> 04:09:35.200]   - They're someplace else.
[04:09:35.200 --> 04:09:36.040]   - Yep.
[04:09:36.040 --> 04:09:38.920]   - Pavel, I must say,
[04:09:38.920 --> 04:09:42.560]   this has been a spectacular voyage through.
[04:09:42.560 --> 04:09:43.400]   - You're very kind, Andrew.
[04:09:43.400 --> 04:09:45.080]   It's been a real pleasure.
[04:09:45.080 --> 04:09:47.640]   Very, very stimulating conversation.
[04:09:47.640 --> 04:09:48.520]   - Oh, thank you.
[04:09:48.520 --> 04:09:51.960]   And I'm going to just embarrass you a little bit further
[04:09:51.960 --> 04:09:55.240]   by telling you more positive things about you,
[04:09:55.240 --> 04:09:58.400]   'cause I noticed it makes you uncomfortable.
[04:09:58.400 --> 04:09:59.240]   It's perhaps the only thing
[04:09:59.240 --> 04:10:00.080]   that makes you uncomfortable,
[04:10:00.080 --> 04:10:01.000]   but in all seriousness,
[04:10:01.000 --> 04:10:04.280]   I don't think, I can't sense any discomfort.
[04:10:04.280 --> 04:10:06.840]   I want to just thank you for a number of things
[04:10:06.840 --> 04:10:08.280]   that are reflective, I'm sure,
[04:10:08.280 --> 04:10:09.480]   of what other people are thinking.
[04:10:09.480 --> 04:10:14.040]   First of all, the level of rigor
[04:10:14.040 --> 04:10:15.760]   that you've approached this whole thing
[04:10:15.760 --> 04:10:18.840]   of strength and fitness and flexibility and breathing
[04:10:18.840 --> 04:10:20.560]   and, you know, every one of these topics,
[04:10:20.560 --> 04:10:22.240]   too many to list off just now,
[04:10:22.240 --> 04:10:25.880]   is, it's remarkable.
[04:10:25.880 --> 04:10:26.720]   It's really fantastic.
[04:10:26.720 --> 04:10:27.560]   - Thank you.
[04:10:27.560 --> 04:10:29.200]   I love my job, so that's easy.
[04:10:29.200 --> 04:10:33.200]   - This comes through, and it's rare these days,
[04:10:33.200 --> 04:10:35.800]   but it's rare in any age to find people
[04:10:35.800 --> 04:10:40.800]   that are so dedicated to this level of rigor
[04:10:40.800 --> 04:10:43.720]   in a given area, and it's so appreciated.
[04:10:43.720 --> 04:10:44.800]   - Thank you, coming from you, it means a lot.
[04:10:44.800 --> 04:10:45.640]   Thank you.
[04:10:45.640 --> 04:10:47.000]   - Yeah, we need people like you.
[04:10:47.000 --> 04:10:49.000]   You're truly a scientist and a practitioner.
[04:10:49.000 --> 04:10:52.400]   You embody the principles that you discuss clearly,
[04:10:52.400 --> 04:10:53.240]   which is also important.
[04:10:53.240 --> 04:10:54.600]   - If I could blush, I would right now.
[04:10:54.600 --> 04:10:55.760]   [laughing]
[04:10:55.760 --> 04:10:56.600]   - Russians don't blush?
[04:10:56.600 --> 04:10:57.760]   - No. - No, got it.
[04:10:58.960 --> 04:11:00.800]   - Topic for another podcast.
[04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:03.440]   So that the rigor and the quality of the information
[04:11:03.440 --> 04:11:05.840]   that you put forth in your books and on this podcast
[04:11:05.840 --> 04:11:07.440]   and elsewhere, your online course,
[04:11:07.440 --> 04:11:09.640]   is just absolutely spectacular.
[04:11:09.640 --> 04:11:12.760]   And I hope people noticed, you know,
[04:11:12.760 --> 04:11:15.160]   I couldn't help but notice as an academic,
[04:11:15.160 --> 04:11:18.760]   but your attention to proper attribution
[04:11:18.760 --> 04:11:20.640]   for people that have done the work
[04:11:20.640 --> 04:11:22.040]   and accomplished the various feats
[04:11:22.040 --> 04:11:25.360]   from whom you've gleaned various aspects of this knowledge
[04:11:25.360 --> 04:11:26.760]   is not to be overlooked,
[04:11:26.760 --> 04:11:27.600]   because that's something
[04:11:27.600 --> 04:11:29.240]   that's so lacking these days. - It should go without saying.
[04:11:29.240 --> 04:11:31.880]   - It's just, it's so, it's remarkable
[04:11:31.880 --> 04:11:32.720]   and it's important to highlight.
[04:11:32.720 --> 04:11:35.000]   - It should go without saying, shouldn't it?
[04:11:35.000 --> 04:11:37.000]   - Yeah, it should go without saying, but it doesn't.
[04:11:37.000 --> 04:11:38.320]   You know, these days it's more about
[04:11:38.320 --> 04:11:39.520]   who can glean the most attention
[04:11:39.520 --> 04:11:44.320]   as opposed to shed light on others and their work.
[04:11:44.320 --> 04:11:46.520]   And in doing so, as we've observed,
[04:11:46.520 --> 04:11:49.160]   there's absolutely nothing is lost and so much is gained.
[04:11:49.160 --> 04:11:51.080]   It's for everybody, so thank you.
[04:11:51.080 --> 04:11:53.480]   That's a proper attribution. - Thank you, Frank Edwards.
[04:11:53.480 --> 04:11:55.240]   - Is spectacular.
[04:11:55.240 --> 04:11:58.560]   And I really look forward to sharing the resources
[04:11:58.560 --> 04:12:00.000]   where people can learn more,
[04:12:00.000 --> 04:12:01.720]   but already today you've just provided
[04:12:01.720 --> 04:12:03.200]   such a wealth of knowledge for us.
[04:12:03.200 --> 04:12:05.920]   And it's a real honor to sit here with you
[04:12:05.920 --> 04:12:07.240]   and to learn from you.
[04:12:07.240 --> 04:12:09.480]   I plan to listen to this podcast several times over
[04:12:09.480 --> 04:12:11.520]   and take detailed notes.
[04:12:11.520 --> 04:12:12.960]   We timestamp it all. - Thank you.
[04:12:12.960 --> 04:12:15.600]   - And I just hope that we'll have the opportunity
[04:12:15.600 --> 04:12:17.840]   at some point to sit down again,
[04:12:17.840 --> 04:12:20.880]   and as well, perhaps,
[04:12:20.880 --> 04:12:23.000]   to get the opportunity to train together.
[04:12:23.000 --> 04:12:24.720]   So I personally could learn from you,
[04:12:24.720 --> 04:12:26.280]   but in the meantime, on behalf of myself
[04:12:26.280 --> 04:12:28.040]   and everyone listening and watching,
[04:12:28.040 --> 04:12:29.480]   thank you ever so much, Pavel.
[04:12:29.480 --> 04:12:30.320]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[04:12:30.320 --> 04:12:31.440]   - You're a real- - Real pleasure.
[04:12:31.440 --> 04:12:32.280]   - You're a real gem, thank you.
[04:12:32.280 --> 04:12:35.440]   - And thank you for spreading the word of health
[04:12:35.440 --> 04:12:38.240]   and strength, strength and health.
[04:12:38.240 --> 04:12:39.640]   - Wonderful, thank you.
[04:12:39.640 --> 04:12:41.440]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[04:12:41.440 --> 04:12:42.760]   with Pavel Satsulin.
[04:12:42.760 --> 04:12:44.560]   I hope you found it to be as interesting
[04:12:44.560 --> 04:12:46.680]   and as actionable as I did.
[04:12:46.680 --> 04:12:48.080]   To learn more about Pavel's work,

[04:13:23.920 --> 04:13:25.040]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[04:13:25.040 --> 04:13:26.240]   I have a new book coming out.
[04:13:26.240 --> 04:13:27.840]   It's my very first book.
[04:13:27.840 --> 04:13:29.280]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[04:13:29.280 --> 04:13:31.400]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[04:13:31.400 --> 04:13:32.600]   This is a book that I've been working on
[04:13:32.600 --> 04:13:33.720]   for more than five years,
[04:13:33.720 --> 04:13:36.080]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[04:13:36.080 --> 04:13:37.600]   of research and experience.
[04:13:37.600 --> 04:13:40.680]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
[04:13:40.680 --> 04:13:43.160]   to exercise to stress control,
[04:13:43.160 --> 04:13:45.600]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[04:13:45.600 --> 04:13:49.000]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[04:13:49.000 --> 04:13:51.080]   for the protocols that are included.
[04:13:51.080 --> 04:13:54.960]   The book is now available by presale@protocolsbook.com.
[04:13:54.960 --> 04:13:57.320]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[04:13:57.320 --> 04:13:59.100]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[04:13:59.100 --> 04:14:00.880]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[04:14:00.880 --> 04:14:03.480]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[04:14:03.480 --> 04:14:05.560]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[04:14:05.560 --> 04:14:08.660]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[04:14:08.660 --> 04:14:11.400]   So that's Instagram X, formerly known as Twitter,
[04:14:11.400 --> 04:14:13.600]   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Threads.
[04:14:13.600 --> 04:14:14.800]   And on all those platforms,
[04:14:14.800 --> 04:14:16.880]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[04:14:16.880 --> 04:14:18.440]   some of which overlaps with the content
[04:14:18.440 --> 04:14:19.840]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[04:14:19.840 --> 04:14:21.880]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[04:14:21.880 --> 04:14:23.400]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[04:14:23.400 --> 04:14:26.840]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[04:14:26.840 --> 04:14:28.160]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[04:14:28.160 --> 04:14:29.760]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[04:14:29.760 --> 04:14:31.020]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[04:14:31.020 --> 04:14:33.080]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[04:14:33.080 --> 04:14:34.440]   that includes podcast summaries,
[04:14:34.440 --> 04:14:36.240]   as well as what we call protocols
[04:14:36.240 --> 04:14:38.520]   in the form of one- to three-page PDFs
[04:14:38.520 --> 04:14:40.800]   that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep,
[04:14:40.800 --> 04:14:43.600]   how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[04:14:43.600 --> 04:14:45.360]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[04:14:45.360 --> 04:14:48.440]   that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[04:14:48.440 --> 04:14:50.920]   All of that is available completely zero cost.
[04:14:50.920 --> 04:14:52.620]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[04:14:52.620 --> 04:14:54.520]   go to the Menu tab in the top right corner,
[04:14:54.520 --> 04:14:57.040]   scroll down to Newsletter, and enter your email.
[04:14:57.040 --> 04:14:58.720]   And I should emphasize that we do not share
[04:14:58.720 --> 04:15:00.440]   your email with anybody.
[04:15:00.440 --> 04:15:01.800]   Thank you once again for joining me
[04:15:01.800 --> 04:15:04.280]   for today's discussion with Pavel Satsulin.
[04:15:04.280 --> 04:15:06.480]   And last, but certainly not least,
[04:15:06.480 --> 04:15:08.480]   thank you for your interest in science.
[04:15:08.480 --> 04:15:11.060]   [upbeat music]
[04:15:11.060 --> 04:15:13.640]   (upbeat music)
