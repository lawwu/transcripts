[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Good Monday morning, everyone.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.880]   We have a big week on the podcast for you, and first up, our inbox is full of emails
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.400]   asking whether or not it's a good idea to dramatize Christ's life for television.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.320]   A listener named Jim asks it this way.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.720]   "Dear Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.120]   I'm wondering of the dangers and benefits of watching biblical historical fiction, particularly
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.720]   of television shows and movies about the life of Christ, of him acting and saying dramatized
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200]   things beyond what we read in scripture."
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.560]   One anonymous man writes in to say, "Dear Pastor John, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.160]   It has been used by God to help me and my family here in Kazakhstan.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.040]   I would like to know your thoughts on television shows and movies about the life of Christ.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.640]   Are they helpful or unhelpful?
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.520]   What are your concerns?"
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.640]   And Sam, a church leader, wants to know, "The place of visuals, particularly screen dramatizations
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480]   about the life of Christ.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.920]   One recent show is 'beloved by many' in his church."
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.640]   And he says, "I feel it has enlivened my own walk with God and helped me imagine what
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520]   Jesus' world could have been like.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.900]   This has the effect of making the world of the Bible more accessible to me, but imagination
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.580]   can only take you so far.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.400]   Can we enjoy shows like this personally, even include them in a teaching context without
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.840]   violating the second commandment?"
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.400]   And finally, another listener, Lisa, is less optimistic.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.700]   She says television dramatizations of Christ's life, "don't sit well with me."
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.140]   As she considers Proverbs 30, verse 6, and Revelation 22, verse 18, she wonders if these
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.200]   dramas are adding to or altering Scripture, amounting to heresy.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.080]   Pastor John, for these listeners, do you have any thoughts?
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.040]   There is no way that I can avoid this question because it touches on my life.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.920]   Because for 25 years, and I still do it one way or the other, for 25 years, when I was
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.560]   a pastor at Bethlehem, every Christmas season, I created and read to the people in worship
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.920]   what we call Advent poems, one for each Sunday during Advent.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.140]   The poems took about 10 minutes to read.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.060]   They created a story built around a biblical character or biblical situation in which I
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.940]   invented persons, and I invented dialogue, and I invented circumstances that were not
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:35.840]   in the Bible but were intended to clarify and confirm and intensify realities that are
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.500]   in the Bible, that the Bible itself teaches.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.300]   So the question is not abstract for me.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.820]   The question is, was I doing something sinful?
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.180]   Was it wrong to create those poetic, imaginative expressions?
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.360]   So let me mention the safeguards that I put in place to avoid the dangers of distorting
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.860]   Scripture or replacing Scripture or diminishing the authority of Scripture, and then I'll
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.100]   give some positive reasons for why I think imaginative explanations and illustrations
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:25.260]   and representations of biblical truth are not only legitimate but are even encouraged
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.420]   by the Bible.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:38.620]   So first, was I guilty of disobeying Proverbs 30 or 6, Revelation 22, 18, which says that
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.020]   we should not add to the words of God or to the prophecy of Scripture?
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:56.140]   No, I was not guilty of disobeying those Scriptures because those Scriptures forbid the presumption
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.440]   that one could add Scripture to Scripture or prophecy to prophecy.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.200]   Those texts are not condemning explanation and elucidation and illustration and representation
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.400]   of Scripture, which make no claim in themselves to have any Scripture-level authority.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.640]   Those texts are condemning every attempt to use words or images or representations that
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.140]   claim to be on a par with Scripture.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.540]   In fact, I would say that the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of this error when it elevates
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.820]   the papal pronouncements ex cathedra to the level of infallible biblical authority.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.820]   That's my first safeguard.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.540]   Second, I made clear that the poems I was reading were not Scripture.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.680]   I made it clear.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.900]   They were not divinely inspired.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.780]   They were not infallible.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:11.780]   They were imaginative illustration and explanation and representation of truth that I saw in
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.000]   the biblical text.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.060]   I made this distinction not only when reading poetry, but when preaching.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.100]   My preaching is not Scripture.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.740]   It is based on Scripture.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.820]   It uses language that is not in Scripture.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.940]   All preaching does.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.420]   All teaching does.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.580]   It derives any authority that it has from the degree that it faithfully represents the
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.420]   reality put forth in the Bible.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.260]   So it is with imaginative poetry or drama, for that matter.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:06:01.060]   Third, I promised never to create any dialogue or any character or any circumstance that
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.380]   could not have happened in view of what the Bible actually teaches.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.760]   In other words, even though I created things that were not in the Bible, nothing I created
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.420]   contradicted what was in the Bible.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.620]   Everything had to be possible and plausible in view of what was in the Bible.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.540]   Nothing was allowed to call Scripture into question.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:35.600]   Fourth, I made every effort to draw attention and affection to the same reality in my poems
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.940]   that I saw in the Scripture itself.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:50.420]   And fifth, I never replaced expository preaching with imaginative poetry.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.960]   In other words, I tried to make plain that God had ordained the expository preaching
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:08.260]   of his infallible Word as central to congregational life and as the main corporate means by which
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.580]   God protects his Word from distortion.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:19.980]   Through every other form of representation, preaching stood.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.620]   Preaching remained dominant and essential.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:33.580]   And in my case, the sermon was never, not once in 33 years, intermingled with any kind
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.940]   of visual media.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:42.620]   I think that's a bad practice in preaching and is usually owing to a loss of confidence
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.900]   in the preached Word to do its amazing work.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.180]   Now, those are the safeguards that I put in place to keep from diminishing Scripture or
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.300]   distorting Scripture or replacing Scripture.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:03.060]   But I think even more important is the fact that imaginative representations of biblical
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.400]   reality are warranted by Scripture itself.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:17.140]   Of course, in biblical times, nobody had ever heard of movies or videos, and so nothing
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.780]   directly is said in the Bible about them.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:32.180]   But short of that, pointers to imaginative representations and drama are everywhere in
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.540]   the Bible.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:43.660]   First, the Bible itself uses imaginative language that creates pictures in our minds that are
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:52.580]   not the same as the reality being discussed, but which shed light on the reality by not
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.340]   being the reality itself.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.940]   We call these metaphors or similes or word pictures or parables.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:14.300]   For example, just listen to Jude 1, 12, and 13 describing the false teachers and the troublemakers
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   in the church.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.820]   Here it is.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:26.100]   These are hidden reefs at your love feasts as they feast with you without fear, shepherds
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:35.500]   feeding themselves, waterless clouds swept along by winds, fruitless trees in autumn
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:43.780]   twice dead, uprooted, wild waves of the sea casting up the foam of their shame, wandering
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:50.220]   stars for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.500]   That's amazing.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:59.340]   He's talking about human beings, bad people who are ruining the church.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.740]   What does he do?
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:08.820]   He creates pictures in our brains with words like "hidden reefs," "selfish shepherds,"
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:17.100]   "waterless clouds," "fruitless trees," "wild waves," "wandering stars."
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:25.540]   In other words, he tries to make plain one objective reality by comparing it to a very
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.180]   different reality.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.340]   Jesus did this with parables, didn't he?
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:37.340]   The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, like leaven, like a treasure, like a merchant,
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.760]   like a net, like a master of a house, and on and on.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.040]   Or consider the prophets like Zechariah.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.160]   He sees a reality.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.500]   He wants us to know the reality.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.100]   How shall he help us see and savor this reality?
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.620]   He says, "I see a measuring line.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.900]   I see a lampstand.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.460]   I see a flying scroll.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.140]   I see a woman in a basket."
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.460]   The Bible does this kind of thing hundreds and hundreds of times.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:15.380]   It's the very nature of language to be different from the reality it points to.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.700]   The word "love" is not the same as the reality of love.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.860]   The word "God" is not the same as the reality of God.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:31.200]   The word "salvation" is not the same as the reality of salvation.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:39.820]   And once you realize that all language is pointing to reality, that the job of the preacher
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:48.300]   or the poet or the teacher or the parent is to help others see and savor reality, then
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:56.500]   you realize all the amazing and various potentials that language has.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:05.200]   And then there's not just imaginative language, there is imaginative action in the Bible,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.720]   acted-out dramas of biblical reality.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:18.240]   Jeremiah was told to make yoke bars and walk around with this heavy yoke on his shoulders
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.260]   to dramatize the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar on the people.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:30.320]   And Ezekiel was told by God to lie on his left side for 390 days to illustrate Israel's
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.480]   years of punishment.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.640]   And then there's poor Isaiah.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:43.720]   God said, "My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.880]   a portent against Egypt and Cush."
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.800]   It's Isaiah 20, verse 3.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:13:03.640]   So my conclusion is that if we pause and ponder why the Bible itself employs so many imaginative
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:13.800]   means of explaining and illustrating and representing reality, we will see that the Bible itself
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:25.480]   offers us, one, examples of truth-clarifying, truth-intensifying drama and poetry, language,
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:39.120]   and two, encourages us to use language this way, and three, protects us against distorting
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.280]   or replacing or diminishing Scripture.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.480]   Thank you for sharing those biblical dramatizations, Pastor John.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.840]   And thank you to everyone who sent in some form of this question.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.040]   It's really helpful to hear from you all.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.440]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast,

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.880]   Well when you pray, Jesus said, go into your room, shut the door, and pray to your Father
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.680]   who is in secret.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.480]   That's Matthew 6, 6, so we should just pray alone, right?
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   Wrong.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.880]   We don't only pray in secret, we pray together.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.320]   In fact, people are praying together all over the book of Acts, for example.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.200]   So why do we pray together and not just alone?
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.120]   What's added when we pray together?
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.520]   And what's lost when we only pray by ourselves?
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.240]   It's an interesting question, and it's on the table on Wednesday.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.240]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.740]   We'll see you then.
