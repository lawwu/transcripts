[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   Hey, everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast with Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.680]   We record this podcast, well, on a really unique schedule, Chamath. What's our schedule right now,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.800]   whenever we feel like it? Basically, it is whenever our significant others get so sick of us
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.360]   that they kick us off and say, don't come back. Yeah, we get thrown to the pool house. We decide
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.380]   to pop up the podcast. You're in Atherton. I'm in the city in San Francisco. Thank you,
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.220]   Duke of Discretion. Is there anything else you'd like to do? Tell them my address, my gate code.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.020]   Gate code, off the fence. We had two guests on that people just went absolutely crazy for.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.280]   But they weren't available, so. We're just going to talk shit about them.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.940]   No, we have two amazing Davids in our lives, David Friedberg and David Sachs. They are super smart,
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.200]   super effective at their work. Everything we're not, Chamath. We bring them back on the podcast.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.680]   And we'll do a little roundtable here and talk about life in the age of corona. So welcome back
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360]   to the podcast, David Sachs. Yeah, good to be back with you.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.420]   And also David Friedberg. Thank you, guys. Happy to be here.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.280]   All right. Fantastic. So I just want to start off with our quarr check. How is everybody doing
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.920]   in this quarantine? How's everybody's mental health? Let's start with you, Sachs.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.020]   Well, as you might be able to see, we've moved our
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.060]   bunker to undisclosed Mexican location. And it's been great.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.640]   I think it's really kind of sad because where we're at is a tourist city that would normally be
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.280]   at peak season. And it's just deserted right now. All the construction stopped.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.920]   Normally, you see lots of hotels and houses being built, and that's all stopped.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.000]   And there's no tourists. So it's all just...
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.480]   It's kind of cleared out. But I think it's quite safe. Every worker that I've seen here since
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.540]   we landed at the airport got transported to the community we're at has been wearing a mask,
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.500]   much more consistent than I think in the US. And I think it's been fine.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.660]   Now, of course, you founded the Kraft Venture Capital Firm. And people know before that,
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.880]   you obviously did Yammer and sold that to...
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.400]   Microsoft for a billion dollars plus. And before that, you were the COO at PayPal.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.500]   What's going on with your business? Are you actively investing? And how is your firm running
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.120]   remote?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:48.220]   It's worked very well. I mean, we've always been super collaborative as a firm. We were already on
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.700]   Zoom and we share everything on Yammer. And so for us, just moving to Zoom wasn't that difficult.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.440]   We've done four or five deals, I think, since the whole quarantine started.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   I'm sorry. Did you say that you actually use Yammer now in 2020?
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.140]   We're still using it.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.900]   Oh, my God. Is Yammer still available? That's insane.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.760]   I mean, it's kind of gone a little bit buried inside of Microsoft, but you can certainly still
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.720]   get it. And no, we love it. I mean, the whole firm kind of works in Yammer. And it works very well
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.120]   for us.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.640]   And now what's going to happen with this incredible office that you've got?
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.920]   You have this beautiful office you have in San Francisco in commercial real estate now that
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.520]   are you going to come back to work? We saw Twitter and Square, the Jack collection of
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.420]   companies. They're not going to come back to their offices. They work from home primarily
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.300]   going forward. What are you going to do? Well, it'll be a great asset for us in the
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.500]   year 2025 or something like that. No, I mean, we will eventually go back to work there.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.020]   I think that the team still likes having an office. I think the idea that everyone wants to work out of
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.300]   a small room and extra room in their house, I think it's probably a little overrated. I think
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.220]   people would like to get back to the office. But do we have to have one? No. I mean, I think we've
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.500]   proven that we can do our jobs via Zoom. And we've done a lot of, like I said, we've done
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.820]   four or five deals since this started where we haven't met with the entrepreneur in person. It's
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.400]   all been done via Zoom. And it's worked great. All right, Chamath, how are you doing? How's
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.580]   your mental health like? I get to see you once in a while on CNBC throwing bombs. But how are you
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:45.100]   doing? I was really excited for phase two of the shelter in place to start here in San Mateo County.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.920]   So that's been really good. A new poker table that I had built arrived today, which I'll be
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.280]   installing after this. And what I mean by that is I'm going to be installing a new poker table
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.940]   I'll be installing uh you'll be supervising I'll be supervising you'll be watching as people do
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.580]   real work watching and um it's a beautiful table I saw the pictures of it doesn't have an infinity
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.780]   edge is it an infinity edge table no no no no but I'll send you a picture when it's all done but
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.000]   it just looks stunning um and I really want to try to organize the game soon so that I can get
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.820]   you guys back into the um into my little cave here yeah I am uh ready for this shelter in place to
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.760]   end uh I'll just be honest and uh I think that my sentiments are the sentiments of a lot of people
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.280]   it's uh it's really tough really really tough I I'm I'm losing all my motivation to be quite honest
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.360]   it is weird to not see people even and you're an extrovert uh David you're an introvert and then
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.480]   David Freeberg also on the line David uh how are you handling all of this
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.100]   I'm fine I think uh one of the things that made a huge difference for me is the uh
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.800]   creating a rhythm in the day because there
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.920]   isn't one when you kind of normally get up and you go to work and then you come home at the end
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.800]   of the day from work that's a rhythm and you're you kind of get kind of adjusted to it so not
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.920]   having that a lot of people I've been hearing are struggling with that I was certainly struggling
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.480]   with it having sleep issues and I sit on about a dozen boards some of which are small companies
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.320]   some of which have a couple hundred employees and I've been hearing pretty consistently mental health
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   issues across all the companies uh and I think it's just been really grating on people I think it
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.780]   number one is that there's a lot of people who are struggling with their sleep issues and I think
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.820]   number one kind of says we probably do need to be together and have social space uh as David said
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.180]   like being in the same office people really miss that and you get a lot of value from that
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.200]   um I know I've been getting up every day in the last couple of weeks and going off-site going out
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.580]   of my house to go work uh we're actually working on another place and I have like a little office
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.600]   there and I go kind of work there um and so that's made a huge impact honestly on my mental health
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.940]   being able to do that every day so um just doing that's been helpful not everyone has that privilege
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.020]   but uh I think it speaks a lot to why we're going to need to go back to offices when this is all done
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.220]   and what do you think about what's happening with your businesses obviously you're running a
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.420]   a startup studio I guess would be one way to describe it where you create companies and then
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.660]   spin them out what's been the business interruption if any uh we have a couple of hardware and lab
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.160]   companies that's most of what we've done and so those operations are paused so that's been really
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.640]   frustrating the teams have all found ways to adjust and work from home so our companies are
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.920]   not predominantly software-based there's a lot of software
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.540]   but it's not predominantly software so it's been difficult on those uh scientists and engineers
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.520]   that work in a lab or in a physical environment that they have to go to to do their work uh the
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.120]   larger companies we have a number of food businesses that uh happen to be in the food
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.920]   supply chain one way or another frankly those businesses are doing fantastically well uh and
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.500]   there's been just this incredible success uh in the era of covid on kind of a focus on fundamentals
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.620]   like food supply chain efficiency availability of things that people need and we were doing a lot in
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:58.360]   the past and we've kind of benefited from that um so yeah I think uh it's kind of a mix for us but uh
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.400]   I think every business is bifurcated one way or another during this kind of moment of punctuated
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.380]   equilibrium yeah I think one thing I'd like to sort of talk about is we've had you both on the
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.200]   podcast early on at the start of the pandemic and I'm curious Chamath now that we're here
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.080]   um over two months in quarantine uh sheltering in place and a lot of information a lot of cards
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.880]   have turned over here right we've seen the flop I think
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.180]   we haven't seen the the turn in the river so to speak what is your assessment of what we were
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.100]   talking about you know a month or two ago and what we thought about this and what's become reality and
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.120]   what hasn't what are you more optimistic about what are you more pessimistic about Chamath let's
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:49.760]   start with you I think that um we will have this pandemic or this disease uh well in hand within
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.860]   two years and so whether it's a combination of a
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:09:00.120]   therapeutic end of vaccine or just a therapeutic um I just think that we're gonna kick its ass and
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.720]   so that's made me more optimistic um I think that the thing that's made me more pessimistic
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:14.940]   though is the return to normalcy has been sort of cut on political lines and it's been so massively
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.200]   politicized I mean when David talks about the fact that you know you can go to a developing country
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.840]   like Mexico and all of a sudden you know everybody can get around
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:29.020]   the idea of masks it's because that there's a level of common sense there that uh trumps politics
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:34.960]   and uh in the United States that just isn't the case and so what you're seeing in in this crazy
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:43.540]   way I think is sort of the center left and the left uh probably sticking very firmly to the
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:51.280]   ideology of sheltering in place and a lockdown probably on the sort of hope that it gets Trump
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:57.520]   out of office and on the other side sort of the red states I think have basically said hey uh I
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.700]   would rather get sick from coronavirus and take my chances than the hundred percent chance of failure
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.440]   that I have in my professional life if you leave me at home for another week or month or what have
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.320]   you um so that's been a huge disappointment of how political this whole thing has gotten and
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.620]   sax you've been talking about like common sense procedures sort of same question to you what you
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.260]   first thought and what you thought about the pandemic and what you thought about the pandemic
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.580]   and you had been talking about you thought an L-shaped recovery so we'll get into also the
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.640]   economy here but in terms of the disease what did you think two months ago that you don't think now
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.520]   and what do you think uh yeah well in preparation for this I kind of went through my Twitter feed
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:43.280]   to see uh what I was saying the last time I was on the pod and how well it was holding up and
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:51.240]   two months ago today I tweeted that um the pandemic that under reaction caused the pandemic and overreaction
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.420]   will cause the depression and I think that's kind of where we are right now um we still have this
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:03.000]   pandemic with us but now we're also potentially facing I think a potential depression because of
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.840]   the way we're we're overreacting we're still in lockdowns um in you know huge swaths of the of the
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.860]   country um and uh no one can quite understand why I mean the original reason for the lockdowns was
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.220]   to buy us time so that the hospitals wouldn't become overwhelmed like Italy
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.600]   well nowhere in the country did the hospitals get overwhelmed and we're still in these lockdowns and
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:33.820]   um and so you know I I I think that um it's it's long overdue for for it to end now at the same time
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:39.880]   you know where I agree with Chamath that this whole thing's become politicized where um you
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.040]   know the the people who generally want to get us out of lockdowns don't believe in doing anything
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.720]   you know they're not even a lot of them aren't even willing to wear masks which I think is just
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.560]   kind of insane
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.740]   um so you know where I come out on this thing is that I think we should end lockdowns but wear
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:03.220]   masks and it's very hard to find anybody you know in the in the political spectrum who who agrees
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.680]   with that because you know one side wants to keep lockdowns going indefinitely and the other doesn't
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.300]   want us to wear masks and it makes no logical sense obviously and if you think about our political
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:19.060]   system the left is so far left that the moderates on the left side don't have a place to live anymore
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.400]   and then on the right the
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.220]   conservatives which I would put you in uh the group of who were um you know looking for fiscal
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.520]   conservatives conservatives um they don't have a home anymore either and so the most reasonable
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:40.620]   approach is clearly to start going back to work for people who are not at risk and who wear a mask
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.840]   yeah I think I think there's been since the last pod that we did together I think there's been
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.320]   three kind of major discoveries or sets of facts that have come out of that and I think that's a
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:46.880]   big part of the reason why we're doing this because we're not going to be able to do it again
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.280]   and we're not going to be able to do it again and we're not going to be able to do it again
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.780]   and we're not going to be able to do it again and we're not going to be able to do it again
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.080]   and we're not going to be able to do it again and we're not going to be able to do it again
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.960]   um so I think that's a big part of the reason why we're doing this because we're not going to be
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.680]   able to do it again and we're not going to be able to do it again
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:59.120]   number one um the official fatality rate has been over which is about six percent um you know it's
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:05.040]   a very high fatality rate it's pretty scary but we now know that that's overstated by probably at
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:13.120]   least 10x um because it doesn't take into account all the asymptomatic cases or mild cases uh that
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.000]   just never got tested um and this is the fatality rate of people who contracted the virus
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.320]   right as a yes exactly uh as opposed to people whose case the the the problem with the uh it's
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.760]   kind of a debate between the the ifr versus the cfr the infection fatality rate versus the case
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.440]   fatality rate the um the problem with kind of the official cfr numbers is that only the people who
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.240]   got really sick or you know ever got tested and um you know freeburg was the earliest person um
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.680]   I know to start talking about the need for wide scale population testing and these blood serology
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.440]   tests and other kinds of tests to establish what the real baseline is um but regardless of like and
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.120]   there's been a whole bunch of different tests with different results um I you know um we don't know
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.760]   exactly what the true ifr is to this day but we do know it's probably closer to half a percent than
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:12.560]   to five percent so that's sort of discovery number one I think discovery number two is and we knew a
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.400]   little bit we saw a little bit of this from the wuhan data but now it's really clear
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.160]   at risk that which populations are at risk.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.540]   The data seems to suggest that people under 60 who are healthy don't have pre-existing
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:35.860]   conditions are 50 times less likely to develop or there's a 50x greater chance for those
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:41.580]   over 60 in terms of having a really bad outcome.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.760]   For people under 60 who don't have these pre-existing conditions, it's just not … Yes, there's
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:53.420]   always examples to the contrary, but it's not this gigantic risk.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.440]   For two-thirds of the population, they don't have a huge risk and we're still locking
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.180]   them down.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:04.620]   I think the third study, not just study, there's been studies and there's been models and
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:13.580]   then we've also seen practice, is that wide-scale use of masks or ubiquitous mask wearing is
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.160]   sufficient to control the virus.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.960]   To stop the exponentiality of the virus.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:26.920]   We've seen in the Asian countries or Czechoslovakia, other places, they've been able to get the
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:34.120]   so-called R-naught, the viral coefficient, to go below one with wide-scale use of masks.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:42.020]   We have a way to prevent the virus from going exponential that doesn't require lockdowns.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.460]   The thing I blogged about the last time I was on your show was, "Why would you use a mask?"
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:42.920]   I was like, "I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.320]   You're talking about the virus."
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.420]   I was like, "I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.780]   Why would you use a mask?"
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:43.880]   I was like, "Why would you use a mask?"
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.120]   I was like, "Why would you use a mask?"
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.380]   I was like, "Why would you use a mask?"
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.520]   I was like, "Why would you use a mask?"
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.880]   I was like, "Why would you use a mask?" The last time I was on your show was, "Why
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.740]   would you do this most severe thing, these lockdowns, and not do this easy thing that's
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.120]   just merely inconvenient, which is a mask?"
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.300]   Freberg, when you look at it, and you're the, I think, have the deepest science, clearly
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.720]   have the deepest science background of all of us.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.200]   How do you look at this pandemic, now that we're 75 days into it here in the Bay Area,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.820]   and obviously this started in December, it looks like, in China?
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.920]   What's your take on it now?
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.100]   What did you get right early, and what have you changed your mind about recently?
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.580]   I think, I'm actually funny, when you say that, I just pulled up the original
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.680]   WHO joint mission on COVID final report.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.940]   The date of this report, by the way, is February 20th.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:37.660]   There was this big thing they published, 40 pages long from the WHO, and in it, they highlighted
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:43.320]   this fatality rate estimate inside of Hubei, Wuhan, and outside of Hubei.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.140]   We knew from this data very early on that we were at about a half percent fatality rate.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.880]   And then we saw all of this other stuff happen with Korea, and the Princess cruise ship,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.320]   and the NBA players.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.500]   Very early on, we saw all these people that were roughly asymptomatic, and we're starting
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.960]   to get two kind of explanations for why that is.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.780]   But from the beginning, I felt really like this is going to be a largely asymptomatic
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.300]   kind of spreading infectious factor.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.320]   What I got wrong…
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   What?
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.820]   was when we went into lockdown.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.240]   I don't know, Chamath, if you remember this,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.980]   when we talked the first time on Jason's,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.580]   on your guys' podcast.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.920]   I asked you guys, or you guys asked me
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.720]   when I thought we'd be back.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.400]   And I was like, oh, April 7th, we'll be back to work.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.040]   And I also had a bet going with you guys.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.520]   And I said, we're going to have less than 20,000
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.280]   deaths in the US.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   I so overestimated the effectiveness of the lockdown.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.040]   And I think that was kind of, you know,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.960]   one of the more kind of like striking things to me
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   is the quote unquote lockdown.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.580]   And I just sent a video to Nick.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.480]   Nick, do you have it?
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.100]   Can you queue it up?
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.320]   So basically, this is what I think has happened
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.040]   in the United States.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.960]   Like pull this thing up.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.160]   I was in Berkeley on Saturday.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.840]   And I went to play, to meet some buddies.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.720]   And we played Frisbee golf on campus
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.460]   and had a beer, some college buddies of mine.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.440]   And so I'm walking around in Berkeley
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   and there is frat party after frat party going on.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.060]   No masks.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.420]   Everyone's on top of each other.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.000]   You can see the video right here.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.920]   I took a video of one of the frat parties.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.540]   I think that's beer pong.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.320]   Yeah, they're all paying beer pong.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.640]   There's like girls and drinking.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.200]   And people are passing around bottles of vodka.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.560]   And there's no mask.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.260]   And this was the entire campus of Berkeley.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.840]   And I think this is what's gone on around the country.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.520]   So the belief that you could just kind of lock away the virus,
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.380]   I believe like, oh my God, it's so extreme.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.220]   It's so draconian.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.540]   We're going to shut down the world.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.720]   And this thing is going to get stopped in 30 days
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.060]   like happened in China.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.380]   That is not what happened in the United States of America.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.560]   People want to be free.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.360]   People want to party.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.340]   People want to live their life.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.160]   They want to go to work.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.820]   They want to see their friends and family.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.540]   And they're not used to being told no by the government.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.160]   And so I think that's been, to me,
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.580]   the biggest surprise is just like how ineffective
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.220]   the quote unquote lockdown has been.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.960]   And I think it really speaks to the need that David mentioned,
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.120]   which is this lockdown isn't binary.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.320]   You can't just say lock everyone down or let them all out.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.480]   You've got to nuance your way to a solution,
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.240]   which means like masks,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.080]   which means watching out for nursing homes,
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.280]   which means temperature checking
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.480]   before letting people into buildings of over 100 people,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.800]   like all the stuff that I think needs to be done
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.420]   for this to be kind of effective at tracking and tracing.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.480]   And we can't just assume that,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   you know, a quote unquote lockdown
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.340]   is going to keep people inside
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.240]   and keep this thing from spreading
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.740]   because the frat party, as you'll see,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.920]   is the perfect representation
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.480]   of what's really going on out there.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.400]   All right, circling back around to you, Chamath,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   what do you think of what the two Davids
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.200]   sort of outlined there in terms of the path forward
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.500]   and how we all handicapped what was going on?
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:39.540]   Well, I think the reality is that by hook or crook,
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.020]   we're going to basically exit this lockdown sooner
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.460]   than we think because I think people
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.500]   just can't take it anymore.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.860]   So there's no point in having a shelter in place order
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.660]   if everybody's running around playing beer pong.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.540]   And so it's not doing anything.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.940]   And so you might as well get the productive value
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.060]   of the economy going again
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.620]   by letting people go back to work.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:06.040]   You know, we, and just finding some simple ways
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.780]   that people can look past the politics
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.000]   and just do the right thing.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.540]   And so I think that's the reality.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.660]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.620]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:15.660]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:15.700]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:15.740]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:15.780]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:15.860]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:15.920]   And I think that's the reality.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.840]   It's really like, I mean, when you think about it,
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.020]   it's like, why is this such a big deal?
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.300]   Get everything you want
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.440]   and just put a little bit of cloth over your face.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.320]   I mean, a lot of the folks that push back on this,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.240]   you know, they're better off wearing the mask.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.380]   I mean, it is pretty striking when you watch the protests
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.780]   and you see a bunch of people who are, you know,
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.900]   obviously older and obviously obese.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.820]   Those are not the people.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.420]   Those are not the best looking knives in the drawer.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.400]   Let's just put it that way.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.380]   Not, definitely not.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.080]   And-
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.680]   Little dull and rusty is what I would say.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.560]   Well, and you know, they're carrying guns
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.100]   and they've never served a day in the army.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.260]   I mean, it's, they're literally cosplaying Marines.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.040]   I have nothing to say about that.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.420]   All I'm saying is this whole mask thing
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.320]   is not such a big deal.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.720]   Just if you can wear a mask and get back to being productive
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.700]   and get back to a job, I think you should be allowed to.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.280]   All right.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.340]   So we had a big debate, V-shaped, W-shaped,
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.200]   U-shaped, L-shaped recovery.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.720]   I was in the-
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.920]   I'm aspirationally V-shaped, but I'm expecting a U.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.480]   Sax, you were the L.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.140]   And I think Chamath, you were the W, the U or the L.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.740]   We've had a V.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.020]   How do you explain, Chamath,
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.660]   what is going on in the stock market?
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.200]   Because you said it was the end of days.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.240]   You said this is going to be a disaster.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.140]   Is it going to be a disaster?
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.360]   Is this the end of the days
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.940]   and we've got some false rebound
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.420]   and this V-shaped recovery is not sustainable?
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.880]   How do you explain this inexplainable V-shaped responsibility?
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.180]   There's two things to keep in mind.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.960]   First of all, the economy is completely fucked.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   So don't look at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.860]   and a handful of internet SaaS companies and kid yourself.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.880]   We have 30 million American men and women out of work.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.560]   That is every fifth person you see walking down the street
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.460]   does not have a job.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.980]   What happens when lockdown ends?
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.040]   If the lockdown ends in June, as expected for most people,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.520]   how many people are-
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.420]   How many rebound?
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:13.760]   No.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.020]   So look, here's the thing that we've had.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.040]   We've had trillions of dollars of money printed into the system.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.760]   And when you print that money into the system,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.740]   which the Federal Reserve has done,
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.500]   it hits the asset markets
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   and it has basically stabilized the bond market
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.220]   and the incremental dollar sits in the hands of an individual
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.360]   who must put the money to work.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.940]   Because when you look back on this,
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.180]   this is not, you know,
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.220]   this is a random person managing their 401k.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.420]   The overwhelming majority of the money sits in the hands of hedge funds
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.660]   or pension funds or sovereign wealth funds or mutual funds.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.180]   They have a job to do.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.180]   And so you have to think about what is their incremental decision.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.800]   So even if the stock market made no sense on any valuation metric,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.540]   the incremental dollars that they have,
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.640]   which they're paid to put to work, will get put to work.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.780]   And so what you've actually seen is a dispersion.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.320]   And what I mean by that is if you graph,
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.700]   the S&P 500 index versus the unweighted S&P 500 index,
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.100]   which basically means the first one ranks companies by market cap
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.900]   and gives the biggest companies more weight.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.980]   The other one ranks every company equally.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.920]   There's been a massive split, a dispersion.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.320]   And what it really shows is that companies that traffic in bits,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.000]   so software businesses have a bid
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.580]   and companies that traffic in atoms have gotten completely decimated
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.220]   and they are literally worthless.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.220]   And so when you put all these things together,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.220]   the real economy is in the toilet.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   There are tens of millions of men and women out of work.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.220]   The earnings power of real companies that do physical things in the world
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.220]   are cheaper and lower than they've ever been.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.220]   Meanwhile, the companies that have high velocity,
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.220]   high margin software driven businesses have gone to the moon.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.220]   So it's unfair to look at 30 or 40 businesses that are going to be
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.220]   in the same business cycle as the rest of the world.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.220]   And so the real economy is in the toilet.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.220]   There are tens of millions of men and women out of work.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.220]   The earnings power of real companies that do physical things in the world
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.220]   are cheaper and lower than they've ever been.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.120]   Meanwhile, the companies that have high velocity, high margin,
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   and they're not going to be in the toilet.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   There are tens of millions of men and women out of work.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   There are tens of millions of women and women out of work.
