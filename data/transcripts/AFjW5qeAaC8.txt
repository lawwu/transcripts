[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   [Music]
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.200]   All right, speaking of deep, let's do some questions about the deep life.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   Sandy asks, "What were your thoughts on the Get Back documentary?"
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.300]   She elaborates, "I've been watching the Beatles Get Back documentary,
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.700]   and one thing that strikes me is the novelty of watching people just hanging out,
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.500]   playing with creative ideas and without distracting technology.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200]   I wondered if you have any thoughts on it.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   They spend a lot of time just hanging out, apparently not doing much.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.100]   Is this important if you want to be as creative as the Beatles were?
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700]   Do you think the lack of technology contributed to their brilliance?"
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500]   Yes.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500]   I think the answer is yes and yes.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.400]   Creative work requires
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.300]   a lot of deep work.
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.900]   So there's a lot of moments of just being able to be very comfortable,
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.600]   being very focused, but also a lot of what we can think of as cognitive wandering.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   It's the Beatles just hanging out, talking, messing around on their instruments,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.400]   noticing things, "Wait a second, let me try about that.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.200]   What if we did this?"
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   None of that can happen at a high level if you're constantly context switching.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.000]   Look at a text message thread, look at a WhatsApp thread,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.800]   look at social media to see what's going on.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.000]   I can give you a very specific case study
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.400]   from exactly this world.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.200]   A couple years ago, I was communicating with a very high-level songwriter.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.500]   So she's well-known and she works on songs for some pretty famous pop stars.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.600]   Not to spoil this for the kids out there, but unlike the Beatles, pop stars today
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.000]   don't write their own music.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.100]   Some do, but a lot of them don't.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200]   Anyways, she wrote me because she was having a real problem.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.500]   She was constantly on social media and she had told herself this story about
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.500]   people need to know who I am and promotion and it's going to help me get work.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.300]   But guess what was not happening?
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.900]   Songwriting.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.800]   She wasn't writing songs.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.700]   She was obsessed with posting, but did people like what I posted?
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.800]   What were people thinking about me?
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   What are other people doing?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500]   What's happening in the world of the related pop star celebrity?
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200]   And I talked to her and gave her some advice and said,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.900]   "Don't worry about people finding you, man.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.100]   What people worry about is are you writing killer hooks?"
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.600]   And she did pull back and it made all the difference.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.900]   She's like, "Man, I'm back into it again.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.000]   Like I just don't do this thing on my phone anymore."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800]   That's a direct example from this world.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.900]   You also see this all the time with novelists.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.200]   Novel writing is difficult, cognitively demanding work.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.500]   It is very difficult.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.900]   They don't mess around.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.700]   I mean, some do, but there are so many novelists that say, "I don't want to
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.500]   have anything to do with this stuff."
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.900]   You know, I go, I disappear.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.300]   I'm Dave Eggers where I have a writing house with no Wi-Fi on an old laptop
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.500]   with no internet connection and eight hours at a time, you can't get to me.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.900]   It's John Grisham who like the groundhog comes out of his Warren in the
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.400]   ground, you know, once a year to promote his book for two weeks and then
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.100]   disappears.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.900]   It's like, I don't want to have anything to do with that, right?
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.300]   This is like Aziz Ansari has a new comedy special out that I was watching
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.900]   the other day on the rowing machine and he uses a flip phone.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.200]   He's like, "This just was killing me.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.200]   And I'm supposed to create creative, interesting things and I can't if all
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.500]   I'm thinking about is what's happening on this little glowing piece of glass
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.100]   flip phone."
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.600]   You know, I'm sure he could be on Instagram and Twitter and trying to get
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.700]   an audience back and now he's like, "Forget it.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   I want to do this and I don't care if I'm less successful at it.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   I can't do creative work with this."
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.000]   So I think it's a good point, Sandy.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.100]   It's not compatible.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.300]   You know, Jesse, I hear this with sports too.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.300]   I've talked quite a bit of people within professional sports.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.500]   I've talked with general managers of NBA teams.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   I've talked with people at national rugby teams.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.800]   I've talked with people within football.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.400]   I've talked with golfers and this is like a real issue.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.200]   Is especially coaches and managers are very worried of the impact of the
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.600]   cognitive drain of looking at these things all the time on their athletes.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300]   And so it's another world.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.100]   So forget creative stuff.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.700]   What about physical, high concentration physical stuff?
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.100]   Phones kill you.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.100]   A lot of the coaches, general managers, they're on their phones all the time
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.400]   too.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.000]   Agents.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.700]   Well, the agents are part of the problem.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.200]   Because the agents are talking in one ear, especially the NBA is a real
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.900]   problem because these are the youngest athletes of any sport, right?
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.500]   It's the only sport where you can come out of high school into it, really,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.800]   right?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.700]   I mean, you're not, to play whatever, professional football, you got to
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.000]   grow, you know, and so typically you're going to come out of college for
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.400]   that.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.600]   Baseball, you have a, you're going to have this 10-year path of the
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.300]   minors before like anyone cares.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.700]   Basketball players, you could be 19 and on the national stage.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.600]   And the agents are in their ears.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.100]   People got to know, people got to know your brand, you know, you got to
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.700]   be on there.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   You got to be and they get on the court and it, they can't, it's not
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   that they can't play, but it is a, I've had, I had this conversation
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.800]   with a really high level person in the NBA.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.400]   At that level.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.900]   It is a game of Epsilons.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.000]   If you are 3% off of your peak, you're on the bench because everyone
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.700]   is fantastic and everyone is playing at their, their, their fullest
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.200]   extent.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.000]   There's really no room unless you're really, you know, Giannis or
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.400]   someone who has like a little bit of wiggle room here.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.900]   It makes a huge difference.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.000]   These agents are in their ear.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.700]   You got to be on your phone.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.500]   You got to be on their phone.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.600]   It, it destroys their concentration.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.400]   And then they're 5% worse and then they're out of the league in two
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.700]   years.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.100]   A lot of them start clothing lines too.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.100]   You know, Aziz Ansari talked about this in that special.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.200]   He's like, yeah, a lot of comedians I know, like have these other
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.600]   products and do these other things.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.700]   He's like, it kind of makes me feel like a slacker, but like, I just
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.300]   want to write.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.100]   I just want to write comedy.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   Basically, I saw a David Goggins video.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.500]   And he was talking about being in the gym at a hotel and like an NBA
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.200]   player came in with his coach and I forgot exactly.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.100]   It was a Goggins video.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.000]   So, you know, it was like really intense, but, but basically like
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.800]   the, the long and the short of it was like the NBA player was just
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.500]   going through the motions and the coach, the, and by coach, I mean
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.300]   trainer, not coach.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.600]   The trainer was like, let's do 15 reps, not 12.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.100]   And the players like, nah man, I'm just doing my 12.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   And Goggins went off on like, you know, not pushing yourself, whatever,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.300]   but that it's like an example of what happens when you have this
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.400]   pull from you coming from the phone is like you're doing the 12 reps
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.300]   instead of the 15.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.900]   It makes a difference when you're at a very high level.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.900]   So, yeah, I'm a big believer in that.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.000]   I think it's a huge, it's a huge competitive advantage.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.500]   Be the guy or the woman not on this stuff.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.400]   It's a big advantage.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.800]   Yeah, you're gonna produce better work.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.900]   Nothing matters more than producing better work, social media, and
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.100]   I don't mean to rant too much, but social media is great for spreading
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.900]   the word about you, but it's best when other people are doing it for
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.100]   you.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.000]   So yeah, you should be happy that social media exists.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.500]   If you're doing something awesome, because it makes it easy for
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.100]   people to talk about it, but they don't need you on there saying
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.600]   look at me.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.000]   That only helps a little bit.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.400]   So there we go.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   All right.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.600]   [Music]
