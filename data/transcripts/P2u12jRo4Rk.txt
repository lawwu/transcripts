[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100]   #Winning
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.860]   Global missions and personal evangelism is all about winning.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.480]   Winning is the word that Paul loves to use, as you can see in a text like 1 Corinthians
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.300]   chapter 9, verses 19-22.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.940]   There Paul wrote this, "For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.900]   all, that I might win more of them.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.820]   To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.120]   To those under the law I became as one under the law, though not being myself under the
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.960]   law, that I might win those under the law.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.640]   To those outside the law I became as one outside the law, not being outside the law of God
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.860]   but under the law of Christ, that I might win those outside the law.
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.100]   And to the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak."
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.140]   So what does Paul mean when he uses "win" five times in four verses?
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.660]   Here's Pastor John to explain Paul's word and why it matters for our evangelism today.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.580]   Now the word "win" in English is ambiguous.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.620]   You can win a prize, and you can win an argument.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.860]   What does Paul mean by "win"?
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.980]   Win all these people.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.660]   If you win a prize, you gain it.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660]   Got it.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660]   I have it.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660]   Mine.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.620]   If you win an argument, you defeat somebody.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.340]   What's Paul's meaning?
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.220]   There's no doubt what his meaning is.
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.700]   It's on the face of it, but it's even more clear in the original language.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.620]   He means I win a prize.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.300]   I gain a prize.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.300]   How do I know that?
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.140]   Well, it's just obvious from the context, I think, but test me on this, the hundreds
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.420]   of you who know your Greek.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.180]   "Kerdino" is the verb for "win."
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.460]   It's almost always, except for two places, here and one other place, it's almost always
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.500]   translated "gain," like Matthew 16, 26.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.380]   What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.740]   That's "kerdino," the word "win" here.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.340]   Or Philippians 3, 8.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.980]   I count everything as rubbish in order that I might gain Christ.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.860]   That's the word "win" here.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.260]   So his point is, I want to gain Jews.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.500]   I want to gain Gentiles.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.020]   I want to gain the weak.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.420]   I don't want to gain money.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.680]   I don't want to gain power and rights.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.100]   The gospel has assured me I get great gain in fully enjoying Christ.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.820]   So what can I add to that?
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.340]   More enjoyers of Christ for me to enjoy.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.940]   What does that even mean?
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.780]   And he tells us what he means by the reward of gaining people in verse 23.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.020]   All right, everybody looking down, unless you don't have a Bible.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:45.020]   "I do," 23, "I do it all for the sake of the gospel."
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.300]   Here comes the purpose statement, "that I may share with them," that is all those gained
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.020]   people that I gained, "that I may share with them in its blessings."
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:12.540]   So he wants to gain more and more people so that he might share in the gospel blessings
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.540]   with them.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.060]   Now, notice the wording carefully.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.780]   He does not say what I would expect him to say, and it would be true, "so that they can
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.500]   share with me in the gospel blessings."
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.100]   That's absolutely true, right?
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.580]   Missionaries go out to bring people to share with them in the gospel blessings.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.100]   That's not what he says.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:49.100]   He says, "that I may share with them in the blessings of the gospel."
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:59.300]   I want to gain people, all kinds of people, so that I can be a sharer with them as they
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.060]   enjoy gospel blessings.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.260]   That I might enjoy their enjoyment of Christ.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:21.540]   Now, what does that imply about the nature of joy in gospel blessings?
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.500]   What I mean by gospel blessings, forgiveness of sins, declaration of your righteousness
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.160]   before Christ, before God, removal of all condemnation, reconciliation with God, adoption
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.180]   into his family, fellowship with Christ, hope of eternal life?
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.500]   What does what Paul just said imply about my enjoyment of that?
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.940]   Those gospel blessings.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.060]   Here's what it implies.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:06.920]   Our gospel joy is authentic and satisfying only if we desire to taste this joy in the
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.760]   hearts of other people.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:21.440]   Our gospel joy in those blessings is authentic and satisfying only if we desire to taste
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:31.800]   those blessings and that joy in the hearts of other people as they experience those blessings.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.160]   I want to gain people.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.320]   I want to gain people of all kinds in order that I might share in their experience of
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.880]   gospel joy.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   Do you?
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.160]   Let me just pause here, because this is relevant for missionaries, it's relevant for every
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.960]   believer and I just have a little practical, earnest plea.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.760]   Most of you have shared the gospel with a dad or a mom or a brother or a sister or a
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.160]   son or a daughter or a roommate or a colleague or a friend or a stranger.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.360]   And if you've never done this, I really encourage you to do it.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:20.720]   The last time where the situation allows it, that is there's enough solitude and earnestness,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.760]   you sit down across the table at a restaurant and you look them in the eye and you say,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.080]   "I want you.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.640]   I really want you.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.840]   I want you to be my friend forever.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.460]   I want you to be my brother, my sister forever.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.720]   I want to gain you.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.440]   I want your joy to be my joy."
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.640]   Because they've never had anybody say that to them.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.920]   I mean, many people have explained the facts to them, right?
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.720]   How many people have looked into their eyes and said, "I want you.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.040]   I want you to come in.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040]   Be in my life.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   Be in my church.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040]   Be in my—forever."
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   That's, I think, what Paul was saying.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   I want to gain people.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.560]   I would just say right here to the unbelievers in the room, I want you.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.800]   I know about some of you.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.120]   We've had emails.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.660]   You're here.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.600]   You may still be resisting.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   And just hear John Piper say, "I want you forever.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.320]   My brother, my sister, my friend."
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.400]   I mean it.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.560]   Did you notice where I stopped in my list of people that he is trying to gain?
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.080]   You should have said, "Why did you stop there?"
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   Because there was another thing.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.360]   I stopped right in the middle of verse 22.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.760]   What did I leave out?
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.960]   Why did you do that?
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.920]   Let's pick it up in the middle of verse 22.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:03.320]   I have become all things to all people that I might—and he switches from win to save.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.560]   That I might save some.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.600]   What does save mean for Paul?
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.240]   I want to save people.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.440]   But he doesn't mean that he's the Savior.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.120]   He means he's the means of people's salvation.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.480]   What does he mean?
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.080]   Romans 5-9, "Since we are now justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved from
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   the wrath of God."
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   Or 1 Thessalonians 1-10, "Jesus saves us from the wrath to come."
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.880]   Being saved in biblical language means first and fundamentally—those are two important
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.000]   words—first and fundamentally.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.960]   There are other things it means, but first and fundamentally it means God, by means of
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:53.680]   the substitution of Christ bearing our condemnation, God saves us from God.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.200]   And if you don't get that, I don't know how you get the gospel at all.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.360]   We are saved by God from God.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:10.800]   We're saved by the love of God from the wrath of God, and Christ was sent by God to reconcile
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.000]   us to God and escape, lead us out of wrath.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:29.160]   Then, verse 23, right after 22, he says, "I want to share with them," those that I'm saving,
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:36.480]   "I want to share with them in their enjoyment of the gospel blessings."
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.800]   Meaning now, the reason I left it out so I could emphasize it now, now it means I want
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:49.240]   to share with what happens when they hear the verdict in the courtroom, not guilty,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.960]   and they run out of the courtroom and do handsprings down the sidewalk in front of the court saying,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.400]   "I'm not going to be executed!
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.760]   I'm not going to be killed!
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.960]   I'm not going to be spending eternity in hell!
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   I am free!"
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.040]   I want to be, Paul said, "I want to be there.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.720]   I want to share in that.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.880]   I want to watch that happen all over the world with Jews and Gentiles.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   Do you?
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.800]   If it only happens to one person in your life, it will be one of the sweetest moments of
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:28.640]   your life to have a person thank you and watch them come into the enjoyment of no condemnation
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.640]   forever."
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.080]   Amen and amen.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.440]   This clip was pulled from Pastor John's message at the Cross Conference in Louisville on February
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.840]   27, 2022.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.520]   The message is titled, "The Missionary Miracle."
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.040]   The Missionary Miracle.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.120]   A clip sent to us by David McClellan.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.360]   "Greetings, listeners," David writes.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.840]   I wanted to share this clip from Cross Conference in 2022 on Paul's motivation for winning souls
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   to Christ.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.200]   This sermon completely changed the way I viewed my own motivation for sharing the gospel with
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   the lost.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.360]   I have shared the gospel with more people in the past six months since hearing this sermon
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.000]   than I did in 12 years previous as a Christian.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.080]   So I wanted to share this clip to help others become emboldened to evangelize.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.680]   Thank you so much, Pastor John, for your faithful labors for our risen Savior."
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   Amen.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   Thank you, David, for that testimony.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.920]   Thank you for the clip.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.400]   And if you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.040]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.840]   the audio, and tell me what stands out to you.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.560]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.880]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.160]   I am your host, Tony Reinke, and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.920]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   Piper.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.480]   We'll see you next time.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:57.980]   Bye.
