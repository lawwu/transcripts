[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   In our consideration of the work of the Holy Spirit in the application of redemption, the
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.320]   redemption that has been worked out and purchased by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, we have
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.440]   arrived now at a consideration of the doctrine of the union of the believer with the Lord
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   Jesus Christ.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.320]   I was at pains in introducing this doctrine last Friday evening to emphasize the fact
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.920]   that it is a doctrine which of necessity must be taken always in conjunction with the doctrine
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200]   of regeneration.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.240]   The two things are in a sense almost simultaneous.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   Logically, the union should be put first, but not chronologically.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.840]   However, the two things of necessity must go together.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.320]   We are regenerated in a sense because of our union with Christ.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.360]   It is from him we derive our life; it is from him we derive everything.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.800]   And therefore we are looking together at one of the most glorious of all the doctrines
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.600]   of the Christian faith.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.560]   There is none which is more sublime than this, in which we are reminded that we really are
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.240]   made partakers of Christ, that we are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.520]   So it goes naturally and inevitably with the doctrine of regeneration.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.600]   Now last Friday, having given the reasons why this doctrine must come at this point
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.080]   and not at the end of a series of doctrines, we simply gave the scriptural terms which
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.740]   are used to describe the nature of the union.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.880]   The fundamental term is "in Christ," but there are others.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.880]   It is compared to a tree and its branches, to the head and the members of a body, to
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.440]   a husband and wife, to a building and the cornerstone.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.840]   And finally, it can be thought of by way of contrast to our union by nature, all of us
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   with Adam.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.440]   Well, now, we left it at that point, so we are in a position to proceed to a more detailed
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.240]   consideration of this doctrine this evening.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.120]   Now the first thing clearly to consider is the nature of the union.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.920]   What is the character or the nature of this union?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.600]   Now the very terms that are used in the Scriptures with respect to it, and of which I have just
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.060]   reminded you, in a sense give us the key to the understanding of the character, the nature
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060]   of the union.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.620]   But again, perhaps we had better start with a negative.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.080]   We must not think of this union between the believer and Christ as if it involved a kind
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.360]   of confusion of persons.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.380]   The union must not be thought of in the sense that our substance or the essence of our being
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.080]   becomes merged and lost in the substance or the essence of the being of our Lord.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.280]   Now I emphasize that again because of the teaching of the mystics.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   The mystics always tend to think of this union in terms of a blending of our being and our
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.760]   essence and our very substance.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.520]   Their conception ultimately of complete salvation is that we become lost in the eternal, that
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.400]   we become absorbed in the eternal.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.760]   Now you are familiar with that idea in certain Eastern religions, and there is a sort of
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.440]   kinship between a great deal of mysticism that often goes by the name of Christian with
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.880]   that more general mysticism that characterizes those Eastern religions, and in all of them.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   That is their idea of what they call nirvana.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.640]   You become lost, you go out of existence altogether by being absorbed into the divine and into
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   the eternal.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.820]   Now, I am saying that the scriptural doctrine of the union of the believer with Christ does
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.260]   not mean that at all.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.880]   The scripture teaches very clearly that you and I will exist as entities and as individuals
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.380]   throughout the countless ages of eternity.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.480]   We do not become lost and absorbed in God.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.680]   We ourselves as persons will not only always be and exist, but we shall enjoy the beatific
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.200]   vision, we shall enjoy seeing God, and we shall enjoy being in his glorious presence.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.680]   We do not become lost or merged or disappear thus even in the eternal essence.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.720]   Now, that is a very important doctrine, as you can see.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.580]   You remember that in considering the doctrine of the person of our Lord, we had to emphasize
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.160]   exactly the same thing.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.520]   The two natures in our Lord are separate and distinct, but they are joined.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.600]   There is not a new nature which is partly human and partly divine.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.280]   No, he is God, he is man, he is divine, he is human, and the two remain separate and
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   yet they are together.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.360]   They are not intermingled, they are not fused in that materialistic sense.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:53.040]   So the union of the believer and his Lord must likewise not be thought of in terms of
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.200]   a confusion or intermingling of substance.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:05.320]   But on the other hand, I am equally anxious to stress another negative, which is this,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.920]   that the union between the believer and Christ is not merely a union of sympathy or a union
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   of interest.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:25.360]   It is not merely a loose general association of separate persons who happen to have the
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.000]   same interest or the same enthusiasm, if you like.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.040]   Now, that again is very important, because there are some who, in their anxiety to avoid
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.520]   the errors of mysticism, have represented this union as merely being some kind of general
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.960]   external sympathetic union of interests.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.640]   You know what I mean by that.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.360]   You can have people joining together to form societies.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.840]   They may be interested in music or in some particular musician, so you have a Beethoven
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.480]   society or a Mozart society and so on.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.040]   Or people may have an interest in art and they will form a society.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.520]   They have got a common interest and that brings them together and they call it a union.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.800]   Well, of course, in a sense it is a union.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.720]   But my point is that that is not the union that binds together the Lord and any one of
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.000]   us his followers.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   It is not merely that we are interested in salvation.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.040]   It is not merely that we are interested together in God and in his kingdom.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.680]   We are, but the union is much bigger and much deeper than that.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.240]   So we are anxious to emphasize those two negatives, though they happen to be at opposite extremes
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   from one another.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.640]   Very well, then, what is the nature and the character of the union positively?
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.800]   The first thing we have to say here is that it is a spiritual union.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:00.200]   Now, this is where the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, of course, is so vitally important.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:08.320]   We are joined to Christ and we are in union with him by means of the indwelling of the
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.200]   Holy Spirit in us.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.280]   It is the function, the work, the special work of the Holy Spirit to join us thus to
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.220]   Christ.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.840]   And we are joined to Christ by his presence in us.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.280]   So I say that it is a spiritual union.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.760]   Now, let me give you some scriptures to substantiate and to support that.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   Take, for instance, the statement in 1 Corinthians 6.17.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.340]   "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.800]   You remember the context, don't you?
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.560]   The apostle is reminding the Corinthians that their bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.040]   and that that is why they must avoid certain sins of the flesh.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.240]   He says, "He that is joined to a harlot is one body with that harlot."
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.360]   Now, he puts the opposite, and here it is.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.820]   So it is a spiritual union.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.680]   Not a materialistic conception, a spiritual union.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:22.320]   Or take again 1 Corinthians 12.13, "For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.160]   and have all been made to drink into one spirit."
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.560]   Same idea again.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:36.360]   Therefore we think of it primarily as a spiritual union, not merely a union of spirits, but
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:44.200]   we are joined to him in this amazing and mysterious manner by the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.440]   Let me give you a second term.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   The second term is that it is a mystical union.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.160]   Now, this is a very difficult term.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.720]   What do we mean by a mystical union?
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.680]   Well, the best way to explain that, surely, is to take that comparison which the apostle
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.000]   himself uses in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.240]   That last portion of that chapter, which is sometimes read that marriage service is, and
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.020]   rightly so.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:24.400]   And certain orders of service tell us that the relationship between a husband and a wife
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:32.120]   signifies unto us the mystical union that is between Christ and his Church.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.880]   And certainly there in that fifth chapter of Ephesians, the apostle does say that the
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:45.120]   union between the Lord and myself is comparable to and similar to the union between a husband
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   and a wife.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.640]   Now, that is what I mean by a mystical union.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.200]   What is the union between a husband and a wife?
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.720]   It is very difficult to put this in terms.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:03.200]   Now, the union between Christ and the believer is similar to that.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:10.880]   There is a union, and you cannot find a better term for describing it than this term, mystical.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.080]   Not only are the two made one flesh, but they are bound together in another manner and in
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.080]   an intimate manner.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.000]   And the two rarely become one, a mystical union.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.320]   Then the next way of describing the union is to say that it is a vital union.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.440]   And this is obviously of the greatest importance.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:41.600]   What I mean by saying that it is a vital union is this, that our spiritual life is drawn
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.560]   from the Lord Jesus Christ directly.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.720]   It is a vital union.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:59.280]   We draw our life from him, indeed we are sustained by him through the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.840]   There is nothing more important, I think, in the Christian life than to realize this,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.120]   that our union with him is a vital one.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.920]   I mean by that that it is a living thing.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.320]   There is life in it.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.400]   It is not something mechanical, it is not something conceptual, it is not a thought,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.680]   it is not a concept, it is not an idea.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   It is really a vital spiritual union.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.080]   Now take some of those statements of Scripture which demonstrate that.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   Take that great statement immediately in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:36.840]   John in verse 60, one of the most amazing and marvelous statements in Holy Writ, "And
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.720]   of his fullness of all we received, and grace for grace."
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.080]   That says it all.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.100]   That is our relationship to him, says John.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:57.080]   We have received and we are receiving of his fullness.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.040]   Something of his fullness and of his life is passing into us and we are receiving it.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040]   That is it.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.920]   It is a vital relationship.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.800]   But there are many other statements which say the same thing.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:18.600]   Take John 14 verses 19 and 20, where our Lord says in this very connection, "Because I
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.640]   live, ye shall live also.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:31.000]   At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.260]   There it is once more.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:38.760]   You see how vital a relationship it is, and all because of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:49.080]   Or again take John 17 verses 22 and 23, "That they may be one, even as we are one, I in
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.320]   them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one."
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.600]   What sublime teaching!
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.080]   My dear friends, the trouble with all of us is that we do not realize the truth of these
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.920]   things.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.080]   But this is the truth given by the Lord himself.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:15.040]   It is his prayer for his people that they may know the meaning of this vital relationship,
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.560]   this vital spiritual relationship.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.920]   And he does not hesitate to compare it with the relationship that subsists between the
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.240]   Father and himself.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.160]   As the Father is in him, so he is in us and we are in him.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.280]   It is a vital spiritual relationship.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:39.000]   But take the statement of it which is made by the Apostle Paul in Galatians 2.20, "I
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.480]   am crucified with Christ.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:51.800]   Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.280]   There is nothing greater than that.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:01.600]   What he does teach is that this is a vital relationship, a life-giving relationship,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.080]   a relationship of life.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.800]   It is a union of life.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.640]   Not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.320]   Then he goes on, "You remember the life I now live, in the flesh I live, by the faith
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.760]   of the Son of God who loved me and who gave himself for me."
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:27.560]   Very well, the next term, therefore, that I must use is the term "organic."
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:35.080]   Now the difference between organic and vital is in a sense just this, that the term "organic"
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:43.360]   suggests, if I may use a current phrase, that it is a kind of two-way traffic, that it is
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.440]   a union of a type in which we give as well as receive.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.960]   Now the statement of this, the best statement of this in many ways, is the one that is to
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.760]   be found in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.320]   Let me read to you first of all verses 15 and 16.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:09.280]   But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the head,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:18.560]   in Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:26.640]   every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.760]   increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.080]   What a statement!
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.860]   But you see how it brings out this organic element.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.640]   We are to grow up into him who is the head.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.320]   Yes, but you notice that it is said that the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.960]   by that which every joint supplieth.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.160]   So that we don't only receive, we also give.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.640]   Every part of the body is playing a vital part in the life of the body, not only the
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.720]   head.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.360]   We are not simply passive.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.620]   It is an organic relationship, it is an organic union.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.820]   And there is an activity and a vitality in the parts as well as in the head.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.200]   And they all make their contribution.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.040]   Now that is the conception of the Church as the body of Christ.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.960]   And we all are active members in it, we are all in an organic relationship, so we are
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.680]   all making our contribution.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.160]   It is a tremendous idea.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.080]   There is nothing, surely, that should be more stimulating to our faith, nothing more encouraging,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.640]   nothing more stimulating to our practical holiness, than to realize this wonderful and
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.360]   exalted truth about ourselves.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:47.200]   I say once more that I am more and more convinced that what accounts chiefly for the low state
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:53.680]   of spirituality in the Christian Church is the failure to grasp these doctrines.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.200]   We are thinking so much in subjective terms and we spend so much time in trying to work
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.440]   up something.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.840]   The way to become holy is to understand the truth about ourselves and to realize our high
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.720]   calling and our privileged position.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.000]   Here it is.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.360]   Very well, the other statement of the organic nature of the union is again that same passage
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.160]   in the fifth chapter of Ephesians, where he compares it to the relationship between the
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.800]   husband and the wife.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.440]   Each has his duties, or her duties, each has a separate function.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.240]   But in the union, the two play their part, and that is the relationship between Christ
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.360]   and the Church.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.040]   We have our part to play, our lot to contribute, as well as the great head himself.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.600]   It is an organic union.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.320]   The next term I would bring forward is the term "personal."
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.400]   It is a personal union.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.440]   Now I use that in order to say this.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:03.360]   It is the way of emphasizing that every one of us, separately, is in union with Christ.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.720]   Now this needs to be emphasized today because there is a teaching, very popular, and very
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:16.360]   popular amongst all types and kinds of Catholics, not only Roman Catholics but Anglo-Catholics.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.840]   And indeed, I notice it is insinuating itself into those who like to call themselves liberal
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.240]   evangelicals.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:33.600]   And what it teaches is this, that we have no direct union individually with our Lord,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.520]   but that we are only connected to him through the Church.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.040]   They do away with the individual aspect; it is the corporate aspect.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.880]   Indeed, therefore, you see, they go on to say that in a sense we cannot be born again
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.360]   except in and through the Church, which is a complete denial not only of the scriptural
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.680]   teaching but particularly of the evangelical emphasis.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:02.120]   The evangelical emphasis is that we all have personal dealings and relationships, and it
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.280]   is only because of that we are members of the body.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.520]   Of course, in a sense you cannot separate these things.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.680]   But what I am anxious to say is this, that I do not derive my life from the Church, I
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.400]   derive my life from the Lord.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.160]   And because we all do at the same time, we are all members of his body and we are all
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.360]   in the Church.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.520]   You cannot be a Christian without being a member of the mystical body of Christ.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.480]   But I say that if you put these things in the right order, you put the personal and
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.440]   individual first and the corporate second.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.000]   So that I am not born of the Church.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.640]   The Church is not my spiritual mother; I am born of the Spirit.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:49.200]   And the moment I am, I am in the Church, the unseen, the mystical Church.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.520]   So let us emphasize the personal aspect and the individual aspect.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.600]   And let us make certain that we will never allow any specious teaching to rob us of that
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.040]   individual and that personal element.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.500]   We do not have to go to him through the Church.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.440]   We can go to him one by one, and we are united to him singly and individually as well as
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.740]   in a corporate manner.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.640]   My last term is this, to say that it is an indissoluble union.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.580]   I need not emphasize that.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:27.520]   It follows of necessity from everything we have been saying together for many weeks past.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.660]   It is an indissoluble union.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:38.660]   It is inconceivable to me that we can be joined to Christ in this way by the Spirit and then
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.280]   go out of that union and then come back and enter into it again and then go out again
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.080]   and keep on coming in and going out.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.320]   This is once and forever.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:54.880]   Nothing, no one, neither things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.840]   any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.440]   Jesus our Lord.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.640]   It is an indissoluble union.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.920]   Thank God for it.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.760]   Very well, let us go on then now to consider how the union is established.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:21.000]   If that is the nature and the character of the union, how is it brought about?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.160]   How is the union brought into being?
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:31.440]   Clearly we are face to face here with a very great mystery, and we must tread carefully.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.160]   But at any rate we can say that there are two main elements involved.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:43.200]   First and foremost it is clearly the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.760]   Ephesians 2.5 puts it like this.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:53.400]   It says that he hath quickened us together with Christ.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.800]   That is it.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.360]   That is the work of the Spirit.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.760]   It is his work to quicken us.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.200]   We have already looked at that.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.720]   And he quickens us together with Christ.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.260]   There is the union.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:12.400]   So the main work is the work that is done by the Holy Spirit in our regeneration and
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.960]   in all that we have been talking about, and in the effectual call and so on.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.600]   But then we must also emphasise this aspect.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.880]   As the result of that, our faith comes into operation.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   And our faith is a very vital part of the union.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.760]   It is not the first thing, it is the second thing.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.340]   But it will lead us on to the consideration of the biblical doctrine of faith, quite inevitably
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.460]   as you can see.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.680]   Our faith helps to sustain the union, and to develop the union, and to strengthen the
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:54.420]   union, the union that is primarily established as the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:01.780]   Now, of course, it is only as faith becomes active that we become aware of this union,
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:07.900]   and we become aware of our regeneration, and all the other things that we have been considering.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.740]   It is only as our faith comes into operation that we rejoice in it, and we desire it more
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.460]   and more.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.340]   So that you will find in the Scripture, as the doctrine deals with the union of the believer
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:24.000]   with his Lord, the element of faith is of necessity emphasised.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.940]   It must be.
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:32.220]   The Spirit establishes it, leads the faith, and faith, as it were, desires it more and
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.700]   more, and keeps it going.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:42.460]   So we eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, and as we do so, the union between us becomes
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.860]   closer and purer and deeper.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:51.940]   Faith draws on his fullness more and more, and the more we realise the truth about the
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.500]   union, the more we shall draw upon him.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.500]   You see the difficulty of establishing an exact chronological order in these things.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   Indeed, it is almost impossible.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.300]   But that is the way in which the union is established and maintained.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:15.500]   But again, let us be careful about our negatives in this section also.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:22.740]   We must be clear, again to repeat under this heading, that the union is not established
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.020]   by the Church or through the Church.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:32.380]   You notice how the Roman Catholics would teach that without Mother Church you can never be
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.100]   born at all, you can never become a Christian.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.080]   The Church is absolutely essential at that point.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.620]   We deny that strenuously.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.580]   There is nothing to indicate it in the Scriptures.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:50.180]   And equally we must be at pains to emphasise that the union is not established by the sacraments
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.580]   either.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.300]   This union is not established by baptism.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.060]   Let us emphasise that.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.660]   We do not believe in baptismal regeneration in any shape or form.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:11.220]   This union is not brought into being by baptism, nor by the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.140]   Both these sacraments can be invaluable in maintaining the union and in stimulating our
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.940]   desire that the union may be deeper and greater.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.140]   But they do not bring it into being.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:29.220]   Now again you are familiar with that false sacramental teaching, which would have us
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:37.100]   believe that the grace is transmitted actually in the water, or actually in the bread or
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.620]   in the wine, mechanically.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:46.820]   And that these sacraments act—I must use the technical term, I am sorry, but it is
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:52.100]   used so frequently that it is good that we should all be familiar with it—ex opere
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:57.660]   operato, which means this, that it acts and operates in and of itself.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.080]   We deny that completely.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.220]   There is no value in the sacraments as such except to our faith.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.060]   Without our faith there is nothing in the sacraments.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:13.300]   So that by christening or baptizing an infant you do not transmit this life to it and you
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.700]   do not join it to Christ.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.180]   No, it is impossible.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.340]   Nowhere do you find that conception in the scriptures.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.620]   And we must resist the teaching, I say, in a most cunnivous manner.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.300]   Well, very well, that is the way in which the union is established.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:36.220]   That brings me to something in which we should all delight and for which we should praise
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:41.780]   God, the consequences of the union.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.860]   What a glorious subject this is.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.740]   It is an endless subject.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.740]   It should be always the great theme of preaching to believers.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:59.540]   And yet how infrequently do we do so and how infrequently is it done, the consequences
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.260]   of the union of the believer with his Lord.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.960]   Now we can subdivide this, fortunately, into two main headings.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.900]   You can think of this objectively and you can think of it subjectively.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.840]   Or, let me give you parallel terms.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.720]   Put by the side of objective, federal.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.180]   Put by the side of subjective, spiritual.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.900]   Now let us just glance at these things.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:37.220]   I cannot do anything more tonight than just give you a list.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:42.980]   When we come to deal with the doctrine of sanctification, I trust we shall be able to
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.340]   elaborate some of these things.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:52.100]   But let us try and look at it tonight as a whole, that we may see something of the meaning
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:59.420]   of our union with Christ and what it of necessity means with regard to us.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.660]   Here are some of the things which are taught in the scripture.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.140]   Take the federal and the objective first.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.380]   And we must start with that.
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.560]   I am almost tempted to stop there and digress.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.200]   We must always put the objective before the subjective.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.580]   We do not like doing that, of course.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.700]   We are all interested in the subjective.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.020]   We want the feeling or the experience.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.520]   And we are so concerned about that that we are not careful about the grounds.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.460]   And the result is that as our feelings come and go, we become unhappy because we have
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.740]   not based it on the objective truth.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:39.220]   Here is the objective, therefore which is also the federal.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.700]   Now what I mean by these terms is this.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:51.100]   There are certain things that result, we are told, from our union with our Lord, quite
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.760]   outside the realm of our experience.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:59.560]   They apply to our status, our standing, our position.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.660]   Now this term "federal" is the term that Paul has in his mind, of course, in that fifth
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.780]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans that we read together at the beginning.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:16.100]   We by nature, all of us, were joined federally to Adam.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.860]   God made Adam the representative of men.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.120]   He is the federal head.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.260]   Take the illustration of the United States of America.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.180]   That country consists of a number of different states.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:38.060]   And each particular state has its own legislature and its own government, in a sense.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:43.560]   But then in addition to that, there is what they call the federal government, which includes
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   them all.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.360]   They are all related in this federal union.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.760]   Now then, the teaching of the scripture is that the whole of mankind is in that kind
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.320]   of federal union with Adam.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.680]   And it was because of that that Adam's sin is imputed to us.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.920]   Because we are joined to Adam federally, in this legal sense, what he does applies to
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   us.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   He sinned, we sinned.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.620]   He fell, we fell.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:19.660]   That is the doctrine of original sin and original guilt.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:26.540]   But now we are told on the other side, and you notice the parallelism in the teaching,
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:32.820]   that we were Christians, we are in that precise relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.700]   We are federally related to him.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.700]   What does that mean?
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.720]   Well, here is what it means.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.180]   We have been crucified with him.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:48.780]   Now, don't interpret that verse, the sixth verse of Romans, in a subjective or experimental
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.780]   sense.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.780]   It isn't.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.020]   It is objective.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:59.080]   What it says is this, that because I am joined to Christ federally, when he was crucified,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.100]   I was crucified.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.980]   That is a statement of fact.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.700]   God regards it like that.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.420]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:15.260]   Not only that, we are told that we have been planted together in the likeness of his death.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.940]   That is Romans 6.5.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:27.020]   Crucified with him, planted in the likeness of his death, Romans 6.8, dead with Christ.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.980]   We have died with him, we are dead with him.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:36.100]   More, buried with him by baptism unto death, Romans 6.4.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:44.220]   Also in Romans 6.11, risen with him, and alive with him, and to God.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:51.060]   Now all these things are true of all of us who are Christians, all of us who are in Christ.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:58.100]   Because of this federal relationship, I must believe that I have been crucified with him.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:04.340]   In exactly the same way when Adam sinned, I sinned, when Christ was crucified, I was
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:10.900]   crucified, and all the other steps, crucified, planted together in the likeness of his death,
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:16.220]   dead with him, buried with him, risen with him, and go on to the sixth verse of the second
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:23.500]   of Ephesians, and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.260]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.500]   Now he is not talking there about something that is going to happen to us.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:37.820]   What Paul says there in Ephesians 2.6 is that federally and in terms of this relationship,
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:44.820]   we were Christian, are seated with him there in the heavenly places now.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:51.300]   Though we are still on earth in Christ, we are seated in the heavenly places.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   There are some of the federal consequences.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.120]   But wait, I haven't finished.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.860]   We are told that we are complete in him, who is the head.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:06.660]   That's obviously, again, a federal statement, a legal statement, or if you like the other
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.060]   term, a forensic statement.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:17.620]   I'm sure that there's nobody in this congregation, in this service at this moment, who feels
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.380]   that all this is bewildering and baffling.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.620]   My dear friends, I'm telling you the greatest things you'll ever hear.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.420]   I'm telling you the truth about yourself and about myself, thank God.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.220]   Don't be stumbled at these terms.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.340]   These are the scriptural statements.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.340]   Are they difficult?
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.220]   Of course they're difficult.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.360]   But anything worth having is difficult.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.540]   And if you're not interested in it because it's difficult, I say you better make sure
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.060]   that you're a Christian at all.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.860]   We are seated in the heavenly places.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.900]   We are complete in him.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.460]   Listen again.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:03.260]   God hath made him, says the apostle in 1 Corinthians 1.30, "Who of God is made unto
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:10.220]   us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption."
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.140]   Already that's happened.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.940]   I am already redeemed in Christ, finally.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.740]   Of course, actually and experimentally it hasn't all been worked out.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.940]   But I am already finally redeemed in him.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:31.220]   That's why in the 8th of Romans, you remember, he jumps from justification to glorification
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.340]   and says that those who have been called have already been glorified.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:40.660]   That is why I said just now that the union is indissoluble.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.940]   But let's hold on to these things one by one.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:52.020]   He is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.820]   You see, what this teaching really says is something like this.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:02.020]   Our sins were imputed to him.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.380]   His righteousness is imputed to me.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.820]   When we come to the doctrine of justification, I shall elaborate that.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:15.540]   But that's what it means at this point, that all that is in him is put to my account because
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.460]   of our union.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.180]   The next thing, therefore, I must emphasize is that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.820]   because of our union with him.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.260]   It is by the sealing, in a sense, that the union comes about, but the thing is separate.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.640]   Because I am joined to him, I am sealed by the Spirit.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:41.940]   It is because I am one with him, I receive the Spirit, which he received without measure.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:47.620]   The next consequence of this union is that we receive the adoption.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.620]   That's a separate doctrine, and I hope to come on to deal with that, the doctrine of
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.860]   our adoption.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.740]   The union of the believer with Christ is not the same thing as the adoption, as we shall
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   see.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:02.300]   But the adoption is one of the consequences of the union.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.740]   And the last thing that I mention is this.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.340]   Because we are adopted—you remember Paul argues again in the Eighth of Romans—we
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:18.820]   are heirs of God and therefore joint heirs with Christ.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.740]   Obviously because of the union.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.220]   He is an heir, we must be joint heirs.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:30.660]   And we are joint heirs of the glory which God hath prepared for them that love him.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:38.540]   Now there in that list I have been giving you the federal and the objective results
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.660]   of our union with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:51.820]   Shall I just give you the list of the vital, subjective, and spiritual results?
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.940]   I don't want to rush this, and yet perhaps I can just give you something of the list.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:02.480]   It all really means our fellowship with him.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.300]   That is a term that includes it all.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.980]   You'll see that elaborated in the 17th of John.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.580]   You'll see it elaborated in the first epistle of John.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.140]   Again you get it in John 1, verse 16, "of his fullness of all we received, and grace
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.740]   upon grace."
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.540]   What else does it mean?
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.580]   Well, it means this also.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:33.140]   In 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18, we are told, "being transformed into his image"—being
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:40.660]   made conformable into his image, if you like—"changed from glory unto glory."
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.500]   What a conception.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:49.500]   Because we are like him, because we are joined to him, we become like him.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.980]   That is the purpose of salvation, to make us conformable unto the image of God's
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.860]   dear Son.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:03.220]   And as we are joined to him and as we look at him with unveiled face, we become changed
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.460]   into his image, from glory to glory.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.180]   That's the Christian life.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.820]   That is what is happening to all of us.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.780]   That is what must happen to all of us if we are truly Christian.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.860]   We are not static.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:24.420]   We are changed from glory to glory, as we look at him and because we are joined to him.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.980]   It refers, of course, to our likeness to him in his human nature.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:35.900]   It doesn't mean that we become divine, but we do become as he was, living in this world.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.680]   We become like God's dear Son.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:44.020]   He is the firstborn among many brethren in that respect.
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:49.780]   And then, of course, it has the consequence that we bear fruit and become usable.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:55.260]   That is the great teaching of John 15.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.300]   Because we have branches in the vine, we bear fruit and we become usable.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:07.420]   And then the last thing that I would emphasize is our fellowship in his sufferings and our
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.700]   fellowship even in his death.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:16.820]   That I might know him, says Paul in Philippians 3, 10 and 11, that I might know him and the
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:24.420]   power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.380]   his death.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.500]   What great thoughts!
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.700]   We must work them out, think them out, and pray them out.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:38.500]   Another way, he says that in Colossians 1, 24, is this, "Who now rejoice in my sufferings
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:47.660]   for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:52.380]   his body's sake, which is the church."
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.780]   I don't pretend to understand that fully, but I do know this, that there is no higher
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.240]   statement of the doctrine of the union of the believer with his Lord.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.260]   The apostle interprets his own sufferings in the flesh and in the body as, in a sense,
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:16.740]   filling up what remains or is left behind of the sufferings and the affliction of Christ
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.740]   himself.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.220]   He is bearing that in his own flesh.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:25.780]   The result of the union, the mystical union, in other words, is that he enters into this
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:31.660]   mystical fellowship of the sufferings of Christ.
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:40.100]   There were people living in the Middle Ages of whom it is said that they so meditated
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.780]   upon and contemplated their Lord and all that he had done for them that some of them even
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:54.820]   developed in their literal physical hands the imprint of nails, the stigmata.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.820]   I don't know.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.660]   It is not impossible.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.580]   Such things do happen.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:08.140]   But all I am concerned to emphasize is this, that the more deeply we realize the truth
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:14.780]   about this union between us and our Lord, the more we shall know something of the fellowship
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.340]   of his suffering.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.860]   He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief in this world.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.700]   That was because of the sin of the world.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.740]   And because he saw the enmity of the human heart against his Father, it pained him, it
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.300]   hurt him, it grieved him.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:41.500]   He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and he suffered.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:49.540]   There is no more delicate test of our relationship to him and our union with him than the extent
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.380]   to which you and I know something about this suffering.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.940]   It isn't a glib talking about wanting souls to be saved.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.940]   No, no.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.500]   It is much deeper than that.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.540]   That can be purely carnal.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.100]   But this is something that is always spiritual.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:13.420]   That we really suffer in spirit because of the sin of men and their lost condition.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:21.860]   We may know something of groaning in the spirit as he knew it because of our union with him.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:31.940]   This deep concern, this pain, this agony of soul, it is one of the consequences, the subjective
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:39.220]   consequences of our union with our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:46.100]   May God through the Holy Spirit open our eyes to this wondrous doctrine of the union of
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:54.140]   the believer with his Lord, and may we be at great pains to work it out in detail, to
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:59.740]   apply it to ourselves, to tell ourselves, "I am crucified with him.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.780]   I am planted in the likeness of his death.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.060]   I have died with him.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.300]   I have been buried with him.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.660]   I have risen with him.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.140]   I am seated in the heavenly places with him.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.260]   That's my position.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:18.580]   It is true of me because I am in Christ and joined to him."
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   Let us pray.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:30.100]   Oh, our heavenly Father, we pray thee and beseech thee to forgive us for our slowness
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.660]   to believe and to accept thy word and its teaching.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.340]   Forgive us our laziness.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:42.820]   We realize, oh God, we have read these things so many times in our lives, and yet we are
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.380]   so slow to grasp and to realize them.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:55.820]   Oh, God, help us to reckon these things in our own daily lives and living.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:01.740]   By thy Spirit we pray thee, so display them to us that our hearts shall be entrenched
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.820]   and enraptured and we shall dwell upon them.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.780]   Teach us, oh God, to meditate.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.660]   Forgive us all for our busyness.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.780]   Teach us, oh God, as thy saints of old did, to meditate upon the truth.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.860]   Give us, oh God, a stillness of mind and of heart.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:32.180]   Brighten our fevered, hurried spirits that we may dwell upon these things and rejoice
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.180]   in them.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:40.100]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:47.900]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.560]   Amen.
