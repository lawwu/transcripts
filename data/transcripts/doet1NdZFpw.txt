[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.480]   - The Bible is full of about 20 major themes
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.400]   and another 50 to 70 smaller themes,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.000]   themes you really must grasp
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   in order to make sense of the whole Bible.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.320]   And we're walking through the biggies on this podcast
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.460]   and when it comes to explaining how each theme develops
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.200]   from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.520]   I don't know of anyone who does it better
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.120]   than Dr. Don Carson.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.840]   On select Fridays like today,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320]   we release a little longer episode than normal
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.480]   where we call up Dr. Carson.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.640]   He takes up one theme and explains it.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.160]   And six times we've covered one of the major themes
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.560]   of the Bible with him.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.160]   And you can find all of those episodes,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.320]   just search for his last name, Carson, in the APJ app.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.680]   He joins us again today over the phone
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.160]   fruit of our partnership with our friends
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.240]   at the Gospel Coalition.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.480]   Carson is the co-founder and president
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.400]   of the Gospel Coalition and also the editor
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   of the NIV Zondervan Study Bible,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.520]   which is sort of the study Bible version
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240]   of what we're doing in these podcasts.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.840]   There is one theme and if you get it wrong,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.520]   it will make an utter mess of the entire Bible
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.600]   and it's the theme of God's wrath on sin.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.400]   Sin is the theme we looked at last time
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.200]   with him in episode 858.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.740]   But today we turn and look at what God's wrath is
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.160]   and what it isn't.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.960]   So I called Dr. Carson at his home office
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.800]   and this is what he said.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.720]   - I suppose there are few theological topics
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.760]   that are more unacceptable to the contemporary
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.680]   Western world than the theme of the wrath of God.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.080]   The fact remains that the wrath of God
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.240]   is spoken of something like 600 times
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.840]   directly or indirectly in the Old Testament alone,
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   quite apart from New Testament usages.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.840]   And that is in addition to passages
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   where the expression the wrath of God
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.320]   or anything analogous is not actually found,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.160]   but the narrative carries the same theme.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.760]   For example, in Genesis 3,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.960]   the occasion of the first human sin,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.900]   there is no mention of the wrath of God,
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.720]   but God promises judgment in chapter two,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.640]   if they eat the forbidden fruit,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.320]   the judgment begins to be carried out in chapter three
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.080]   and is carried out further.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   This is a narrative telling of the wrath of God.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.320]   And there are many passages of that order.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.000]   And it's really important early on to establish then
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.720]   that the judgments that fall on the human race
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.760]   are not simply the automatic,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   but entirely impersonal consequences of bad behavior.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800]   If you do bad things, bad stuff happens to you
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.360]   in some sort of mechanistic way,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.600]   karma or something of that order,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.760]   but rather that there is personal offense
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.880]   against the personal God who made us.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   And his reaction against us is to bring judgment.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   And that is a function of his judicial wrath.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.680]   Already we see then that wrath is not bad temper.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.440]   It's not as if he's losing it,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.800]   but it is a function of his holiness.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   And if he were entirely unwrothful
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.120]   in that understanding of wrath,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.640]   then there would be no judgment
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.920]   and no consequence for sin of any sort.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.680]   And that doesn't make God out to be more attractive
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.240]   or more holy, it makes him out to be morally indifferent.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.240]   That is already established in Nuce,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.680]   in seed form in the opening chapters of Genesis.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.920]   There are so many, many biblical theological themes
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   that are beginning to appear in Genesis 1, 2, and 3,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.820]   and that are not developed and articulated until much later.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.960]   Then you find the same development in the Genesis storyline.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.560]   The judgment of the flood is a function of the wrath of God.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.400]   And the way even the Abrahamic family,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.460]   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the patriarchs and so on,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.840]   face various judgments from God
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.240]   because of their failures, inconsistencies, and sins,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.800]   along with the mercy of God,
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.520]   and that God preserves them,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.000]   brings them down to Egypt to make sure
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.520]   they have enough food and so on.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.600]   And that pattern continues all the way,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.440]   for example, to the exile,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.680]   when first the northern tribes, about 721,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.360]   and then the southern two tribes,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.560]   Judah and Simeon in 586,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.360]   their leadership is carried off into exile,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.480]   the former to the Assyrian Empire,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.720]   the latter to the Babylonian Empire.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.560]   And yet texts make it clear again and again and again
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.320]   that this doesn't happen
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.960]   because the Babylonians are too strong for God.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.680]   It's not as if the regional superpower controls events.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.720]   But for example, in the prophecy of Ezekiel,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.640]   we see how in a vision in chapters eight and following,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.480]   God judicially abandons the temple.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.960]   There is so much idolatry and so much sin going on
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.680]   that the glory of God leaves the temple,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.800]   sits on the mobile throne chariot,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.560]   the throne chariot abandons the city,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   crosses the Kidron Valley,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   rises to the top of the Mount of Olives,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.920]   and waits for the city to be destroyed.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.240]   All of that is a symbol-laden way of saying
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.920]   that if Jerusalem falls,
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.160]   it falls not because the Babylonians are such a mighty power
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.480]   that even God can't stop them,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.240]   but that the Babylonians win in the last analysis
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.040]   simply because God, in his wrath,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.540]   though the word is rarely used in that connection,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.240]   is judicially frowning upon Judah and Jerusalem.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.000]   He is bringing the promised judgment
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.480]   that he had been threatening them with for generations.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   It's finally come.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.520]   And the same thing is at the heart
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.120]   of the opening chapters of Romans.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.160]   Before you get to the great atonement passage
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.800]   in Romans chapter three, verses 21 to 26,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.360]   you read from 118,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.100]   the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.160]   against all the godlessness and wickedness of people
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.240]   who suppress the truth by their wickedness
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.200]   since what may be known about God is plain to them
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.320]   because God has made it plain to them.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.520]   And the next two and a half chapters
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   are essentially the justification of that conclusion.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.960]   The wrath of God is in the process of being revealed
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.440]   in God's abandonment of people.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.160]   He gives them over to the sinful desires of their own hearts.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   And the concluding list of Old Testament quotations
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.200]   is startling in its vision of human conduct.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.280]   Chapter three, verses 10 and following,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.360]   as it is written, there is no one righteous, not even one.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.760]   There is no one who understands.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.100]   There is no one who seeks God.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.940]   All have turned away.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.440]   They have together become worthless.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.280]   There is no one who does good, not even one, and so forth.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.320]   All of this is part of the description,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.640]   the unpacking of what it means in 118 to say
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.840]   the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.920]   against all the godlessness and wickedness of people.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.300]   In other words, salvation necessarily demands
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.280]   that God's wrath somehow be set aside.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.560]   Salvation consists in part, it's not the whole part,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.680]   but it consists in part in being saved
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.560]   from the righteous wrath of God.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.480]   And that is where propitiation lies.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.680]   So now we're into an array of terms
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.340]   connected with the atonement.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.320]   We see again and again how different biblical themes
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.560]   bring us back to the cross.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.440]   In this case, the wrath of God brings us to the cross
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.540]   in that it is one of the ways the Bible speaks
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.960]   of God's formidable holiness arrayed
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.900]   against our sinfulness and rebellion.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.900]   And somehow that righteous wrath must be turned aside
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.020]   or we are utterly undone, we are lost, we face judgment.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.980]   That's why the cross is understood in the New Testament
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.980]   not only to cancel sin, but to propitiate God.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.020]   God becomes both the author
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.700]   and the object of propitiation.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.700]   He plans things such that Christ bears our sin and guilt
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.200]   and cancels it, but at the same time,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.080]   by canceling our sin, satisfies God's sense of justice
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.680]   and his wrath is turned aside,
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.520]   he becomes propitious toward us, favorable toward us
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.320]   by the plan and decree and purposes of God in redemption.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.040]   And within this framework,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.320]   this pattern of understanding what salvation is about
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.480]   recurs again and again and again,
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.460]   sometimes using the wrath word and sometimes not.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.360]   For example, Ephesians 1 says that we are all by nature
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.880]   children of wrath, we are all under the condemnation of God
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.240]   apart from God's gracious salvation brought to us.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.240]   And the ultimate descriptions of hell are likewise
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.040]   a reflection of God's judicial determination to punish sin.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.920]   And thus we read, for example, regarding the devil.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.040]   The devil who deceived them was thrown
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.640]   into the lake of burning sulfur
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.440]   where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.240]   They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   Revelation 20.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.600]   All of this is a function of God's wrath
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.000]   even though the word wrath isn't really used there.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.760]   Now, it's worth pausing for a moment to think
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.200]   about some of the ways in which wrath relates
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.600]   to other attributes of God.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   God's love and God's wrath are not symmetrical.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.860]   The Bible does say that God is love.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.360]   It never says that God is wrath.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.640]   The closest it gets to it is saying
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.840]   that God is a consuming fire,
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.640]   which fire burns both to purify us and to punish.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.440]   But that consuming fire is itself a function
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.660]   of his holiness.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.040]   What is really important when you think about both love
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.920]   and wrath in the nature of God is that the doctrine
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   of impassibility so-called needs to be rightly understood.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.680]   The majority of Christians across the whole history
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.100]   of the church have affirmed the impassibility of God.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.140]   But sometimes that doctrine has been misunderstood.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.120]   God becomes impassible, that is,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.480]   not subject to emotions, born along by his reason,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.760]   his knowledge, his sovereignty, but not by his emotions.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.680]   And thus there's a danger of thinking God
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.960]   in almost a Stoic sense.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.120]   But that just won't do.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.920]   It won't do for either his love or his wrath.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.040]   He's the God who yearns for his people,
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.440]   who loves them, who cries, "Turn, turn, why will you die?
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.400]   "The Lord has no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.640]   "God so loved the world that he gave his son."
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.100]   There are so many, many, many verses
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.320]   that emphasize the love of God,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   and not a few that emphasize his wrath
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.000]   as a function of his holiness.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.840]   Sometimes the judgment that is poured out on his people
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.280]   in the Old Testament is said to continue
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.520]   until his wrath is turned aside,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.500]   until his judgment is satisfied.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.900]   But what we must see, it seems to me, in both cases,
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.840]   is that God doesn't, to use a contemporary expression,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.400]   fall in love.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.440]   And he's not wrathful because he loses it.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.880]   He blows up just because his patience runs out
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.880]   in some purely emotional way.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.960]   If God is acting in love,
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.480]   it's in the context of all of his perfections.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.420]   He acts in holiness and love and in truth,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.120]   not because he sets holiness over against love
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.980]   and it's a sort of zero-sum game.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.300]   A little more love today means a little less holiness.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.660]   A little more holiness tomorrow means a little less love.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.860]   It's not a zero-sum game.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.900]   God always acts in conjunction with all of his attributes.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.260]   And thus, although he does love us,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.920]   never does he fall in love with us
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   because that suggests he is caught up in a web of emotion
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.420]   that controls him apart from what he might think
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.580]   or his judgment or his sovereignty or his justice.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.360]   He can't help himself.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.060]   In that sense, he is impassable.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.660]   It's not as if he's controlled by his emotions,
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.560]   but it's not as if he's emotionless either.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.540]   In that sense, impassability can be misunderstood.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.040]   And similarly with wrath,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.020]   God doesn't sort of lose his temper.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.700]   It's a judicial function of his holiness
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.820]   against the backdrop of our sinfulness.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.340]   If there were no sin in the universe,
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.820]   there would never ever be any expression of God's wrath.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.420]   In that sense, God's wrath is, unlike his love, contingent.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.800]   God is love regardless of what else there is in the universe,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.340]   including our sin.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.900]   But God's wrath is contingent
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.740]   upon either the sin of the fallen angels or our sin.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.700]   What's not contingent is God's holiness.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.740]   God's holiness, God's sovereignty,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.460]   God's love and the other attributes
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.280]   that are part of his eternal being are always in play.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   And God's wrath is a function of those attributes
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.860]   when faced with our sin.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.620]   One more clarification that's probably worth making.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.840]   There are some people who say
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.060]   that once a person becomes a Christian,
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.540]   there should never be any further talk
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.380]   of God's wrath in that person's life.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.620]   There should never be any fear.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.380]   Perfect love casts out fear.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.500]   And thus, Christians who've enjoyed
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.260]   God's perfect love in Christ Jesus
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.140]   need never to fear again.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.960]   That's not quite right.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.300]   I know what is being said.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.020]   The true element in that kind of utterance
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.320]   is that those who are amongst the chosen of God,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.020]   the elect of God, don't face the fear of final judgment.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.020]   They don't face the fear of God's eternal wrath in hell.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.380]   Yet, Paul writing to the Philippians
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.020]   says that we're to work out our salvation
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.580]   with fear and trembling.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.000]   God's love is perfect,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.620]   but we don't experience it perfectly
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.580]   because we still continue to sin.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.740]   And there is a kind of punishment
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.020]   that God enacts in the same way
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.540]   that an earthly father punishes his children rightly
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.880]   for their good.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.800]   It's not an act of ultimate judicial judgment.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.860]   Of course not.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.740]   Not if you are amongst the people of God.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.980]   But nevertheless, if Paul can insist
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.380]   that the way we work out our salvation
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.940]   is with fear and trembling,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.740]   it's precisely because we are not yet ourselves
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.480]   perfected in love and won't be perfected in love
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.660]   until the new heaven and the new earth.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.460]   So that's a sort of a brief bird's eye view
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.120]   of the theme and the way it's connected
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.480]   with several other themes right across
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.520]   the whole breadth and sweep of scripture.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.140]   - Such an essential theme to grasp.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.180]   Thank you for that survey.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.260]   Dr. Carson, so we're helping Bible readers
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.340]   put their Bibles together,
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.900]   Genesis to Revelation thematically.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.340]   And as you mentioned earlier,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.620]   we see 600 references to God's wrath
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.940]   in the Old Testament, 600.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.480]   What would you say to a reader who thinks
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.760]   the God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath,
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.620]   but the God of the New Testament is a God of love?
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.780]   How do you reconcile the false dichotomy
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.860]   that feels so very real to many Bible readers?
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.100]   - Well, it's a good question.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.060]   The objection that you raise
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.860]   is an exceedingly common one.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.940]   And I think it's partly because contemporary readers
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.940]   look at the passages of judgment in the Old Testament
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.580]   and they're bound up with war and famine
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.840]   and physical suffering and so on.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.340]   And today people are more frightened
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.260]   of those kinds of things than they are of hell itself.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.300]   But the reality is that the Old Testament
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.160]   speaks much of the love of God
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.740]   as a father pities his children.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.460]   So the Lord pities us.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.440]   He knows our frame.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.980]   He remembers that we are dust.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.740]   He will not always chide.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.300]   He is slow to anger, abounding in love and mercy.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.580]   All of those are Old Testament phrases,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.340]   Old Testament themes.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.620]   And in the New Testament, yes, yes,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.780]   we speak of gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.540]   who will not snuff a smoking wick
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.100]   or break a bruised wreath and so on.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.060]   But that same Jesus is the one who speaks more often
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.700]   than everybody else in the New Testament put together
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.640]   about hell.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.620]   And then there are passages like the end of Romans,
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.260]   of Revelation 14,
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.500]   the angel swung a sickle on the earth,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500]   gathered its grapes and threw them
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.340]   into the great winepress of God's wrath.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.860]   They were trampled in the winepress outside the city
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.980]   and blood flowed out of the press,
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.880]   rising as high as the horses' bridles
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.460]   for a distance of 1600 stadia.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.140]   Here is an image, metaphorical though it may be,
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.180]   of people being trampled down in a winepress
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.260]   until their blood rises to the height of a horse's bridle
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260]   for a distance of 200 miles.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.700]   And within that framework,
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.580]   to speak of the New Testament being kinder and gentler
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.820]   is hugely mistaken.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.960]   Instead of moving from a picture of the wrath of God
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.460]   to a picture of the love of God
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.020]   as you move from the Old Testament to the New,
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.700]   I think instead what you have
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.180]   is the ratcheting up of both themes.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.620]   That is, as you move from the Old to the New,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.140]   the picture of the love of God is ratcheted up.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.680]   It does become ever clearer and more wonderful
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.860]   and more explicit,
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.020]   bound up with the very person and work of Christ.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.540]   But the picture of hell is also ratcheted up,
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.740]   so that far from softening things
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.940]   as you move from temporal judgments and earthly judgments
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.780]   and war and famine and plague,
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.020]   you don't move from there to softness
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.380]   and moral indifferentism.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.380]   You move instead to hell itself.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.660]   It seems to me that both of those themes are ratcheted up,
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.940]   and the only way they can ever be reconciled
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.460]   is precisely in the cross.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.820]   - That is a magnificently helpful statement
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.020]   for Bible readers to understand, so key.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.580]   So wrath is ratcheted up as redemptive history unfolds.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.960]   This becomes a heavier and heavier theme,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.940]   but it also invites us to a new appreciation
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.740]   for the cross, I think.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.980]   If the church loses its grip on God's wrath for sin,
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.780]   salvation can really degenerate pretty quickly
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.580]   and even be reduced to terms
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.780]   primarily about sort of therapeutic well-being
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.540]   or self-actualizing.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.640]   Talk to us about the implications here.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.140]   - That's a common trajectory.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.340]   It doesn't have to go that far,
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.460]   but it's a common trajectory.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.300]   In other words, there are some people
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.340]   who talk about the canceling of sin
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.460]   and the canceling of guilt and the canceling of shame,
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.300]   and in that sense are remaining true
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.940]   to one of the important themes in Scripture.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.020]   But if you lose the turning aside of the wrath of God,
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.920]   what you lose is how sin is itself
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.140]   bound up with offending God.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.340]   It's not just offending an impersonal moral code,
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.820]   it's offending God.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.820]   And thus, the love of God is lost,
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.020]   or at least the glory of the love of God is lost.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.980]   What you have is a nice God who comes and loves us
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.780]   in some measure to get us out of the trouble
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.620]   that we've found ourselves in, that we've put ourselves in,
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.700]   but you don't have a picture of a God
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.140]   who rightly stands against us in judicial wrath
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.880]   and loves us anyway because he's that kind of God.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.280]   And that's the biggest thing that's lost, it seems to me.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.260]   And then with time, a softening view of sin
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.740]   means a softening view of wrath and vice versa.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.860]   If you have a softening view of wrath,
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.300]   then sin becomes less an offense to God
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.980]   than a kind of moral failure against
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.860]   an independent impersonal code.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.220]   And thus, it becomes less personally offensive to God
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.940]   and the notion of salvation is changed.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.620]   And then it's possible to take further steps
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.200]   along the trajectory until salvation itself
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.300]   becomes more psychological than anything.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.260]   It's not an inevitable pathway, but it's a very common one.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.380]   - So good and rich, thank you, Dr. Carson.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.980]   - Yeah, blessings on you.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.660]   - That was a world-class biblical theology
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.660]   made to look so easy.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.860]   And that was Dr. Don Carson from his home office
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.540]   joining us again by way of our partnership
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.600]   with our friends over at the Gospel Coalition.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.980]   Carson is co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.460]   We are now breaking for the weekend.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.500]   And this weekend, feel free to look back on the episodes
