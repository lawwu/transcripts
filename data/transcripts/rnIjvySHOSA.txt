[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   This is one that I'm a firm believer in.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.440]   The idea here of the five-year rule is that you should only put money into the stock market
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.960]   that you won't need to spend, that you know you won't need to spend for at least five
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.960]   years.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.320]   The reason dovetails with what exactly I said previously.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.600]   The stock market is unpredictable, especially in the short term, and I define the short
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200]   term as anything less than three years.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.040]   However, if you can keep your money in the S&P 500 for a period of five years, the odds
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.180]   of you earning a positive real return, real meaning after the effects of inflation, are
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.800]   actually very high.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.200]   The number is about 80%.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.240]   So you have an 80% chance, if you can keep your money in the stock market for five years
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.520]   or longer, of earning a positive real return.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.600]   That to me is an acceptable level of risk to take on, although everybody is different.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920]   But if you're going to go for a shorter time period than that, the math is just not nearly
