[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   David writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John, I'm a 22-year-old single Christian in Singapore.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.500]   How does a Christian single see and savor Christ as his all and ultimate satisfaction, yet have desires to be married?
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.000]   How do I reconcile my desires for marriage with my satisfaction in Christ?"
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Right. The first thing I want to say to David is that the desire to be married, a good desire,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   is one of hundreds of desires that might compete with satisfaction in Christ.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Desire to have a job, you don't have one. Desire to be free from cancer when you're sick.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Desire no longer to be blind or disabled if you're disabled. Desire to have enough money to go to college when you don't.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Desire to be tall instead of short. In other words, the desire for marriage is not unique.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It's not a unique challenge. I just don't want David to feel isolated, like he's got a battle to fight that I don't have.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   We all have desires that put us in the same battle for how does contentment or satisfaction in Christ relate to the intensity of those desires from time to time.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And the second thing I'd say is that we should probably remind ourselves that there are good desires and bad desires.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   The desire to be married is a good desire. The desire for adultery is a bad desire.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   The desire for food is a good desire. Gluttony is a bad desire.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So David is not dealing with the conflict between evil desire and good contentment in Jesus.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   He knows that, but I'm just making it clear for all the rest of us.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   The question is how does contentment, satisfaction in Jesus relate to good desires that tug at us and make us feel some measure of discontent?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Are we contradicting our desire for and our delight in Jesus?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It might be good to put a text on this issue of contentment or satisfaction because he's just kind of assuming it and maybe not everybody even thinks in those categories.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So here's Philippians 3.8, "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So Paul seems to have such a sweet experience of knowing Jesus.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Everything else pales by comparison. It's just loss. He's so happy in his fellowship with Jesus.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Or another one would be at the end of Philippians in chapter 4, he says, "I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content or satisfied.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I know how to be brought low. I know how to abound in every and in any circumstance.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I can do all things. I can be satisfied in all circumstances through him who strengthens me."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So clearly, Jesus gave Paul an amazing contentment.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Those are amazing verses. We all just long to be like that. I do.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   But here's something crucial.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Paul's contentment in Jesus in every circumstance did not make him passive, as though there was nothing in the world to change or nothing to pursue.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Remember his incredible passion to preach the gospel to every place and person that didn't have Christ named.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   "I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He said, "I no longer have any room for work in these regions.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain and get help on my journey."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So here's a man that seems driven. I mean, he wants to go to Spain.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Why wouldn't we say, "Paul, you don't sound very, you know, content in Jesus."
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Why wouldn't we say that?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Jesus doesn't make him passive in his satisfaction in Jesus.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   He doesn't say, "I have Jesus. I don't need to go to Spain.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I don't need to risk my life to get the gospel to other people because I have Jesus.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I have sweet fellowship. I'll sit under a tree, cross my legs like a Buddha and let the world go to hell in a handbasket, and I will be satisfied in Jesus."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It simply doesn'tâ€”satisfaction in Jesus doesn't work that way.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Contentment in Jesus is not paralyzing. It's energizing.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   A person who is so content in Jesus, they have no desires to change anything in the world or to extend that contentment to others.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   They're not content in Jesus. Not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   The contentment Jesus gives is meant in this fallen world and probably for eternity to grow and grow and grow,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   to increase by expressing it in risk-taking acts of love and by drawing others into it.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's the sort of contentment that gets bigger when it expands to include other people.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So, now back to marriage. What about marriage?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So that's all kind of foundation.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Here's my question. Do you want this for the sake of savoring and showing more of Christ?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Will your enjoyment of a wife be an enlargement of your enjoyment of Christ?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Will your enjoyment of Christ be enlarged by drawing a wife into it?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Will her enjoyment of Christ be enlarged by drawing you into hers?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Those are some of the ways that I would try to relate our contentment in Christ to, as a single person, to marriage.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   In reality, and this is where the rubber meets the road, I suppose, for him.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   In reality, the day-to-day experience will be a battle to rest in Christ and act for joy.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Rest in Christ and act for joy.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   They feel intention often. There's no quantification for this.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I don't know how to give a quantity, like how much do you rest and how much do you quest, you know?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   You discover it in actual walking with Christ and telling him all you feel, asking him for all his help, all his wisdom,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   about when to rest and when to act, and how to be restful in him even while acting.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And so I think the last thing I could say is God's going to show you.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   If you embrace that kind of understanding of contentment in Jesus, he'll show you how to weigh out the longings you have for marriage
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   and how appropriate they are in expressing your longings for Christ.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And if you are not yet married, we have a couple of other episodes in the Ask Pastor John archive for you,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   including episode number 170, "How Singleness is Good," and episode number 262,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "If My Church Lacks Available Singles, Should I Leave It?"
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Also check out the very popular blog post written by our very own Marshall Siegel at our blog and website DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Tomorrow we will look at a very frequent question we get in the Ask Pastor John email inbox,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   "Do our loved ones in heaven look down on us?"
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   We'll hear Pastor John's thoughts on that tomorrow.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
