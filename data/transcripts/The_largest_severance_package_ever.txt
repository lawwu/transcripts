[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this short episode I want to talk about
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.280]   the largest severance package ever.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.740]   It blows any severance package I have ever seen out of the water and I think it should
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.120]   help you believe, if you don't believe you can negotiate a severance package, that you
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.120]   can.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.440]   So over the years, I've received some doubt from three types of people regarding the feasibility
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.740]   of negotiating a severance package.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.920]   The first set of people I'll call the holier than thou people.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.220]   They tell me that "they'd never do such a thing" to their employer as if their employer
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.460]   was a sacred cow.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.140]   But what they don't seem to realize, probably due to having never experienced a recession,
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.760]   is that corporations won't hesitate to lay them off as soon as times get tough.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960]   It's globalization folks, competition is higher than ever.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.740]   The second set of non-believers are those who don't know their worth.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.000]   They're the type that let colleagues and bosses step all over them because they're too afraid
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   to speak up.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And I gotta tell you folks, bosses hope that employees don't speak up for a raise in promotion
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.440]   they deserve, so they can save the company money and get paid more.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.080]   These type of non-believers also fear they do not provide enough value to warrant a severance.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.880]   And it could be true, they are bad employees, but if you have a job, know that you only
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.000]   have a job because you provide more value than your compensation.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.200]   Otherwise you would be fired already.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.280]   Finally, the final set of non-believers are those who think they are God's gift to their
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   employers.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.680]   They think they provide so much value, they can't fathom an employer paying them to leave.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.940]   But what they fail to realize is that it is precisely because they offer value that they
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.280]   have leverage to negotiate a severance to ensure continuity in the job.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.680]   The last thing an employer wants is a value-added employee suddenly saying "see you later,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.600]   I'm out of here in one or two weeks" while not finding a replacement.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.960]   So this is something really important to know.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.360]   Further, once you indicate you want to work something out, no employer will want you to
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:14.600]   stay long term no matter how valuable you are.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.840]   So despite all the doubters, I believe with all my heart that trying to negotiate a severance
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.020]   package is the financially savviest move if you plan to retire early, take a break, go
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.200]   back to school, or change careers, or maybe even be a stay-at-home dad like I've been
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.320]   for the past 30 months.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.960]   If you plan to leave anyway and if you negotiate the situation properly, there is no downside
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.000]   to having a conversation.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.600]   And this is what really gets me is that so many people fear having a conversation, fear
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.360]   having confrontation as if it's something taboo.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.840]   It's not scary if you approach the conversation and the severance negotiation properly.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.200]   And that's why I wrote my book which is now on its third edition.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.640]   And since I first published the book in 2012, I've heard back from hundreds of readers who've
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.440]   successfully negotiated between $10,000 to $700,000 severance packages.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.120]   But in this episode, I want to highlight the one that takes it all, takes the cake, the
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.320]   largest severance package ever in the history of America and the world is the one given
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.560]   to Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork, who was able to negotiate a $1.7 billion severance
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.440]   package from SoftBank, operator of the Vision Fund, which is an owner and investor in WeWork,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.560]   and it's the largest venture capital fund in the world at about $100 billion.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.760]   Adam will get the ability to sell about $1 billion in stock back to SoftBank.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.480]   He'll also receive a $500 million loan to repay a credit line.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.640]   Further, he will get an estimated $185 million consulting fee.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.360]   In exchange for the severance package, Adam will get to say bye bye to the board, but
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.400]   I think they still have some voting right power.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.720]   I'm not so sure, the story's developing.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   Okay, so let's say the severance package is only the $185 million consulting fee since
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   Adam's stock had already vested and the $500 million was a loan that he has to eventually
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   pay back.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.160]   $185 million is still the largest severance package ever for torpedoing your company.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.640]   And although the dollar amount truly is staggering, what is even more amazing is the fact that
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.240]   he got a severance package at all.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.960]   Part of a severance package clause is that you actually do no wrong, there's no fault
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   in what you've done, you didn't harass an employee, you didn't kick someone in the face,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.120]   you didn't steal company secrets, and so forth.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.840]   When I was working in investment banking, our bonuses had a clawback provision where
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.520]   if an individual, department, or the firm was found to have done something wrong, the
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.080]   firm could "claw back" the employee bonuses for the past three years.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   Our bonuses were already structured in a way that kept us handcuffed for years.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.760]   For example, the most our bonus could be paid at immediate cash was between 10-30%.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.360]   So if you got a $100,000 bonus, only $10,000-$30,000 was in cash.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.720]   Still sounds like a good number, but again, you got a $100,000 bonus.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.960]   The remainder of the bonus was paid out in cash, deferred cash and stock, over a three-year
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.200]   time period.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.140]   So let's say the deferment was $90,000 out of the $100,000.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.960]   You would get $30,000 in a year's time, another $30,000 after two years, and then the final
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.160]   $30,000 after three years.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.000]   Therefore, if you quit before the three-year time period was over, you forfeited a portion
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.920]   of your bonus in a prorated amount.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.560]   The only way you could be made whole was to negotiate a severance and capture all that
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.880]   deferred compensation as part of the package.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.640]   So if you do something wrong, you're going to get a clawback.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.320]   So although Adam and his management team were able to get private investors like SoftBank
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.960]   to invest in them at a $47 billion valuation before 2019, public investors balked at that
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.880]   valuation once the S-1 was filed for public review.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.980]   The S-1 is just an official document where public investors get to review the information
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.000]   about the company before making an informed investment.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.800]   Investors after reading the S-1 realized there were a lot of corporate governance issues
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.100]   going on between Adam and the company.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:29.280]   For example, ahead of its IPO filing, WeWork reorganized and rebranded as the "We Company."
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.720]   To rebrand itself around the word "we," the company paid Adam $5.9 million for trademark
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.840]   rights that he owned.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:47.960]   He went to buy that trademark with the plan to re-brand and then pay himself $5.9 million
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:58.720]   through the company.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.000]   WeWork also disclosed details on some interesting rental arrangements with Adam.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.400]   The company said Adam owned four properties that had WeWork as a tenant.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.960]   For one building, the company entered a lease within a year of Newman acquiring his ownership
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   stake.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.640]   For the other three, it signed a lease on the same day the co-founder obtained his stakes.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.200]   How did Adam get the money to buy buildings to lease back to WeWork?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.920]   Probably from his WeWork stock that he sold and from the income he earned.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.720]   This kind of double-dipping arrangement is really smart and probably goes on a lot in
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.960]   private companies where there's no corporate governance and you can do whatever you want.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.040]   But again, as a public company, shareholders are going to balk at this double-dipping.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.720]   The final corporate governance issue is Adam hiring a lot of friends and family off the
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.280]   WeWork payroll to do work.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.880]   That's fine if you have a private company.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.160]   In fact, that's one of the biggest benefits of owning a private company and staying private,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.680]   being able to hire whoever you choose to take care of them.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:10.120]   As a dad now, my hope is that my son and my kids will be their own people and be independent
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.600]   after they graduate high school.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.160]   Now there's a chance that they might not be and maybe old man is going to have to hire
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.280]   them back to do some work.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.280]   Who knows?
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   But it's nice to have that insurance mechanism, that flexibility if you own your private company
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.880]   and that's something everybody should think about on why they should start their own company.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.480]   But again, if you're going to go public with public shareholders and people to account
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.640]   for, it's probably not going to be looked upon favorably.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.000]   But the biggest reason for the decline in WeWork's valuation is the sustainability
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.800]   of its business model.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.480]   WeWork takes out long-term leases.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.040]   They estimated to have $43 billion worth of long-term leases and an average duration of
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.760]   15 years.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.000]   And then they collect short-term rents after remodeling a space.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.360]   So you get in there and you say you want to rent a room or a conference room for $700
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.520]   a month, done and you don't have any long-term obligation at all.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.000]   And this is where investors kind of fear the business model is not going to work because
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.760]   in a recession, are you really going to spend money to go to a WeWork and pay $700 a month?
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   Probably not.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   You're probably just going to work from home or you're going to work at a free coffee shop.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.640]   So WeWork lost $1.6 billion on $1.8 billion in revenue in 2018.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.160]   And it's really hard to see profitability improving without massive restructuring and
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.360]   downsizing.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   It clearly needed the money it was going to raise from its IPO.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.920]   So if it didn't have a savior, it was probably, I would say the years were numbered without
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.780]   any capital infusion.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.880]   So that's where SoftBank comes in.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.920]   In a face-saving move, SoftBank decided to bail out WeWork with $5 billion in further
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.440]   funding after already investing like $10 billion, something.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.040]   And then they already have $1.5 billion of which had already been pledged for the future.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.980]   Plus they had an additional $3 billion tender offer for existing shareholders outside SoftBank.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:14.080]   So that is the move where Adam was able to take advantage and get his $1.7 billion severance
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   package because now SoftBank owns about 80% of the company, it seems.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.520]   The media is making WeWork's collapse to be all Adam's fault, and I think that's
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   totally unfair to him given there's a board of directors and other top management and
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.380]   founders involved in making company level decisions.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.480]   But let's say the $32 billion valuation collapse was 10% due to Adam's fault.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.920]   That's still a $3.2 billion hit.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.720]   And in every single severance negotiation I've ever been a part of or have witnessed,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.080]   if you materially hurt the company, you'll not only not get a severance, you'll get
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:56.120]   fired and be forced to forfeit all stock and deferred compensation.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.400]   You may also be fined or sued depending on what you do for causing harm.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.880]   And the sad thing is, look, the valuation is a huge collapse, 70-80%.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.960]   The 12,000 employees who are all hoping to get rich and liquid are not getting rich and
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   liquid.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.640]   It's also estimated that 1/3 of the global employee count is going to get fired, and
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.280]   that probably has to happen given the valuation collapse.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.680]   It's unclear whether these employees will get severance packages, but if they do, you
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   can bet they won't be very good.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.160]   And that $3 billion tender from SoftBank is probably at valuation 70% lower than $47 billion.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.960]   So really, some employees are going to get something, but it's probably not very good
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.160]   at all for the large majority of them.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   And so, due to all this carnage, I think Adam shouldn't get a severance package, let alone
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.440]   one that's valued at over a billion dollars.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:00.640]   Because you forget, he already cashed out on $700 million in stock in late 2017.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.000]   So let's review six things, six lessons we should all learn from this amazing, amazing
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   situation.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   1.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.640]   To get rich, you must own equity.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.280]   About $1 billion of Adam's severance package comes from SoftBank buying out Adam's stock
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.200]   at roughly a $9-10 billion valuation.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.160]   It's very hard to get rich off salary alone because salaries get turned off once you lose
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   your job.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.480]   Further, salaries are also valued at a 1 to 1 ratio, whereas equity is valued at a multiple
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.840]   of earnings.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.760]   You want to earn both on your road to financial freedom.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   2.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.800]   To get rich, you must learn how to sell.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.840]   Adam was able to sell his vision extremely well to very smart investors such as SoftBank.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   3.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   Benchmark.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.800]   Benchmark is a big name that has had huge home runs in the past.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.040]   JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, T. Rowe Price, Wellington, Harvard Corp, and the former CEO of Boston
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.440]   Properties.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.040]   He was able to convince them that we work as a technology company that deserved a higher
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.480]   valuation multiple, despite it really only being a poorly capitalized REIT.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.600]   3.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.720]   To get rich, you've always got to go fishing.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.640]   What are you fishing for?
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.040]   You're fishing for fish.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.640]   You're fishing for suckers out there.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.440]   There's a fun saying that goes at the poker table, "If you don't know who the sucker
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.900]   is in the room, it's you."
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.720]   So try not to be the sucker.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.800]   There's always a sucker out there though that you can take advantage of because they either
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.960]   have these empire-building ego tendencies, or they have too much money, or they found
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.000]   other suckers to invest in their fund, or simply they just don't understand what's
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   going on.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It's sad.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.120]   It's sad to take advantage of some suckers if they're just not well-off suckers, but
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.320]   if they're very, very wealthy suckers, I don't know.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.360]   It's like, "Here, let's distribute the wealth here."
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.440]   Although it seems like SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund is the sucker, it's kind of not
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.960]   really the sucker because it was able to convince Saudi Arabia's Foreign Wealth Fund to invest
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.000]   $45 billion into the fund and Abu Dhabi's National Wealth Fund to invest $15 billion
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.520]   into the fund.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:15.960]   So 60% of the fund is made up of two sovereign wealth funds and SoftBank's founders and
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:22.600]   employees get to earn carried interest and management fees off those billions.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.880]   So it's always awesome to get rich off other people's money without having the corresponding
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   downside risk.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.960]   Because look, if SoftBank loses $50 billion, it's like, "Well, it's not their money.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   It's the client's money."
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.680]   And as a startup, you hope SoftBank launches its Vision Fund 2 as it's touting so you can
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.080]   raise even more money or cash out to SoftBank Vision Fund 2.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.720]   And look, only time will tell if SoftBank's takeover of WeWork turns out to be an incredible
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   move or not.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.560]   I mean, right now it looks like a face-saving move, but in the future, you can say, "Hey,
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   you know what?
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.920]   The time to buy is when there's blood on the streets."
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.160]   And clearly there's blood on the streets with WeWork and the time to buy was back in 2009
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.680]   and 2010, right?
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.200]   So maybe SoftBank will turn out to be a great move.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.280]   All right, the fourth lesson, you should always diversify your wins.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.080]   You can never lose if you lock in a win.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.120]   I know we all think we're brilliant geniuses in this 10-plus year bull market, but bad
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.360]   things still do happen.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.400]   First look at WeWork, look at Uber, look at Lyft.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.640]   Adam brilliantly sold $700 million of stock before IPO at a huge, huge valuation, despite
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.320]   trying to convince the public and its employees to buy part of his company and work for him.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.040]   I mean, it's not good optics to sell out that big of a chunk of your holdings before
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.720]   IPO.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.100]   Even if he didn't get the $1.7 billion in sovereignty package, he would be set for life.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.220]   So when things are going splendidly well, that is when you should have your spidey senses
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.400]   turned on to the max.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.480]   Five, you probably shouldn't work for a startup.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.880]   Look, the media loves to talk about big winners and big hits.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.920]   It's sexy.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.240]   But if 90% of startups fail, then by definition, 90% of employees will not get richer than
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.320]   if they had worked at a traditional firm for a higher salary.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.220]   Startup employees make less salary, make less cash compensation for the hopes of the lottery
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.220]   ticket winnings.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.140]   But that lottery ticket generally doesn't pan out.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.300]   Just look at Uber and Lyft again.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:29.180]   Anybody who joined after about 2015 is probably just treading water or below water, frankly,
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.540]   because they took a lower salary.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.780]   So I would say work at a startup if you don't need the money or you really, really believe
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.740]   in the mission or you just want to gain a lot of experience quickly so that you can
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.620]   start your own startup one day.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.300]   That's what a lot of startup funders do.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.540]   But don't trick yourself into believing that you are going to win the lottery because most
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.540]   people don't win the lottery.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.500]   Finally, obviously negotiate a severance package.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.620]   For goodness sake, if Adam can negotiate a 1.7 billion severance package despite helping
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.540]   torpedo his company into the ground, you too should be able to negotiate a severance if
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.180]   you work with your employer to provide a smooth transition.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.940]   Find out what the employer wants.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.460]   Find out how you can provide value to allow for that transition to be smooth and for there
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.980]   to be minimal, minimal disruption.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.780]   If you do, you will get that severance package or you'll get something better than nothing,
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.500]   which is what most people get when they quit.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.620]   There is so much money out there for the taking, folks.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:36.740]   It's up to you to develop awareness and your selling and negotiation skills.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.220]   Awareness comes with knowledge.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:44.980]   So please read up as much as you can, understand various scenarios and case studies and go
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.020]   get that money.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.060]   Go get that money that you deserve.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.340]   You are or were a valuable employee, otherwise you wouldn't have had the job.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.580]   You would have been fired a long time ago and that is why you have leverage to be able
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.420]   to negotiate a severance.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.220]   Once you realize how much money is out there for the taking, you'll come to realize how
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.300]   much money is always being left on the table every single day by people who don't know
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   better.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.220]   I hope this was an eye-opening episode because it was an eye-opening episode for me.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.620]   The bar has been raised for severance negotiations to an amazing, amazing amount.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:23.820]   If you want to read the book, go check it out from my homepage and use the code "SAVE10"
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.820]   to save $10.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.820]   Thanks so much, everyone.
