[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   what is a good example of a, you know, a pre-training meal, if you will? What is the
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.560]   timing of that meal relative to training that works best? Yeah. I mean, like I'm the kind of
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.320]   person gets up and is out the door within a half an hour to go do whatever I'm going to do. So it's
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.600]   not like I'm going to have a full meal. I've heard of people like you. Yeah. Meaning I tend
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.540]   to move slowly in the morning. I wish I could, but the way my life is, it doesn't work that way.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.160]   So, but I'm also one of the people that never really has an appetite till 11 o'clock.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.340]   Okay. So we're similar in that way. Yeah. So how do you, how do you square that?
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.020]   So I make a double espresso at night and I put some almond milk and a scoop of protein powder in there.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.340]   So the almond milk is sweetened and usually it's unsweetened, but sweetened for the carb
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.300]   and then the protein powder for the protein. Because if I'm going to go do an ocean swim,
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.880]   then I need some carbohydrate and protein on board. If I'm going to just go to the gym,
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.340]   then I'll probably just have the protein powder in the coffee. Yes, I'm caffeinating,
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.880]   but I'm also getting the calories for the hypothalamus and getting some more circulating
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.220]   amino acids. Abby Smith-Ryan out of UNC did some specific work looking at carbohydrate,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.160]   protein before and strength or cardio and found that if you're going to do a true strength training
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.000]   session, you only need around 15 grams of protein before you go to really help you get into the idea
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.660]   that yes, you have some fuel on board and also increases your post-exercise oxygen consumption
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.520]   or your EPOC. So your resting metabolism stays elevated, giving you a better chance for recovery
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.640]   post-exercise as well. If you're going to do any kind of cardiovascular type work up to an hour,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.240]   then you're adding 30 grams of carb to that. So it's not a lot of food and it's not a full meal.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.660]   Other people are like, I'm starving right before I go training. Then yes, you can have your meal,
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.760]   giving yourself about a half an hour before. But it doesn't have to be major food that we're talking
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.460]   about. But that's just enough to bring blood sugar up and stimulate the hypothalamus to say,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.120]   yeah, there's some nutrition coming in. And then you have your real food afterwards. You have your
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.300]   breakfast afterwards within 45 minutes. As a neuroscientist, I find it so interesting that
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.120]   at least some of what you're talking about with this pre-workout meal, and perhaps most of it
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.160]   relates to how ingesting those calories impacts the brain, protects those kispeptin neurons.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.700]   And we'll talk more about kispeptin, very interesting peptide.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.960]   As opposed to saying, okay, you need X number of calories because you're going to burn X number
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.380]   of calories. I hate that conversation.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.160]   Right. Which is a very different conversation. Here, what we're talking about is the neural
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   aspects of being able to generate intensity, also blunt cortisol, and get the most out of training
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.660]   without putting the body into kind of an emergency state.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.960]   Yeah. And the longer someone withholds food after exercise, and the greater they stay in that
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.900]   catabolic or breakdown state, the more the brain perceives it as being in a low energy state.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.240]   So the first thing to go is lean mass. When you start telling a woman that, you know,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.000]   if you're going to do fasted training and or you're going to delay food intake afterwards,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.400]   why are you training? Because the first thing that goes is lean mass. And it's really,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.200]   really hard for women to put on lean mass. So once you start really nailing that and then saying,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.680]   look, you just need 15 grams of protein to really help and be able to conserve that lean mass. It's
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.040]   a small, simple fix. People try it and they're like, oh my gosh, I feel amazing. So small little
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.220]   things when you're working with the whole system, because I get tired, especially around Christmas
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.300]   time when you're reading all the magazines, it's like two cookies means you have to walk for 30 minutes
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.940]   on the treadmill. It's like, it doesn't, it doesn't correlate like that at all. So that's why I was
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.920]   like, I hate the calorie conversation because it's just not applicable.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.880]   Right. And it has its own kind of, um, elements of being laced with neuroticism about calorie counting.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.380]   And then that can drift easily into the realm of eating disorders. I did an episode about eating
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.980]   disorders some years ago. And as I was researching that episode, um, I learned that people with eating
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.080]   disorders, women and men, um, especially anorexia become like calorie calculators, their eyes and
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.460]   their brain just are constantly evaluating the caloric load of food. And it can be, um, obviously
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.380]   very intrusive. It's also the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions. So it's, um, that's a long
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.640]   way from hopefully what we're talking about here, but, but there's the opportunity for drift whenever
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.020]   talking about calorie counting in and out. We of course believe in the laws of thermodynamics and
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.100]   calories in calories out, but I love what you're describing here as getting the brain in a mode that
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.660]   the brain and body are protected so that one can invest in that high intensity exercise and get the
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.860]   adaptations that one wants, but not send everything down this pathway of, um, you know, just becoming a
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.340]   computer of, you know, how much am I exercising? What did I burn? What did I earn? It's, it's, it's,
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.000]   it's crazy. It's crazy. Um, as long as we're talking about food and food intake relative to training,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.300]   what is the suggested post-training, um, window, um, in which one should either avoid or make sure they
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.540]   get nutrition? Um, meaning how long does one have after, let's say a resistance training session of
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.420]   about an hour? It seems to me that's what most people are doing. If they're investing in resistance
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:40.180]   training, maybe a plus or minus, uh, what, 20 minutes. Um, and they're hitting those, um, high
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.280]   intensity sets where they have maybe just one or two repetitions in reserve, maybe going to failure on a
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.020]   few of those sets. What do you recommend women eat after they train?
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.180]   So we know that women who are in their reproductive years need around 35 grams of good
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.160]   protein, high quality leucine oriented protein within 45 minutes. And we see that women who are
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.800]   perimenopausal onwards are 40 to 60 grams because we become more anabolically resistant to food and
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.060]   exercise as we get older. Um, when we look at like the recovery window for food, there are definitely
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.740]   sex differences because we hear all the conversation of there's no recovery window. It's, you know,
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.300]   it's old science, but we look at the research of when women's metabolisms come back down to baseline,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.760]   meaning that they have constant straight blood sugar levels versus men, women it's within, uh, 60 minutes.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.500]   And for men, it's up to three hours. So when we're looking at the data that says there's no
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.120]   mental window per se for getting food in, it's based on male data. So when we're looking at women,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.580]   women, we have this tighter window to stop that breakdown effect and start the reparation.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.740]   Um, so yeah, it's like when we're talking about the protein intake, it's really important not only to
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.280]   get that leucine content up in the muscle to start the reparation and repair, but also again, to signal
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.120]   that, yeah, we're in a building state. We're not holding that catabolic state and increasing all the
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:18.340]   repercussions that come with it. So women should try and get 30 or as much as 40, maybe 50 grams of
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:26.620]   protein depending on their age, post-training within an hour of training. Yep. Men seem to have a longer
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.020]   window. They could wait an hour, two hours, maybe even three hours before ingesting protein. What
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.680]   about carbohydrate? We look at mixed, but for men, it's more important because they go through their
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.060]   liver and muscle glycogen so much faster than women. So when we look at women, we want to get around 0.3
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:51.160]   grams per kilo, um, of carbohydrate within two hours of finishing. So we look at protein and people
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.180]   like, well, that's a big dose of protein. How do I get it all in? It's like, yeah, well, you can look at
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.000]   how we mix all of these things. You're also getting carbohydrate in with that. So that's why I say you
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.400]   could have your next meal after your training session. Um, yeah, there's a time and a place for
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.220]   protein supplementation, but if you're getting that real food and then you're also getting,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.460]   you know, your magnesium and your potassium and your sodium and all the things that people supposedly
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:24.380]   lose and you're able to also repair a lot better. At some point, there was a lot of discussion about
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:31.660]   training fasted burns more body fat. Um, I think now most people accept that that's not the case,
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.600]   that perhaps the percentage of fat as fuel is increased when one trains fasted,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:46.740]   but that overall in terms of loss of body fat, it doesn't matter if you train fasted or you train fed.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.720]   Correct. Okay. I think, um, that can't be stated enough by experts like you. Um,
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.440]   that doesn't mean that if one prefers to train fasted or with a minimum of food in their gut,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.220]   that they can't do that. Like I like to train fasted, but I, what I'm hearing is that women
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.340]   should probably ingest at least some protein, high quality protein, and maybe drink the protein in a
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.600]   protein shake form if they don't want to ingest solid food. Yeah. I think the easiest way for people
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.240]   to understand the basic idea of what low energy is and how this affects men and women is when we are
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.840]   looking at, um, a tipping point for endocrine dysfunction for men, we're seeing that tipping
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:36.320]   point at 15 calories per kilogram of fat-free mass for women, it's 30. So when we're looking
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.440]   at baseline calorie needs before you really get into that endocrine dysfunction, when you're looking
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.140]   at those parameters, you can see why men do better in a fasted state or a low calorie state.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:53.200]   But for women, our intake and especially our carbohydrate needs are so much higher
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   because we have so many other functions that are reliant on that kispeptin upregulation or
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.980]   downregulation, preferably upregulation. Um, so when we're just talking the basic calorie needs
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.900]   and what we're seeing, it's that dichotomy right there of 15 to 30. And when you start telling people
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.420]   that, they're like, Oh, okay, I get it. Is that a biological aspect? It's like, well, you could
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.700]   trace it all the way back where, you know, men went out to get the calories and most tribes and the women
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.620]   were home and it wasn't advantageous to be pregnant under low calorie intake. That's why you have
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.360]   dysfunction when the calories are too low. But, you know, you can also feed forward to modern day now.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.300]   And you're seeing that all this perturbance of hormone and the way we regulate hormone across the
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.820]   circadian rhythm requires more calories for women than it does for men.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.500]   I know some men that basically don't eat all day and then eat one meal in the evening and they'll
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.160]   train in the morning. That's inconceivable to me because within an hour or so of training, I'm hungry.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:03.320]   I know some men that don't eat all day and they'll eat all day and eat all day and eat all day.
