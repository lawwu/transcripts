[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We're joined this week on the podcast by parenting expert Ted Tripp and Dr. Tripp,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   the topic of physical punishment and raising children is in the news here in Minnesota
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.760]   right now with the recent issues surrounding Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and the
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.040]   accusations that he left his four-year-old son with dozens of wounds on his legs, clearly
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.360]   crossing a line of what is reasonable for physical discipline.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.660]   But most people seem to see a difference between discipline and abuse, but situations like
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.140]   Peterson expose a lot of folks in culture who simply want to do away with spanking altogether.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.760]   If there's a chance it can be done wrong, let's not do it at all.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.240]   So speak to this biblically.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.960]   What's the purpose of reasonable physical discipline in raising children, the rod, as
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.000]   the Bible calls it, and maybe share with us your own story as a young parent and how you
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.080]   came to embrace this practice rather reluctantly.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.960]   Well, I think spanking is a very, very unpopular topic.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.360]   I often laugh about this.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   I've been teaching on this.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.840]   First time I ever taught a series and talked about spanking was in 1976.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.960]   I've talked about it more times than I can remember.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.400]   I'm losing the battle because fewer and fewer Christian people are willing to embrace it.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:28.120]   It's a hard thing for us in our culture, but I know my personal story is I came of
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.560]   age in the late 60s.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.120]   I got married in 1968.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.680]   I had a son in 1969.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.760]   I had very much imbibed while I was a Christian, I had still very much imbibed the thoughts
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.880]   of the age, "Be a free spirit," and all that kind of stuff.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.960]   So I wasn't going to do anything to curb my young son, who was born in 1969.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.320]   By the early 70s, we were in trouble.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.200]   This kid was wild and unruly.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.680]   We heard teaching from the Word of God that talked about spanking and took us through
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.040]   the passages in Proverbs, and we were very compelled by those passages.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.880]   I remember wrestling with this, Tony, wrestling with the fact that I did not want to spank
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.880]   my children.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.600]   I didn't want anything within me.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.760]   My whole political and social philosophy of life was completely contrary to what I could
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.320]   see God was calling me to do.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.080]   I was brought, I don't want to say kicking and screaming, but I was brought reluctantly
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.720]   to embrace what God had called me to do and try to sort out, "How do I do this?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.440]   In ways that are gracious and appropriate and not destructive?"
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.200]   That son is now 45 years old.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.160]   I cannot imagine what his life would be or our lives with our other two children would
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.240]   have been if we had never gotten a hold of this biblical truth.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.720]   So I think one of the reasons why I'm an advocate of spanking is I'm persuaded it's what God
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.280]   calls us to do, and it's a matter of faith and obedience for me.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.240]   But I think, what's the purpose of it?
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.200]   I think spanking, especially with little children, and I think that spanking is most effective
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.480]   with younger children, spanking gets their attention.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.920]   It gives weight to your words.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.720]   It humbles them.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.400]   They want to avoid it, and it becomes a very effective way, particularly with little children
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.520]   where you can't really reason with them and they're not capable of complex reasoning.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.040]   It's a very effective way of helping them to understand the importance of obeying mommy
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   and daddy.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:59.240]   So I think that it's indispensable in those early years, particularly.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.600]   Now as kids get older, they get more stoic about it, and what it would take to make the
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.560]   same impression, say, on a 12-year-old that you make on a 2-year-old with a couple of
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.040]   swats on the fatty part of his bottom, you would have to be doing something very excessive
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800]   with a 12-year-old.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.520]   So I think, obviously, as kids get older, we're going to turn to other things.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.040]   But I think in those early years, there is no substitute for it.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.880]   And the nice thing, too, with spanking is that when a child is spanked, it's over.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.240]   He is disciplined.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.120]   I talk about steps to take in the book "Shepherding a Child's Heart," but he's disciplined.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.240]   And then you take him up on your lap, you tell him how much you love him, you assure
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.240]   him.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.720]   I used to say to my kids, "Daddy hates to spank you.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.520]   I hope I never have to spank you again."
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.000]   I told them that hundreds of times.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.800]   And by and by, the day came when they didn't require that kind of discipline.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   And I think the nice thing with spanking is that when you're done, you restore the child,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   you hug him, you pray with him, it's over.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   He's not in the doghouse.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   You don't have to ask yourself if you do something fun later in the day.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   Should we bring him along?
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.600]   After all, he was bad this morning.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.280]   No, that was done.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.760]   It's been carried forth behind us.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.200]   We're moving on.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:32.760]   I think it is just such a much more freeing way to interact with kids and be able to put
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.880]   the discipline behind you and move on than other methods of discipline like time out
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.160]   that requires time or sitting on the chair, and no one can talk to you when you're on
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.480]   the chair and that kind of stuff.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:54.520]   I think that in my mind is much more destructive than a gracious, timely, appropriate use of
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.920]   physical discipline with little kids.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.000]   I was blessed to have been raised in a home where I did get disciplined as a kid for defiant
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.360]   behavior at least a few times.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.600]   And my kids love hearing stories of when dad got spanked as a kid.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.520]   And I find that whenever there's a lack of attention in family worship, I know I can
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.640]   just weave in one of those spanking stories into whatever we're talking about.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.120]   Even if I've told the story 10,000 times, I know it will arrest their attention.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.240]   Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.840]   Our kids, all three of our kids, well, we're the only children that have children, but
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   all three of our kids were spanked.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   And I have nine grandchildren.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.600]   They've all been spanked.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.200]   And they are happy children.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.400]   My children are not abusive parents.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.640]   So it does really bear good fruit for kids.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   Amen.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640]   Thank you, Dr. Tripp.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.920]   And for more on physical discipline, see Chapter 11 of Ted Tripp's bestselling book, Shepherding
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   a Child's Heart.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.000]   There he addresses those key biblical passages in Proverbs, like Chapter 13, verse 24, and
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.480]   19, 18, and 22, 15, and 23, 13 to 14, and of course, Proverbs 29, 17, which says, "Discipline
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.920]   your son, and he will give you rest.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.800]   He will give delight to your heart."
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.520]   That is a sweet word.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.000]   But speaking of discipline, what are the greatest hurdles for parents who refuse to use physical
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   discipline?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.840]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
