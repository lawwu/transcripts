[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   The best thing you can do is an act of service.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.360]   And what I mean by that is help somebody
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.560]   who's struggling with the same thing as you.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.880]   When I wrote Leader's Eat Last,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.080]   I went and looked at Alcoholics Anonymous,
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.120]   amazing organization.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.280]   Alcoholics Anonymous has a 12-step program
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.320]   to help you beat your addiction.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.000]   Most people will know the first step,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.880]   admit you have a problem.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.580]   I don't have any friends, I don't know how to make friends.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.420]   Okay, that's step one.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.200]   But the magical thing about Alcoholics Anonymous
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.440]   and all of those 12-step programs is they know this.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.620]   They have the data, which is if you master 11 steps,
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.860]   but not the 12th, you're probably gonna succumb
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.700]   to the disease.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.520]   But if you master the 12th step,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.740]   you're more likely to beat it.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.980]   What's the 12th step?
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.280]   The 12th step is to help another alcoholic.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.120]   Service.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.140]   So don't worry about you.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.980]   I got it.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.800]   You're struggling to make friends,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.640]   you don't know how to make friends.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.480]   I got it.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.800]   Find somebody you know who's also struggling
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.480]   to make friends and wishes they could make friends
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.320]   and help them.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.160]   And the act of service of helping them solve the problem
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760]   that you're struggling with will solve your problem.
