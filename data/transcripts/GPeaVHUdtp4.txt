[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   I had three big takeaways for you.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.420]   One deals pop up all the time, even for primetime travel.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.320]   I was looking for flights to Europe for five people direct in business
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.040]   class in the summer, which is a very hard time to find awards.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.400]   I got multiple options in the 45 to 75, 80,000 point range for that over the
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.720]   course of a couple of weeks on short notice, takeaway number two, don't forget
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   that because you find a flight on one airline, like United in my case, it absolutely
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.440]   does not mean you need to book it through United's award program.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.600]   And in many cases, it's going to be a much worse deal.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000]   Takeaway number three, there is so much value in having transferable points,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.160]   especially across multiple programs.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.720]   In my example, if I didn't have chase points, then I wouldn't have gotten the
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.960]   20% aero plan transfer bonus, or have even been able to transfer to United.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.000]   If that was the best option, if I didn't have Amex points, I couldn't
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640]   you've gotten the 15% bonus to life miles.
