[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Welcome back to the podcast. I hope you had an edifying weekend. We're going to start
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.080]   the week with a missions question, and it's this. Did the Apostle Paul say that the gospel
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.320]   had already reached the ends of the world in his own lifetime? It appears that he did
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.200]   say that, and it raises implications about the urgency of the Great Commission today.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.400]   Here's the question. "Pastor John, hello. My name is Kevin, and I live in Chicago. My
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.280]   question has to do with Paul's words in Colossians 1.6, where he speaks of the gospel that has
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.560]   "come to you as indeed in the whole world." He maybe suggested that the gospel had already
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.280]   reached the whole world in his lifetime. It seems clearer in Colossians 1.23. There Paul
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.400]   speaks of the hope of the gospel that you heard "which has been proclaimed in all creation
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.760]   under heaven." Wow. So, what does Paul mean when he says that the hope of the gospel has
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.960]   already been proclaimed in all creation? I feel an urgency to unreached nations, but
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   these texts have dampened that urgency in me some. Can you explain what Paul means here?
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   Thank you.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.100]   Well, bless you, Kevin, for the sense of urgency that you feel. And yes, I think I can explain
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:32.100]   it and not only explain it, I hope I can explain it in a way that intensifies your commitment
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.240]   to reach the nations rather than dampening that commitment. So, let's take these two
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.480]   passages one at a time. First, Colossians 1.5 and 6 says, "Of this," referring to
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   the hope laid up for you in heaven, "of this you have heard before in the word of
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.400]   truth the gospel, which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.260]   and increasing, as it also does among you, since the day you heard it and understood
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.520]   the grace of God in truth." Notice what that text does not say. It does not say that
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.100]   the gospel has already been preached in the whole world. It does not say that the gospel
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.360]   has reached to the ends of the world. It simply says that the gospel which has come to you,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.000]   Colossians, is the very gospel that is bearing fruit and increasing everywhere it goes in
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.160]   the whole world. The point is not that he has finished going through the whole world.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   The point is that it's the kind of gospel that goes through the whole world, and wherever
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.800]   it goes, it bears fruit and increases. Now, to underline that we're on the right track
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   in saying that, we just need to remember that Paul said, Paul himself said later in Romans
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   15, 20 to 24, this, "I make it my ambition to preach the gospel not where Christ has
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation. This is the reason why
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.280]   I have so often been hindered in coming to you. But now, since I no longer have any room
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.200]   for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, I hope
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.760]   to see you in passing as I go to Spain and to be helped on my journey there by you once
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.200]   I have enjoyed your company for a while." In other words, Paul knew very well that the
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.080]   gospel had not reached Spain, at least not to any significant degree, because he wants
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.360]   to preach the gospel where the gospel has not been preached, and that's why he's going
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   to Spain. Paul had no notion that the gospel had already been preached throughout the whole
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.120]   world. So the really crucial question in Colossians
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:28.320]   6 is why Paul went out of his way to say that very gospel which had come to Colossae was
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.760]   also making its way fruitfully through the whole world. Why did he say that? And I think
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.920]   there are three reasons. Number one, the gospel is not merely local, not merely tribal, not
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.400]   parochial, not limited to any one tribe or class or ethnicity or language or culture
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.920]   or city like Colossae. The point is, this gospel that you have believed, you Colossians,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:02.320]   in your little out-of-the-way town of Colossae is a triumphant, global gospel laying claim
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.640]   on every single person and people group in the whole world wherever it goes. Don't
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   think you've embraced a little thing. That's number one.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.280]   Number two, Paul said this, namely that it's spreading throughout the whole world and increasing
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.880]   the gospel. He said it to underline the fact that there is a great, glorious Creator God
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.720]   behind the gospel who is laying claim on the entire creation. He's not a tribal deity.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.040]   When you believe the gospel, you believe in the God of the universe who has no serious
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.400]   rivals. You won't ever run into another religion, wherever you go. You won't ever
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.600]   run into another religion anywhere in the world that can nullify the gospel, compromise
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   the gospel.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.880]   And the third reason I think he talks this way and stresses the global dimension of the
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:00.240]   gospel for the Colossians is to show that it is the power, this gospel has power, to
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.160]   change people of every kind, all kinds of people. It's not just effective among one
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.040]   kind of humanity, but will bear fruit among every single kind of humanity that it runs
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.520]   into all the unimaginable differences in the world that there are today and that there
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.840]   were then. Therefore, it is a great gospel. That, I think, is the point of Colossians
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:38.200]   1.6 when he says, "As indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing."
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.840]   Now, let's look at Colossians 1.23. I'm going to read the ESV. I think this is a
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.720]   bigger problem for most people than verse 6, but it has a very simple solution if we
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.320]   could just get everybody to translate it the same way. Okay, here's verse 23. "You
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.960]   have been reconciled to God, if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.560]   not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard." And here comes the problem
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.160]   part. This is the ESV. "Which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven,"
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.720]   yikes, "and of which I, Paul, became a minister." Now, that's a real stumbling
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:27.160]   block for lots of people to read in their translation in verse 23 that the gospel in
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.120]   the first century, halfway through the first century, has been proclaimed in all creation
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:43.440]   under heaven. And it's amazing to me how many commentators try to squeeze that stunning
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.200]   statement into the first century and say something like, "Well, really, the gospel had reached
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.000]   to what the first century people assumed was all creation under heaven," to which I
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.520]   delicately say, "Baloney." I say that not only because they weren't that ignorant.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.040]   They really weren't that ignorant of the rest of the world. But I say it mainly because
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.960]   Paul—we already saw this—Paul himself said in Romans 15 that he was intending to
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:24.280]   proclaim the gospel in a vast region of Gaul called Spain where there hadn't been yet
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.640]   the preaching of the gospel. So he didn't believe that the gospel had been preached
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:37.480]   in all creation under heaven. So what's the solution? The solution is that the translation
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:46.240]   which has been proclaimed is not at all the most natural translation. Baffles me why translations
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.880]   give it that meaning, a temporal meaning, which has been proclaimed. That's translating
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:03.120]   two Greek words—the proclaimed, the proclaimed, to kairoukventos, the proclaimed. That's
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   all it's translating, the proclaimed. It is a straightforward, aorist, passive, participle,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:17.400]   in agreement with the word gospel. Both of them are genitive, singular, and thus clarifying.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:24.840]   It clarifies and defines the kind of gospel we're talking about. With the article "the"
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:31.480]   in front of the participle, it is not an adverbial participle telling when. There's nothing
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   temporal about it. It doesn't say "has been proclaimed." That's not in the word
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:48.520]   at all. Very literally, it would read like this, "The gospel that you heard, the proclaimed
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   one in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister." So the solution
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.760]   is that Paul is not saying anything about when the gospel is proclaimed in all creation.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:11.920]   Rather, he's saying that's the kind of gospel it is. That's what's happening.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.040]   It is the kind of gospel that is proclaimed under all creation, under heaven. In other
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.960]   words, the meaning is virtually the same as chapter 1, verse 6, "As indeed in the whole
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:30.920]   world it is bearing fruit and increasing." Paul is emphasizing the fact that the gospel,
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.480]   embraced by this little group of people in this little town of Colossae, is the very
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:46.240]   gospel that is proclaimed in all creation under heaven. God is laying claim on the entire
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:55.560]   creation, and you are being swept up into that glorious plan. It does not say "has
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.160]   been proclaimed." It is proclaimed in all creation. Everywhere it goes, it is being
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.880]   proclaimed and it is bearing fruit. So Kevin, in Chicago, don't lose your sense
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:17.000]   of urgency or your sense of confidence that the gospel you believe can be taken, should
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.400]   be taken, must be taken to every people group on the planet. It will be as relevant there
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:33.120]   as it is in your own heart, with tremendous power. It is a gospel bearing fruit in the
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:40.920]   whole world. It is a gospel proclaimed in all creation under heaven. And when that's
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.000]   finished, Jesus says, "The end will come." Yes, so wonderful urgency remains. Thank you,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.240]   Pastor John, for that response. And Kevin, thank you for the very astute Bible question.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.960]   And thank you all for joining us on the podcast today. You can ask an astute Bible question
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:05.800]   of your own. You can search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast, all at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:12.040]   Speaking of missions, we are back on Wednesday to look at how we can escape the love of safety
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.600]   and embrace risk in service to others. It's an important discussion. I'm your host, Tony
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.120]   Rehnke, and we will see you back here on Wednesday. Thanks for listening.
