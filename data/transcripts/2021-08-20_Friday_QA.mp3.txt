[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.800]   is Friday, August 20, 2021, and today, we do live Friday calling show. You call in,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.200]   we talk anything you want.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:26.880]   If you're new to the show, I want to welcome you to today's episode. Every week here
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.160]   at Radical Personal Finance, in which I can arrange an appropriate internet connection
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   and the necessary technology to record the show, each Friday that I can do that, we record
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.840]   a live Q&A show. It works just like call-in talk radio. You call in, we chat about anything
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.480]   that you want, any question that you want to talk about, anything that's on your mind,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.000]   any topic. Really, I don't screen the calls at all. I just go to the phone lines and we
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.560]   talk. If you'd like to join me for one of these Friday Q&A shows, I would love you to
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.120]   do that. The way that you get into one of these is by going to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   sign up there as a patron of the show on Patreon, and that will gain you access to these Friday
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.640]   Q&A calls. I do that to keep the numbers to a manageable level, so that they come out
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.480]   to somewhere between an hour and two and a half, I guess, honestly, but I try to keep
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.400]   them to about an hour or so, and so that keeps the number of callers manageable. So go to
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.040]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance if you would like to sign up there. We begin today with
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.240]   Caleb in Illinois. Caleb, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   sir?
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.440]   Hi. So I'm 21 and I am engaged and I just bought my first property. It's five acres
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.480]   in a semi-rural area. And my concerns recently have been on physical preparedness more than
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.160]   financial preparedness. I've dived into a lot of your episodes going back, talking about
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.120]   scanning and the alpha strategy. And I was wondering if you had any updated beliefs on
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   all those systems.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   Good question. So in the short answer, yes, I do have updated beliefs. My beliefs are
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   even stronger that it's a useful tool of preparedness. In fact, just this week, I actually recorded
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   a podcast episode and I released it. About 150 of you saw it come in and started listening
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.120]   to it, maybe actually a few hundred of you, called the barbell strategy. And the basic
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.340]   idea is that I have developed a new personal philosophy of risk management where my single
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.120]   biggest regret from when I was younger is that I have behaved too conservatively with
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.180]   my money. I didn't choose to be as aggressive as I could have. I didn't go after opportunities
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.600]   that I believe I could have. And I just was excessively conservative out of a desire to
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.580]   not lose money. But in the final analysis, what I've realized is there's really no reason
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.320]   in the modern world for anybody to be conservative financially. The consequences of failure on
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.200]   a practical level are quite low. They're very, very low. Now, the consequences of failure
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.240]   usually that we're worried about are not practical consequences. Rather, they are consequences
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.800]   that are more psychological, right? I'm scared of failure because I don't want to look like
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.640]   a loser in front of other people. I want to seem like a winner. And so I'm scared to take
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.200]   a risk because I'm scared of failure. That's a psychological issue to overcome, not a practical
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.600]   issue to overcome. So I believe that the consequences of failure have never been lower for most
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   of us and that it's actually quite easy to ensure against most of the consequences of
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   financial failure. And so if we can do that and we can put in place an appropriate insurance
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.760]   scheme to protect ourselves against financial failure, then we can give ourselves more permission
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.640]   to be aggressive with our investment strategies, aggressive with our speculation, aggressive
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.040]   with our business buildings, etc. And so one of the pillars of that insurance portfolio
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.380]   that I see is to take care of the basic needs of all times. And so as I see it, the basic
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.000]   needs are those things that we worry about. What would I do if I went homeless? What would
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   I do if I were hungry? How would I feed my children if I ran out of money, etc.? And
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.680]   so practical physical preparedness, stockpiling of relevant items, I think solves that insurance
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.920]   need better than almost anything else. So at the beginning stage, if I were 21 years
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.740]   old, newly engaged, just bought a property, something as simple as putting a debt-free
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.240]   couple thousand dollar camper that I found, a fifth wheel camper on my property, means
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.760]   that unless a tornado rips the thing away, I'm always going to have some kind of housing.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.440]   Putting in place six months of beans and rice and wheat and corn, setting aside a thousand
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.080]   bucks worth of long-term storage food so that I will always have calories. This makes a
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.440]   lot of sense. Putting those basic preparedness items in place makes a lot of sense. And I
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:21.120]   think that by doing that, you should put yourself in a situation where you're relatively bulletproof
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.160]   and thus are able to take more financial risk. As I look at the world, in some ways, we're
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.480]   more connected to the financial world than ever before. Meaning it's hard to live without
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.160]   money and making money and having money, etc. But the flip side of that is it seems in some
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   ways easier than ever before to live comfortably. If you and your fiancé had a few thousand
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.520]   dollar fifth wheel trailer, you could have a roof over your head on raw land that is
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.360]   more comfortable than most of our forebears ever had. You could be totally comfortable
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.240]   and yet for a few thousand bucks, you've secured that. In addition, you can put a cell phone
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.240]   hotspot there and you have access to the world's best entertainment. You can put a little generator
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.800]   in the backyard and a little battery backup system and have access to easy electricity.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.820]   And so you can insure yourself pretty easily against those things. And then my concept
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:31.160]   is that now you should feel more comfortable knowing that your basic needs are met. You
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.400]   should feel more comfortable speculating. You should feel more comfortable investing
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.080]   aggressively. You should feel more comfortable really going for it financially. So instead
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.640]   of sitting back and worrying about building up a few thousand dollars, then you're really
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.720]   going for it with big investments where you're headed for an eight-figure net worth.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.800]   Now the one thing I would say is I don't believe that it's necessary here to be excessive.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:05.840]   So you could lay out and say, "What is my alpha strategy?" Well, the classic concept
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.960]   of the alpha strategy is basically buy everything you're going to need for the rest of your
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.160]   life. I do think that at 21 years old, that would be a mistake because what that would
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:23.120]   probably do is encumber you with a significant investment into physical possessions, which
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   could lead to decreased mobility and a general kind of heaviness of living. A friend of mine
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.360]   calls his lifestyle the low-drag lifestyle. I've always loved that. Living low-drag, having
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.240]   simplicity in your personal effects. That's hard to do if you've got three extra sets
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.880]   of tires in the barn because you wanted to buy a lifetime supply of tires. And so I don't
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.960]   think that a 21-year-old really should go hardcore and try to go in the sense of buy
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.040]   everything you're going to need for the rest of your life. But I do think that having some
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.000]   focus on physical preparedness is actually a valuable strategy to free you up so that
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.440]   you can move much more aggressively in your business and investing affairs.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:18.200]   Yeah, that makes total sense. That's kind of what I was wondering is, do you believe
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.400]   that if you have almost a Dave Ramsey 1,000 saved, should you switch over to the physical
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.840]   and then worry afterwards? So you've got three months of supplies saved up, then you can
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.080]   go to those more risky investments?
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.640]   How much money do you earn per year at the moment?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.240]   Combined it's about $65,000.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.000]   And this land that you bought, you said you bought five acres, does it have a house on
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   it?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It does.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.720]   Great. So do you have a mortgage on the property?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.920]   Yes.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   And how big is that?
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   It's $180,000.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:10:01.640]   Okay. Yeah, so I think $1,000 is too little. There's no question that having $1,000 is
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:10.480]   very, very useful. But I think my number is $10,000. It's hard for me to... With $10,000,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:18.120]   there's not a lot that I can't see you're able to do. At under $10,000 though, it starts
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:24.440]   to get a little bit thin. And so I think the first number I would say is you should build
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.400]   up to $10,000 in savings should be a first goal before you do any kind of investments,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.040]   right?
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.200]   Physical preparedness though is kind of a mixed bag, right? What are we talking about?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.980]   Are we talking about going and... I'm not talking about really anything that's expensive.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.600]   You probably have already some stuff. If you're buying a house, one of the first things you're
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.640]   going to need is a few tools to work on it and fix on it, et cetera. And if you're moving
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.800]   into semi-rural five acre environment, that's probably normal. And so get good at buying
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.280]   things cheap, paying for things for cash. Okay, a little bit of food stockpile, but
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.920]   a couple thousand bucks buys you a lot of food for two people. And I would focus in
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:11.680]   the early years, I would focus on just doing that the cheap way, right? Get the sacks of
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:19.360]   beans and corn and wheat and rice and put them in a Mylar bag, put them in a bucket
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.120]   and stick them aside, right? A little bit of extra normal food in the pantry type of
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.640]   thing. Don't go and spend thousands of dollars on the expensive, fun, freeze-dried storage
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.080]   food. Grab yourself a little generator, but you pick up cheap at a garage sale. At $65,000
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:42.000]   of income, I think that your best bet is to stockpile money. And then when you find good
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.800]   deals, spend a few thousand dollars here and there on physical preparedness. But I think
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.000]   money is in most cases your most useful tool. So I don't have a formula that I would give.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   I would just say if you find a good deal, get it. If you come across a great deal on
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.040]   a backup generator, meaning not a whole house, just a little portable generator somewhere,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.360]   pick it up. It doesn't matter how much savings you have. Because at this level of finances,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.280]   these things that we're talking about are easily turned into money if you want to. And
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.200]   so I look at, let's say you're on Facebook Marketplace and somebody's selling a little
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.460]   2,000 watt Honda generator, and you can pick it up for $350. Well, that's as good as money.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.520]   You can put that thing back on Facebook Marketplace any day you want, and you can turn it into
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   $350 and you won't lose much. And so I don't have a formula to say here's all the things
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:36.320]   that you need to buy. I just know that having some things covered is useful. But then what
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:43.560]   I would do is create some stability, save $10,000 or so, and then focus and say, "How
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.880]   can we go for it?" This is what I wish I had done at 21, is how can I go for it, not
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.080]   be conservative, knowing that I might lose money, my businesses might fail, my investments
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.840]   might fail, but how can I go for it? Because at 21, there will never be a time in your
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.160]   life where the risk is easier to handle. There will never be fewer obstacles in your way.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.720]   And so when you go for it, as whatever that means in your context, go for it in your career,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.320]   go for it in your investments, whatever it is, go for it. Because if it fails, it's no
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:26.280]   big deal. You're going to be fine. That philosophy really is the same at every stage, but it
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.920]   becomes more psychologically difficult down the road. So I hope that was clear enough.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.760]   I don't have a perfect answer for you. I would do both. If I came across a great deal on
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.640]   something that fit into my personal physical stockpiling strategy, I would grab it. And
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.560]   I would do it, but I would just be cautious that I don't overdo the physical stuff and
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:52.320]   underdo the money. Money is a valuable preparedness tool, and it's the thing that buys everything
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.000]   else that you need.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.560]   Yeah, that sounds reasonable to me. Would you say someone at this life or at this stage
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.660]   in life, would it be better to, in my free time, try to find something else to create
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.660]   more income?
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.660]   What kind of work do you do?
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:16.860]   Get the money, or would it be... I do design for construction.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.440]   Design for construction, meaning like architectural drawings, CAD stuff? What does that mean?
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.320]   CAD stuff and conceptual stuff.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   Do you feel like this is a career that you're well suited for?
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.800]   Currently. Long-term goals are very different.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.160]   Tell me about your long-term goals then.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:50.340]   Longer term would be establish small-time spin farming or getting to my own homestead
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.480]   and just basically having enough to coast on and satisfy my needs with that profit.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.440]   So your vision is to work a very modest amount, earning just enough money to cover your needs
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.280]   and doing that in activities that kind of give you a general lifestyle that you prefer.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   Is that right?
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:17.760]   Yes. And this current job that I'm in, what career that I'm in, would be the initial bank
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.800]   role for most of the things that I would need, land and equipment, to hopefully not take
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.240]   on debt right at the beginning.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:35.360]   So why don't... Do you have a desire to... Why at 21 years old do you want to do just
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.040]   enough to get by?
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:49.200]   I'm not very much into luxuries. I feel comfortable at a frugal level. So if I were to have enough
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.480]   to buy myself a certain acreage that I could just work on, that work is a fulfilling work
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.440]   to me. I know you always talk about work towards something that you don't want to retire from
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.680]   and that's something I could see doing for the rest of my life.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.760]   I think one of the things that you'll have to do here is you have to test this. And so
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:15.160]   the advice I would give is as quickly as possible, get yourself into the lifestyle that is your
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:21.320]   ambition and try it out and do it as quickly as possible so that you can see if that's
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.200]   actually for you.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.840]   I'll just simply share what I think is probably the case in many circumstances that are like
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.960]   yours. Notice I'm trying to be cautious. I'm trying to not tell you what your goals are,
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.880]   what your desired lifestyle is. But here's what I have learned.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:52.280]   I think that if I put 10 young men in a room and of those 10 young men that told me, "I
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:58.560]   want to do just enough to get by. I don't have big materialistic ambitions. I'd rather
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:05.920]   kind of live a day-to-day existence." I think that 2 of the 10 probably actually mean it
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.280]   and 8 of the 10 simply have not found something that turns them on yet. They haven't found
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.960]   something that they genuinely want to do. They haven't found something where they believe
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.160]   they could actually contribute.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:27.920]   I understand the desire to live a simple lifestyle like you're describing. I had it when I was
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.760]   in my early to mid-20s. I had a goal. I was like, "I didn't like being at work and if
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.160]   you told me at that time that I could build and develop a self-sufficient homestead and
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.760]   that would be kind of what I did." At the time, it seemed like a dream that I had and
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.200]   I thought that was what I really wanted.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.880]   What I have learned though, continuing on the process, is it was actually a lot simpler.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:58.800]   I wasn't in a job that gave me any opportunity to really indulge my sense of ambition and
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:05.240]   I was trying to escape from a daily schedule that I didn't like. At this point, it's obvious
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.600]   to me that just working on a self-sufficient homestead was not for me. Rather, what was
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.160]   better and more important was for me to get into a job where there was more of an opportunity
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.040]   to grow and that I was just in a bad job for me, not that I needed to get out of the work
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   world.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.600]   This was some of my own thinking as it changed over time with regard to the financial independence
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.240]   space. A number of years ago when I was in my mid and late 20s, I would sit and consume
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:40.000]   nothing but early retirement blogs because I thought I wanted to retire early. Once I
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.080]   discovered the concepts of it, then it felt like, "Wow, this is my ticket out." But now,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:53.240]   in hindsight, I see that I was simply in a career that didn't match my ambition and that
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.040]   had me too constrained.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.560]   At this point in time, I have walked away from any ambition of retiring early. I've
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:08.360]   walked away from any ambition of living on a farm and just farming every day because
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.440]   I've realized that I need much bigger challenges. Since I've now created a lifestyle where I
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.080]   have the freedom to do what I want on a daily basis and I'm not constrained by someone else
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.720]   telling me something, now my goals have gotten a lot bigger.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.680]   I don't know if that's you or not. All I can say is test it as quickly as possible. The
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   two examples I would give would just simply be this. A lifestyle business, for example.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.200]   When I started Radical Personal Finance, my goal was to build a lifestyle business. I
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.920]   wanted something where I could earn $100,000 a year from a laptop. I did that. It took
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.000]   me a couple of years, but I did it. Once I got there, then I thought, "Wait a second.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.480]   Is this what I want?" I realized, "No, I want to have a bigger impact on the world.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.040]   I want to make a bigger mark. I want to be more useful."
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.800]   This isn't cutting it. This feels good. Yeah, okay, because I'm hanging out, but why am
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:07.240]   I going to waste my youth hanging out? I'm not tired. I'm not worn down. Why am I going
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.920]   to waste my youth and my strength hanging out? I want to make a bigger impact on the
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:17.880]   world. That doesn't have to be money, but money is a really good marker of how well
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:23.480]   you're serving the community around, how well you're serving people that you love. It's
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   a really useful marker. I'm glad that I achieved it relatively quickly so I could realize,
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   "No, I actually want to make a bigger impact."
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.920]   The second thing was I remember a number of years ago. My goal personally was oftentimes
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.680]   I always saw myself living out in the country on a little ranch. A few years ago, a little
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.920]   ranchette that came for sale in the United States, and I was like, "This is perfect
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.280]   for me." I flew back to the United States. I went and looked at the ranch. I just remember
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.120]   just walking around the ranch. On paper, it was everything that I had ever dreamed. I
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.480]   looked at it and I said, "You know what? This isn't for me. I used to think this was,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.720]   but it's not for me." Those two experiences gave me a sense of clarity of the future where
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.880]   it allowed me to say, "Okay, I'm going to abandon those goals and go backwards."
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.100]   To me, it's strange that a 21-year-old man wouldn't be burning with ambition to make
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.280]   a mark on the world. Now, whether or not that includes finances, whether or not that includes
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   making millions of dollars or spending millions of dollars is kind of beside the point. I
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   want you to be filled with a sense of passion and impact and purpose to the extent that
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:42.080]   you can find it. That could be spin farming. That could be managing a property. I think
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.800]   just be careful and as quickly as possible test yourself actually doing those things
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.960]   so that you can see if that's actually a good fit for you, even to this point. Knowing what
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.200]   I now know, if I were 21 years old and I were working in a job that I wanted to retire from,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   like construction, I wanted to go be a spin farmer, as quickly as possible, meaning less
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   than a year, I would put myself in a position where I could just go and do it so I could
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.080]   get a sense if that was actually for me. If so, go for it or if not, build a different
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.960]   plan and a different goal. You may be one of the two of the ten that is contented with
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.760]   that kind of lifestyle. I'm not. I thought I was. I'm not. I'm one of the eight out of
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:25.720]   ten that wants to have the opportunity to grow and be bigger. I'm not saying one is
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:32.480]   right or one is wrong. I am saying test those things as quickly as possible. Especially
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:38.680]   in your youth, the quicker you can achieve parts of your goals that will help to show
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:44.000]   you whether they're actually your goals or not so that you can move with greater and
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.840]   greater certainty going forward in the future. Those are my thoughts. All right.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:57.440]   >>Jay: Yeah, sounds good. It sounds like maybe I should look more into developing something
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.000]   along the lines that Jack Spierko would have done instead of just being a personal farmer,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.120]   maybe doing what I can to help others and educate if that's what I actually want to
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   do.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:17.160]   >>Steve: You can create it, whatever it is that you want to do. I just believe that you
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.320]   want to make the bigger the goal, the more exciting it is for me. Again, this has been
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.600]   the theme of my life over the last couple of years, I've thought. I've realized I was
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.240]   too conservative. I was too conservative with my goals and too conservative with my finances
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:39.000]   and too conservative with my abilities. I have realized that playing a game at a bigger
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.840]   level is simply more fun. When you realize that it's all a game, then why not have the
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:54.320]   most fun possible? The bigger that you can go, the better. There are arguments against
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.000]   it. I'm the guy who has a podcast called Why You Should Probably Lower Your Financial Goals.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.920]   I stand by the thinking in that, but I have changed and grown and I've realized that the
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:14.080]   time that I feel the most alive is when I'm right on the edge of my ability. We all have
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.120]   different levels of ability, but the time that I feel the most alive is when I'm right
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   on the edge of my ability. I want to spend more and more of the coming years not pulling
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.160]   back to where I'm comfortable, but I want to spend more and more of the coming years
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:32.500]   growing and living continually on the edge of my ability so that when I look back decade
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:40.560]   by decade by decade, I can chart massive growth. That's my ambition. What that looks like has
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.040]   lots of different answers, but that's my personal ambition is to live on the edge of my ability.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.680]   Caleb, I love talking to you. Thank you. I think you're a new caller, new patron. I'd
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.280]   love to keep you keep calling in regularly and chat about some of this stuff because
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.800]   it's so exciting for all of us. I think that most of us who are 15 years or senior, you
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.720]   think, "Oh, if only I'd known at 21." It's exciting to hear from you. I'd love for you
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.840]   to call in regularly. All right, we've got a Trey in Texas. Trey, welcome to the show.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.480]   Hey, Joshua. That was a great conversation you guys just had. My question is going to
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:23.400]   be really boring compared to that. When you told them that you feel your best or you live
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.840]   your best when you're at the edge of your ability, I've always felt the same way. I
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   always say the same thing differently. I say I'm at my best when I'm in over my head.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   Right.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:41.120]   I totally agree. Mine will be pretty easy. I wanted your recommendation. It actually
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.600]   kind of ties into what you guys were just talking about, but I actually did buy the
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:53.000]   little ranch yet about a month ago. It's 109 acres. It's got two houses on it and a 10-acre
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.200]   pond. It's timberland. We're going to hunt out there. I'll have family and friends hunting
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:07.600]   and fishing. There's nobody that lives out there year-round. In the back of my mind,
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:13.800]   I've kind of felt this little bit of liability. What if some teenagers go out there and are
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.520]   swimming or something and something happens when nobody's around? I wondered if you had
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:29.600]   any specific sort of asset protection strategies for that scenario. Maybe hold it in an entity
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.640]   rather than my personal name or different insurances and that kind of thing.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.780]   I think the first thing is you start with the practical stuff. Before you ever talk
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:48.660]   about ownership, which certainly is an important topic, but with liability, you start by protecting
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.120]   your – the way that you begin liability planning is you lower your liability by doing
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.080]   the stuff you know you need to do. The first thing you do is you go out and you post the
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:05.240]   property with appropriate signage, right? No trespassing. Keep out. You make sure that
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   you have a proper gate if possible. Put a gate on your road. Even if there's no fence
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.440]   around it, put a gate on your road. You go out and you make sure there are no major hazards.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   There's no antique well that's uncovered. Go through and think what's all the bad stuff
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.880]   that could happen and then put in place protection for yourself. I really believe that's 80%
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:32.200]   of the battle is actually just doing stuff. One of the things that has bothered me so
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.600]   much over the years studying asset protection and looking at asset protection is this. You
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:46.880]   can find abundant horror stories, genuine cases where somebody got sued for something
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.640]   so ridiculous and you say, "How on earth did this ever get to court? How on earth did
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.320]   this person ever win?" Sometimes when you dig under the hood, you find that it's not
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.200]   as frivolous as it first appeared. The time-worn example of this is the classic McDonald's
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.500]   hot coffee case. I had grown up in my high school years hearing about the fact that somebody
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:18.040]   had sued McDonald's and won because this person poured hot coffee in her lap and she got burned
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.800]   and then she sued McDonald's. I thought, "Oh, frivolous lawsuit." Then in my business law
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:29.520]   class in college, we read the case, the case notes, the briefing, etc. We talked about
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.840]   it and I came away saying, "Wow, you know what? She was totally right. If I had been
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:42.480]   on the jury, I would have awarded her damages based upon the facts of the case, based upon
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:48.880]   the way that McDonald's dismissed her claims. She was totally right. This wasn't a frivolous
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.240]   lawsuit." Then when you actually follow the money through and everything, you realize,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.560]   "You know what? The justice system in the United States worked. It actually did work.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:02.900]   It did what it was supposed to do. It wasn't just a farce." I think my experience even
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:07.320]   talking to other people who've gone through law school is often similar. You go through
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.800]   training and you realize, "You know what? This system may be imperfect, but it generally
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:22.080]   works." When I read these frivolous cases in books selling asset protection planning
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.960]   ideas, I always ask myself, "How representative is this?" My answer is, "I don't know. I
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   have never found somebody who could tell me. I haven't found any way to analyze it."
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:39.440]   But I believe, just because it makes sense to me, I've got to believe that yes, there
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.680]   are cases where if I were on the jury, I would disagree with the outcome. There are clearly
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:50.440]   those cases. Often I'm scandalized when I actually do follow a case closely, something
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.640]   that's in the news and I sit and I watch the briefings every day and I listen to the arguments
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.720]   and then the jury comes to what I consider to be the wrong decision. I'm often really
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.840]   frustrated by that and it chips away at my faith for justice. But on these kinds of things,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.900]   I still think 80% of your battle is won by simply paying attention to things. Go out
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.040]   to the property, look at it and say, "What are all the things that could happen and how
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.720]   do I do it?" Put in place an expectation of privacy. That's what signage is about. That's
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.280]   what putting a gate up is about. That's what making sure that you lock the doors is about,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.240]   etc. And if you'll do that, you'll probably put most of the things that you need. So I
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.920]   think first of all, that's the first step. Second of all, I think minimize the target.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.960]   One of the problems with rural property is simply it's going to be broken into. There
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:45.280]   is no lock that can keep someone out if they have enough time and if they have privacy.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.760]   There is no lock, there is no door, there is no security system that can keep everyone
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:57.840]   out if they have enough time. So most security thinking is simply designed around slowing
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.280]   people down for enough time either for an alarm to activate and for law enforcement
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.640]   to arrive or slowing them down and making it frustrating enough that they're too worried
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.420]   about getting caught and so they leave. You know, the classic example, why do you go and
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:18.240]   buy a gun safe and put one in your basement to stick your guns and your passport into?
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.820]   You can get into a gun safe and the actual laboratory ratings are rated in something
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.800]   like five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes. The standards, when you actually look at the
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:35.600]   ratings and you look at a rated safe and you realize, oh, this safe is designed to keep
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.840]   two guys with ordinary tools out for ten minutes and thus it gets a level two rating. Forgive
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:47.260]   me, I can't give all the numbers off the top of my head, but I have looked at all the ratings.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:53.080]   And you say, wow, that's ridiculous. But still, it's valuable because if you can keep two
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:59.600]   ordinary guys out with ordinary tools for ten minutes, that gives ten more minutes and
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.080]   it dramatically cuts down on the amount of time that stuff is stolen. And so with a rural
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.460]   property, that problem comes into high relief because the thing that people have in a rural
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:17.000]   property is time and privacy, which means that you want to be very thoughtful about
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.280]   theft and what you have out there. If you had abundant personal property held at this
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.340]   location, then you need a caretaker. You need some way to have eyes on it. So if there's
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.660]   a neighbor who can't see it with 109 acres, perhaps not, you just need to be careful and
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.780]   make sure that nothing valuable is out there. If there is anything valuable, it needs to
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:44.260]   be hidden and concealed more than secured. Security is good, but hidden and concealed
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.440]   is better. And so you can strategize depending on the property. You can strategize different
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.120]   ways to do that. There are ways to conceal things in a home, ways to conceal things in
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:59.040]   a barn, ways to conceal things, etc. So I don't want to go too deeply into that. Just
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.000]   recognize that there's a good chance that that stuff is going to be taken.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.760]   Now, holding it in an entity. There are many good reasons to hold real estate in an entity.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:17.440]   Asset protection planning might be one, but it will depend on the state. I think, is this
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   property in Texas?
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.440]   No, it's in Arkansas.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:29.360]   Arkansas. So I'm just not competent enough to discuss the state level discussion of property
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.600]   in Arkansas. I think because, if I remember from a previous call, you own this with family
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.520]   members. I think here there is a good case for asset protection because you can put in
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:46.480]   place multiple owners. And so you can put in place a trust, depending on what your local
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.200]   legal advisor would recommend to you. Perhaps a land trust, perhaps a land trust mixed with
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.480]   an LLC in some capacity. I don't know the details on Arkansas law, but I would put it
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.720]   into an entity held and then distribute the shares among you and your co-owners so that
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:12.800]   there is multiple ownership. And so now you have a much higher protection from liability.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.560]   And then just make sure that the insurance is in place properly as well.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.080]   So is there going to be anything airtight? No, there's nothing that's airtight. But I
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.240]   think that 80% of the battle is just go out on the property and make sure that the stuff
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.960]   that should be done is done. And then put in place proper insurance protection with
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.880]   liability insurance and then put it into ownership. And that's as good as you're going
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880]   to get.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:45.400]   Yeah, that's actually exactly what I did the very first weekend after we closed. I went
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.280]   down there and locked everything up and put the signs up and did that kind of thing. So
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   I guess I'm 80% of the way there then.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.680]   Yeah, and then just fix the stuff.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:58.480]   Do you have an opinion on how much personal liability is reasonable? How much personal
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.000]   liability insurance protection?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.040]   I think you would answer that depending on the value of the property and then the value
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.440]   of your other assets that are not protected otherwise. So if you've got a million dollars
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.600]   sitting in cash in your personal bank account for whatever reason you have that, then you're
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:21.000]   well served by increasing your liability insurance across the board to a high number. If you
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.920]   got a million dollars sitting in a 401k, which is already protected from liability and no
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:32.080]   cash assets, then now I think you can be a bit more modest with your liability coverages.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.360]   So I would solicit the advice of a local property and casualty insurance agent and I would look
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.640]   at – I'm not trying to just backstep it, but there's no other answer – and I would
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.120]   look at my assets and say what's exposed and then what makes sense to protect based
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.040]   upon the amount of assets that are exposed.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.600]   All right, perfect. Thanks, Joshua.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.360]   Yeah, my pleasure. Congratulations on the property. I think there's a lot of cool stuff
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.880]   that you can do with a rural property and a lot of stuff – there are a lot of good
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.960]   ideas. What I would do is ask around in the prepper forums. There's some great prepper
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.480]   forums online and talk about the situation and see what ideas people have come up with
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.360]   for how to secure things at a rural property. Everything from totally underground shipping
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.480]   containers and bunkers and all kinds of stuff. You can put in place stuff to protect whatever
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.640]   it is that you want to have out there. But I think there's a lot of ideas. Just be
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:33.240]   aware of the fact that a lot of times when you have a rural property, there's going
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.200]   to be people wandering on it, right? Your local 15-year-old boys are going to be on
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.280]   the property. Most of them aren't there to cause trouble, but they're going to check
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.320]   it out. And if there's something really juicy looking, they'll check it out. And if there
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.840]   is something that someone knows is of value, then they have time and privacy, which means
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.920]   they ultimately can gain entrance. So anything that you put out there, you want to do it
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.320]   with that thought in mind.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.960]   We go to James in Georgia. James, welcome to the show. What can I serve you today, sir?
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:08.040]   Hey, Joshua. Really appreciate the good work that you do. And I had a couple of questions.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:13.480]   I can start with the first question, maybe if we have time to go to the second. The first
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:21.400]   question that I have is around saving for retirement now versus saving up for a house.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:27.720]   And a little bit of context for you. I'm 27 years old. I make about $80,000 per year and
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:35.840]   spend about $40,000 per year in after-tax expenses. And then right now, in terms of
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   how much I'm saving for retirement, I max out a Roth IRA each year, about $6,000 a year.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:50.120]   And then I also have an HSA that I've also been maxing out. And then I do about 8% in
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:38:02.640]   my 401(k) enough to get the employer patch. And then I also have $15,000 emergency fund,
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:08.280]   and then about just $100,000 in relatively conservative investments. And my goal is to
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.800]   get a down payment of $150,000 saved up within the next couple of years as my girlfriend
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:20.840]   and I are on the track towards engagement and marriage within the next couple of years.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.320]   How much of a house do you want to buy?
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:32.040]   Yeah. Just thinking in my area, probably about half a million.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:41.880]   And let me look here. Are there any more details that I need?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:52.840]   Yeah, I think that's about everything number-wise. I guess the question is, do I think about
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.800]   maxing out retirement savings now or saving a little less for retirement and save up more
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.640]   for the house quickly? And then how do I really go about saving effectively in terms of what
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.160]   investments to look at, where to park the money, that sort of thing?
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.440]   Are you stable geographically? Do you think that you might move away from where you are
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.040]   in the future?
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:25.920]   I think we both want to stay in the Georgia area, Atlanta area.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:33.080]   Can you buy a house with a smaller down payment?
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.760]   Probably so. I think that's an area that I need to do some more research, some more looking.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:45.920]   So the question to your answer is not clear-cut. I'm sorry, the answer to your question is
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:53.480]   not clear-cut as I see it. There are good arguments to make on both sides. So let me
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:59.640]   present a few of those arguments to you and then try to draw a couple of conclusions.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:06.760]   The first thing is, I think you have to seriously question, is a house useful to me at this
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:14.860]   point in life? And some people find a great deal of joy and value in being a homeowner.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.840]   Some people don't. So that would be the first thing is, are you the kind of person who sees
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:27.200]   yourself gaining tremendous value in being a homeowner, especially a homeowner of a $500,000
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.720]   house?
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.120]   I understand people who are like that. I know people, they're real homebodies. They love
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.400]   to use their home. They use their home frequently with entertaining. They just enjoy being in
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.480]   there. I think there are some lifestyles where that makes a lot more sense. I don't know
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.720]   if you work at home, if your girlfriend works at home. I observe that a lot of people buy
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:57.120]   houses that they barely use. There are many people, many young couples who own a beautiful
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.320]   home and they go there and sleep and much of the time they're not there. They might
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:08.840]   entertain once a month. They spend their days at jobs, at offices. On the weekends they're
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   frequently out with their friends and sometimes you wonder, is this really worth it? There's
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:21.480]   a big difference. My wife and I married at 26. There is a major difference in the usefulness
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   of a house for us today with four children in our mid-30s compared to at 27. Now when
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:36.840]   we bought a house, I bought a house when we were 27, so right at your age, it felt like
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:45.800]   the last checkmark on that life success chart. I was glad that I bought it, but then when
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.560]   I sold my house, I was glad that I sold it. I can go back and forth. I do continue to
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.880]   believe that houses are often overrated for a lot of people. Not everyone, but overrated
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.760]   for a lot of people. When it comes to buying a house, one of the challenges is you're often
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:09.840]   buying more than you need at this point in time. A young couple, let's say that you marry,
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:15.480]   you have a young couple, late 20s, you only need a house of about three rooms. You need
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:21.280]   a bedroom, a kitchen, and a dining room/living room. But often when you're buying a house,
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.160]   you're buying a house for future ambition. It's just kind of an inefficient approach,
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.880]   right? So you wind up buying a three or four bedroom house and it's an unnecessary expense.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.560]   So there are a lot of good reasons not to buy a house now and just simply to wait. If
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.980]   you go back in the early part of the annals of Radical Personal Finance, I've done multiple
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:45.360]   shows on should I buy a house or should I rent? And in many cases, the raw costs of
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.800]   buying a house are simply higher than the raw costs of renting, if you're willing to
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:59.480]   rent a simpler property. And I'm not at all scared of not owning a house. Now, the flip
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:05.600]   side argument in favor of home ownership is there are many good advantages to owning a
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.560]   home, especially for those who are geographically stable, if you can do it at an early age and
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:19.680]   if you can stay put for a long time. If you could buy a house at 28 or 29 years old that
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.480]   you then were in for the next 30 years, and if you bought a house that was suitable for
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:30.560]   your anticipated family structure, etc. locking that in at today's prices, setting it up on
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.840]   a fixed rate mortgage means that your financial life is abundantly simple. If you have money
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.800]   saved, you have a job, you have a house and you pay off the house over just a normal time
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.680]   period, it's hard not to become wealthy in the United States if you do that. And for
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:54.560]   many people, their own home is one of their best investments. In fact, John T. Reid, the
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:02.680]   real estate author, just wrote a new book called "Why Your Own Personal Residence Is
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.560]   the Best Real Estate Investment You Can Make". I haven't read the book yet, I just ordered
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:14.800]   it, it hasn't arrived yet. But here's a guy who made his career as a real estate investor
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:22.160]   followed by a secondary career as an extremely prolific and well-respected real estate author
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.840]   writing something like almost 20 books on real estate, various aspects of real estate
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:34.360]   investment with piercing clarity. And at the very end of his career, he owned no rental
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:41.680]   properties and he wrote a capstone book basically stating why your own personal residence is
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.160]   your best real estate investment. And I'm familiar with a few of his arguments because
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.820]   I watched him develop the book. I look forward to reading it because I think there are good
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.480]   arguments to say that hey, even if you don't have the perfect house, even if you just have
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:59.520]   it for a few years, owning your own house can be a really productive thing to do financially.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.840]   I could go more but that's enough on the back and forth. So I'm not going to answer that
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.820]   question for you today. What I will tell you is the way that I would negotiate this tension
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.880]   you feel between retirement savings and house savings is simply I would put in place a smaller
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:21.320]   down payment. I see no reason to make large down payments on personal residences. I see
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:28.560]   every reason to pay cash for a house if you want to and if you can. I also see every reason
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:36.440]   to put the smallest down payment possible that allows you to get good financing terms.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.660]   But I see no benefit in putting large down payments in place. And so if I were in your
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:48.740]   shoes and if upon reflection I decided we do want to buy a house, I would put down the
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:58.200]   minimum down payment necessary for us to get good quality financing, modest interest rates,
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:06.460]   etc. across the board. I would very seriously consider simply doing an FHA loan and putting
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:11.880]   down quite literally the minimum using an FHA loan. That will come with some costs that
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.920]   you need to calculate, things like private mortgage insurance, etc. But I think that
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:23.600]   you will retain your flexibility career-wise, life-wise, etc. if you keep most of your money
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:29.720]   in savings and I believe that you should maximize your retirement account contributions versus
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:36.040]   money that goes into the home. And the reason I say that is a few things. Number one, the
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.720]   United States of America has easy credit for homeowners and when people want to throw you
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.400]   hundreds of thousands of dollars at low interest rates and they want to do that secured by
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:52.680]   an asset with pretty good terms, a high degree of safety, I think you take them seriously
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.960]   and you consider taking their money. When you do that, you compound that by putting
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.240]   your money into retirement accounts which saves you money and that money in retirement
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:11.160]   accounts is very, very safe from the protection from creditors. The amount of money you have
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:18.520]   paid down on the house does not affect your rate of return on the property. If you put
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:30.080]   $5,000 down to buy a $500,000 house and that $500,000 house increases in value to $600,000,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.160]   it would not have been a better investment if you put $150,000 down on the same $500,000
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:43.340]   house. And in fact, it's far worse from a numerical perspective. So, most of the arguments
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:49.520]   are put down the minimum down payment on the house and keep your money in another place
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:55.680]   where it can grow and be productive. And this makes a lot of sense for a personal residence
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.560]   where you're not depending on income from a tenant to pay it, etc. So, from an investment
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:08.280]   return standpoint, the argument is on minimal down payment and from a safety perspective,
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   the argument is also on minimal down payment. Let's say that you put down $150,000 and your
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.800]   monthly payment winds up being $3,000 a month on the balance. It would be a little high.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:26.280]   Let's say it's $2,300 a month on the balance. But you have $0 left after you put down $150,000.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:34.460]   Well, in that situation, you wind up with needing to make $3,000 every single month.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:43.940]   But if you put $50,000 down, you keep $100,000 in reserves, and you have now a $3,500 a month
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:54.020]   payment, well, at $100,000 total divided by $3,500, you have 28 months of safety. And
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:49:01.860]   so, I would keep $100,000 in my emergency fund, probably positioned inside retirement
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.980]   accounts, if I can get it in there. I would make my contributions to the retirement accounts
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:11.700]   every year, maximizing those, because every year that passes, you lose the ability to
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:17.220]   contribute to that account. Once this year passes, you will no longer be able to maximize
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:24.100]   those $401k. You can maximize next year's $401k, but these $401k are lost. And so, I
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:30.660]   would maximize retirement accounts and buy the house with the smallest down payment possible,
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.940]   knowing in the future that I can always pay down more, and I can always refinance. But
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:42.980]   that way, I keep maximum flexibility, etc. While keeping in mind that perhaps by purchasing
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.740]   a house, we're less flexible, less able to move for opportunity, more tied down. These
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:53.260]   things can be benefits, but I would consider those downsides to home ownership as well.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:50:02.660]   Yeah, I think that that's a good book recommendation too. I think maybe a good follow-up is I really
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.860]   don't know the first thing about the real estate market. So, what would be some good
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   places to look to begin that education?
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:15.460]   So one of the beauties of that idea, the idea of just simply owning your own house, is you
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:20.460]   don't need a lot of education for the real estate market. And most of the real estate
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:26.940]   market is set up to serve you without education. And so, it's actually quite simple. Now, I
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:32.980]   don't know how aggressive your goals are. I have also been an advocate for simply purchasing
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:39.060]   a series of homes, planning to live in them for a short period of time, and then rent
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:44.980]   them out as rental properties, the so-called Nomad Strategy. I've recommended James Orr's
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:49.360]   book, O-R-R. He has a free book online that he published and a free series of lectures
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.340]   on this. Basically, the idea is you buy a house, plan to live in it for a year, and
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.180]   then after a year, you rent that house out and you go buy another one and you move into
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.340]   that. And you repeat that three, four, five, six times, however many times, and then you
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.860]   quit and you just let your tenants pay down those mortgages for you over time. I'm an
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:09.740]   advocate for that as well. But you'll have to decide if you're willing to wait in and
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:18.140]   go for it. And so, I think the key books that I recommend for people to start with, Read
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:23.420]   the Book is probably a good one. Again, it's on its way to me. He just got them published,
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.100]   printed and he has shipped them out. So, it's on its way to me and I look forward to reading
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:34.380]   it and reflecting on his comments. You can read, I've been an advocate for John Shob's
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:39.620]   book called Building Wealth One House at a Time. Kind of a practical approach to say,
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:45.100]   "Hey, let's buy some rental houses." I've also been an advocate for, as I just mentioned,
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:53.580]   James Orr's book on Nomad Strategy. I think there are some other good books. Brandon at
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:57.380]   Bigger Pockets published a couple of good introductory real estate books. John Reed
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:03.340]   has a good real estate book. I don't have one book for anything. I find that generally
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.660]   I buy five books on a subject, read all five of them or flip through all five of them.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.700]   Then I get a pretty good grasp of what the issues are and then I can narrow in on what
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:15.540]   my questions are and find the book that answers those questions. So, if you are open to that
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:20.620]   approach I think it's really good and I think it's a powerful. If you have a W-2 income
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:27.060]   and your girlfriend has a W-2 income, later your wife, one of the powerful ways to leverage
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.020]   that W-2 income is using the financial markets in the United States. Banks love to lend to
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.620]   people with W-2 income. So, you can buy a house and just buy a house that you're going
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.420]   to live in and then turn it into a rental a year from now. You can also do multifamily,
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:44.140]   right? We buy a fourplex, live in one unit, etc. So, there are many good strategies. Hopefully
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:48.380]   this gives you a taste of some of the options open to you and then if one of those strategies
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.100]   piques your interest then I'd be happy to discuss it further, maybe another call where
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.500]   we talk about it and say, "Hey, let's express this strategy to its maximum and see if it's
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.580]   exciting enough to you to want to go all the way with it."
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:06.260]   Cool. That's a lot of good stuff to chew on. Thank you.
