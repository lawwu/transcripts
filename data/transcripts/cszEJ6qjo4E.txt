[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Well, we all hurt others.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.500]   That's part of what it means to be a sinner.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.300]   And we live with the memories of the ways that we have hurt others.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.900]   And it leads to this really humble and sincere question that comes from a listener named Roy.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.700]   "Dear Pastor John, I have been reflecting recently
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.000]   and was reminded of the hurts I have inflicted upon people whom I have crossed paths with in the past.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.500]   As much as I would like to seek restoration, the means of doing so are no longer practically possible.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000]   While I believe that in Christ those past wrongs are forgiven,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.200]   I can't help but feel a lingering sense of guilt and regret when I bring to mind those incidents.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.000]   How do I reconcile the reality that I have been forgiven in Christ for the hurts that I have caused,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.200]   of which restoration is no longer possible, and my lingering sense of regret?"
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:04.000]   I think the first thing I should say is that probably in this life,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   the things we have done wrong that hurt people in the past will always be remembered.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.100]   If they are remembered, they'll always be remembered with a sense of regret.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700]   It seems to me it would be a sign of callousness
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.100]   if we felt no measure of sorrow for the wrongs we've done and the hurts we've caused.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.500]   So I don't intend to tell Roy that while he lives in this world,
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.800]   he can get beyond those feelings of sorrow and regret.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.500]   Those are signs of a tender heart, not an unforgiven soul.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.000]   The key is this. Will his life be paralyzed by those memories and those feelings of regret,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   or will those very feelings empower him with a sense of greater grace,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.500]   greater gratitude, greater joy at what he has in Jesus who forgives him?
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.000]   That's where the Scriptures do indeed help us tremendously.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.700]   So Roy is right to be moved by the words of Jesus in Matthew 5, 23.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800]   "If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.000]   in other words, if you've really hurt him, "leave your gift at the altar and go,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.100]   and first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   Yes, that's right. Make it right.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.500]   If you've stolen something, give it back and apologize.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.000]   All kinds of things need to be done to make things right,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.200]   and if you're worshiping and brooding and holding a grudge against somebody because of what they did,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.500]   then you need to go make that right.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   So wherever possible, we do this.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.000]   If we've wronged anyone, we should seek to make it right.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.500]   But as Roy is pointing out, that's not always possible.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.300]   The person we wronged may have died.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   They may be utterly inaccessible in some way, in a coma or on the other side of the world.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.800]   They may be unwilling to be reconciled.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.100]   That's the worst kind of inaccessibility.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.000]   Jesus knows all this, and he's not saying that our salvation or even our peace of mind
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.500]   depends on whether we have access to the people we need to be reconciled with
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.600]   or whose hurts we need to set right.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.100]   The thief on the cross had no opportunity to restore anything that he had stolen for decades.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.100]   I mean, he must have stolen from dozens and dozens of people since he is just called a thief.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.200]   And yet Jesus said he's going to be in paradise.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   He never set one thing right, not one.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.000]   Psalm 19 pleads for forgiveness for hidden faults.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.400]   Why? Because we can't remember them.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.600]   We don't even know what people we've hurt.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   And if we can remember some, we can't remember them all.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.900]   So let me give a principle from Scripture that might help Roy,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.600]   and then a closing illustration from my experience.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.900]   2 Corinthians 8, verses 10 to 12 is talking about a heart intention to be generous with our money
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.100]   versus the actual opportunity to do so.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.600]   And then I'm going to apply this to reconciliation, and you'll see the application.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:38.100]   Here's what he says. "A year ago, you started not only to do this, but also to desire to do it, generous giving.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:51.600]   So now finish it as well, so that your readiness in desiring may be matched by your completing it out of what you have."
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   And then Paul says this wonderful word of principle.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   He says, "For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have."
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   In other words, if the readiness, if the willingness, in this case to give generously,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   but it also applies to willingness to be reconciled.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   If the readiness is there for reconciliation and for the repair of wrongs, it is acceptable.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   That readiness is acceptable according to the opportunities we have, not according to what we don't have.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   There's the principle. That's the rescue of us.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   That's what Roy needs to hear.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   In the case of money, if you have it, your willingness will be assessed by your giving.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   But if you don't have it, God knows your willingness, and he delights in it.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   Same thing with reconciliation.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   If there's an opportunity, do it.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   God will delight in that.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   But if there's no opportunity but a great willingness and readiness, God will delight in that.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   Now here's my illustration.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   I got a phone call years ago from a man who had had a heart attack and knew his life was hanging in the balance and that he could die any day.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   And he was calling everybody he could remember that he might have offended and making things right.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   And we had a good laugh together because I like this guy a lot, and we used to spar when I was a teacher in college, and we'd get into hot conversations.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   And he was worried that I was maybe holding a grudge, and I said, "No way.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   I love you. You're fine with me.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   Thanks for calling anyway."
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   So I assured him no ill will.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   But that man's acceptance with God and peace with God did not depend on his getting through his list before he died.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   And I don't know if he got through his list because he did die.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   He did in the next few weeks.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   And it doesn't depend on him remembering everybody that should be on the list.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   For goodness sakes, how could he ever remember that?
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   He was a pretty difficult guy to get along with.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   He probably made a lot of trouble.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   I liked him a lot, though.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   The beauty of his action was that it showed a good heart that wanted to make everything right and to hold no grudges and withhold no reconciliation.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   And that's what God wanted from him.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   That's what God wants from Roy, and that's what God wants from all of usâ€”that kind of ready-to-be-reconciled heart.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   Man, what a story from your own life.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   And, Roy, thanks for the humble and sincere question.

[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   Well, Wednesday, we return to address another doozy of a question.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   When do we unfollow our Christian leaders?
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   When does our loyalty to God override our loyalty to a certain local church?
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Wow, that's a big one.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   I am your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
