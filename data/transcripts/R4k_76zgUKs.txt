[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So today I want to talk about all of the non-urgent, but important stuff that you have to do in your life outside of work, right?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   This is a topic I've been struggling with recently myself.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I've been thinking a lot about it, so I want to bring my thoughts, what I've come up with, to you right now.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I'll start by explaining why these non-professional tasks can be particularly tricky to deal with,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and then I'll describe an approach for dealing with them.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I have four different strategies that I want to recommend, all of which I'm currently experimenting with in my own life.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   The spoiler alert is how you deal with non-professional tasks can look quite different than how you deal with the obligations in your own job.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   All right, let's start by trying to better establish what the problem is here that we're trying to solve.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   When it comes to work, I'm very locked in, right? I'm ambitious, I'm a professor, I'm a writer, and I'm a podcaster.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I do all three of those things at a pretty high level, and I have a rule that all of that work has to happen within normal work hours.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   This requires me to be really on the ball.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So I use, for example, multi-scale planning. I have a plan for the whole semester.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Here's what I'm working on, here's the big initiatives. Then each week I do a weekly plan,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   where I look at that semester plan and say, "Which of these big initiatives am I making progress on?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   When am I going to make progress on them?" I get things into the calendar, I clean up my calendar, I move things around, I cancel things.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I see my weekly schedule like a chessboard on which I'm moving pieces.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And then I have slow productivity principles that act as back pressure. I'm always adjusting my workload, my ratio of execution to overhead.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I try to keep this all pretty much in a line. I'm trying to make a differentiation between what I'm actively working on and non-actively working on.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm taking things off my plate, adding things. I want to make sure that my work is sustainable and I'm not overloading myself.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Now here's the thing. That's a well-planned, busy workday.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So what happens once the workday ends?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Well, first of all, I'm pretty exhausted because I've just executed the sort of productivity equivalent of the D-Day landing.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It feels like that sometimes, trying to make all these things work.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And my time after the workday is over is often already heavily spoken for with family stuff and personal stuff.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I like to exercise most days, that eats up time. I'm schlepping kids all over the place, that eats up time.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We have all sorts of non-professional obligations and events that are on the calendar.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   There's not a lot of time, so I'm tired and there's not a lot of time.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Somehow, all of the various non-professional things needs to fit into these leftover slivers of time.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   This is difficult.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So today I want to discuss some strategies for how to deal with this.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   All right, strategy one, resist the urge to time block your time outside of work.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   During my workday, I give every minute a job.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I survey the time I have available and I want to make the most out of it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Here's what I'm doing for this hour. Here's what I'm doing for these 30 minutes.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   In this gap between these two meetings is what I'm going to handle these small tasks.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   This time is all going to be focused on this big project.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I'm a big believer in professional time blocking.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I think it roughly doubles the amount of stuff you're able to get done with the same fixed amount of time.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   If you have an ambitious professional schedule, it's pretty much necessary,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   or you're going to fall behind and get stressed out.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's also really hard. It's taxing, because you have to keep forcing your mind to say,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   "Here's what we're doing now. Here's the time block we're in. Now let's just focus on execution.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Now here's the time block we're in. Let's focus on that."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You should constantly be on the ball. You're focused. You give your brain very little breaks.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   If you try to do this in your time outside of work, it's too much.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Your brain needs a break from completely structured approaches to time.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   When you time block evenings, when you time block weekends, eventually your brain's going to cry, "Uncle."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It needs flexibility. It needs a time to actually relax.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So resist the urge to time block whatever little time remains outside of your work
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and outside of what's already spoken for.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Strategy two, on the other hand, weekly plan.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So time blocking each of your evenings and weekends is too much.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But you should consider your non-professional tasks when you're working on your weekly plan.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So a couple things matter here.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   One, just reviewing the non-professional things on your calendar each week is useful.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You know what's coming. Oh, on Wednesday, I'm taking the kid to baseball practice,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and then I have like a dinner after that.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   That's literally actually what I'm doing today, and I'm recording this on a Wednesday.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It also allows you to coordinate.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Maybe you and your partner have a relatively intricate dance of who's going to take who
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and how things are going to get dropped off on a particular day.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It gives you a chance to make those plans, to figure out in advance how that's all going to work.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It also gives you time to make changes.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You say, you know what, I agreed to have drinks with a friend on Thursday.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   This is going to blow up that whole day. It makes everything difficult.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Let's move that to another week. You see the whole picture.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So weekly planning matters.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   The other thing to do when weekly planning non-professional events
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   is to get the time-sensitive stuff onto the calendar.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   All right, so this is a chance for you to look at your task list.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Look at the task list you have for your non-professional obligations.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   If you follow my system, you have boards, and you have boards for your non-professional roles,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   divided by status, if there's stuff that's time-sensitive.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   These forms have to get submitted by the end of the week.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   The kids have to get their flu shots this week because the deadline's coming up next week.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   We have to go pick up the title and tags for our new car this week
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   because the temporary license plate is going to expire at the end of the week or something.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   All of these, by the way, are things I'm dealing with right now.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You can get the time-sensitive stuff on your calendar.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So when are we going to do this?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   You schedule out time, and now you'll treat it like any other event or appointment.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Crucially, you can take time away from your workday as needed.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Maybe you have to go out to the car dealership to get your title and tags.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You can look at your calendar and say,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   "You know what? The way I need to do this is take a lunch break on Thursday to go do that."
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It allows you to make sure the time-sensitive stuff gets done.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You know about it. It's on the calendar. It won't be forgotten.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   You can take time away from work where needed.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   So far, so good.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But strategy three is what you should do with the non-urgent
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   but important non-professional tasks that remain.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   This is the thing I've been struggling with recently,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   especially if you own a house or if you've got a family or own cars.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   You can build up a really big list of things that do not have deadlines,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and there's no one looking over your shoulder saying, "This has to be done."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   But they all eventually need to get done.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   If you don't do it in the future, it's going to cause problems,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   or until it is done, it is an increasing source of stress in your life.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   This is where things get difficult with your non-professional work.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So what I actually did here is I just copied—I want to be concrete—
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I copied a bunch of stuff from my actual list
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   that fall under this category of non-urgent but important non-professional work.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I'm going to read some of these.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   We need to repaint the siding on our house.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   We have wooden siding that needs to be repainted.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I don't even know where to start on that.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   There's a section of one of our backyard fences that's broken that needs to be fixed.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Our patio ceiling needs to be washed.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's, like, dirty.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   We have a street-facing fence that's white that needs to be washed.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I don't even really know how to do that. It needs to be done.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I have four or five different bathroom-related repairs.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   There's re-grouting that needs to be done.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   There's multiple towel racks that have been ripped off the wall.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Somehow the drywall has to be replaced,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and something has to be mounted on studs.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   There's a faucet somewhere that needs to be tightened.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Like, it just flops back and forth when you touch it.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   There's a shower in which the thing that you use to turn the water off and on--
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   you can tell Jesse I'm, like, an expert plumber.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The water turn thing is, like, coming very loose.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So I have, like, four or five bathroom-related things.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   The gutters need cleaning after the fall leaves fall.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   My filing cabinets need to be empty. They're too full.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   We've got to pick up the tags for the new car.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That's more time-sensitive, I guess.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   There's three major rooms in our house that need a serious decluttering,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   including my library, which has built up probably about 500 books in piles
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   that have to be severely sorted through.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   The kids' art station has to be severely sorted through.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   The home office's storing boxes needs to be completely cleaned out.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There's a whole list of renovations we want to do here in the Deep Work HQ.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   All queued up. Needs to be done.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I'm working on my home gym, trying to bring in a barbell and squat bench.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   There's a lot of complexities around that.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   The garage itself, where that goes, needs to be cleaned out.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   There's two different unfinished basement spaces
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   that need to be completely decluttered and reorganized.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I need a new primary care doctor. The list goes on.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   None of these things have a deadline.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   All of them need to get done.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   All right, so now we're in kind of a tough situation, right,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   because we have this big list.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   We're not time-blocking our days, our days outside of work.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   We're just putting time-sensitive stuff on the calendar and weekly planning.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   How do we get our arms around these crazy lists
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   of non-urgent but important household items that need to be done?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Now, again, the temptation is to go back and try to time-block them,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and I've tried this before, where I say,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   "I am going to look at my free time, whatever it is,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and I'm going to specifically start scheduling evening time,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   this hour here, this half hour here, this 45 minutes here,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   for specific things on this list."
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It doesn't work. You're too tired.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Your schedule is too much in flux. Things change.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Kids are sick. Things take longer.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Evenings are unpredictable,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   and your mind eventually says, "Enough scheduling."
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Hey, it's Cal. I wanted to interrupt briefly
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   then you need to check out my new book,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   "Slow Productivity, the Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   we talk about here in these videos.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Check it out. Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So what can you do instead?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Well, I want to introduce here the notion
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   of what I call the generic household task.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   This is like a single task,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   which you can define as like work on household stuff.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And the goal is most days to spend some time,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   put aside some time as you're able to,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   on the generic household task.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Some days you only have 20 minutes.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You fit it in like right after dinner.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Other days you have like an hour free.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   You spend an hour on it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But you simplify this huge list.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Like most days I want to do some work
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   on the sort of like household stuff.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And you can keep this tracked in your daily metrics if you want to.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Did I spend any time on the generic household task today or not?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   So you can try to most days you want to do work on it.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Now, what do you actually do
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   during the time you put aside each day on the fly?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Like, let me go spend some time on the household task.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Well, at the beginning of your week,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   you can make a sort of mini prioritized list of like,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   well, I want to start with this
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   at any time I have put aside for the generic household task.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And if I finish that, move on to this.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And if I finish that, move on to this.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's like sort of a mini list of some priorities, right?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So maybe it's like I want to find a fence repair person
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and see if I can set up an appointment.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I want to then work on my file cabinets.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I'm going to order the desk for my office renovation
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and see if I can get the gutter cleaners called.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   This is an ordered list.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So when you first have some time,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   you say I'm just going to work on my generic household task,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   you're working on the first thing in that list.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   If you get done with that,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   next time you're working on the generic household task,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   you move on to the next thing.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   You just, you know, some weeks you'll get farther than others.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   But you've reduced this massive list to a simple heuristic.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I try to spend at least a little bit of time every day
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   on these sort of like non-urgent but important household stuff.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And that's it.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And that's the heuristic.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And that's all the planning that happens.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   You're not exhausting yourself.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You're not over-structuring.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Some days you have no time.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Some days you have a lot of time.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Some days you have a little time,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   but you do like the pressure.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   If I want to do at least a little bit most days,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   you check it off on a list to see.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Here's what I've observed about the generic household task.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   We call it heuristic.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   A lot gets done over time.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   When you're just used to like most days,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I put in some time on these type of things,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and it's clear like what to do if I have time.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Stuff adds up.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   A particular Tuesday might not be that exciting.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   You're like, I only spent 20 minutes on something.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But if you go Tuesday, then Wednesday, then Thursday,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   then Friday, then Saturday, then Sunday,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and you wrap it around another week,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   stuff begins to pile up.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Progress is made on this big list.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And the list will keep growing as you come up with new things.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   The point is the amount of accomplished work gets big.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Now eventually those gutters do get clean,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and the fences do get repaired,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   and there's a day where finally someone comes in
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   and fixes all those things in the bathroom.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And it's like over time progress happens.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It changes your mindset from I have this list I want to finish
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   to I have a process where I always want to be making progress
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   on those type of things.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   We were discussing this.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It came to mind the other day when I was talking
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   to some board members from the school where my kids go,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and they were talking about how with facilities,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   when you run a facility, you just have this ongoing budget.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   You assume stuff breaks on like a regular schedule.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You budget for that in advance.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   You just assume like every year there's like a certain number
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   of things that break in the facilities that you repair.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   It's not seen as we have a steady state,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   and then something breaks when we go and fix it.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's like this is just how you run a facility.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   You have a budget for the AC will break every 10 years,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   like the AV will break on average like every three years.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   So the goal is just to have the process you're constantly
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   like fixing and repairing, not you have some list you want
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   to finish, and then you're done.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   So that has been useful to me,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   the generic household task heuristic,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   very little pressure, very little fatigue,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   very little over-structuring or burnout,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   but you keep on top of things.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   All right, final strategy I want to mention here, automation.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   As you go through these generic household task items,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   anything you get to that happens on a regular basis,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   like you clean the gutters, and you're like, you know what?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   This has to happen twice a year.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It happens predictably, automate it.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And that might mean the easiest sense that you just add
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   a recurring event on your calendar,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and in that event you have all the information you need.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   So when you get the gutter cleaning time again
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   in the next season, this event pops up,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   call this number, set it up, here's how much it costs,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   and it just goes on your, it's like a timed thing
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   on your calendar.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It's not something that you have to have on a task list
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   and get to.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Car washes can go on there.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Cleaning, oh, I have to power wash the patio or whatever.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Wait a second, just when does that happen?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Let me put this on the calendar now,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   so when in the future I don't have to wait for it on a list,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   it's always there.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It takes things off of list and just make them happen
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   when things happen.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So the automation also reduces the pressure here over time.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   More and more things just happen when they need to happen
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   without you having to remember to do them
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   or have them on an intimidating-looking list.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   All right, so that's my advice for non-work tasks.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I'll summarize again.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Resist the urge to time-block everything,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   but do integrate non-work tasks into your weekly planning.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   For the non-urgent but important tasks,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   just have the generic household task heuristic,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   so progress is constantly being made
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   without you having to do a lot of planning
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   and finally automate everything that can be automated
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   as you get to it.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And that, again, is going to relieve your stress
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and get things done with even less consideration.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And so that's what I'm working on now.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   My lists are endless,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   but these type of strategies help me keep on top of them
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   without having to make every moment of my life
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   be overscheduled.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   The household task heuristic.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   That list is getting long, by the way.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Stuff gets done over time is a common theme
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   with a lot of your stuff, work-related and non-work.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's the key to a lot of things.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Stuff gets done over time.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   We had the 10-year rule episode a month or two ago.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Like, important projects in your professional life
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   happen over many years.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   That's when the cool stuff happens.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Household stuff, it's just like
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   you have this background thing going on.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   It's not something that you ever want to be done.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   You just want a process that keeps you on top of it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Yeah, it's a different way of thinking about it
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   as opposed to, like, I have a list of things I'm going to do,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and then when I'm done with those things,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I've accomplished something.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Your list is only going to get longer
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   when you buy your farm to write with your writing shed.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Oh, man, I'm reading a book about a farmer right now.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   That's a lot of work farmers do.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   A lot of equipment repair.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I would be a terrible farmer.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   I would be--they repair a lot of stuff.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Anyways, yeah, when I buy my farm with my writer's shed,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I'm going to have, like, a staff of 30.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   You know how, like, rich people buy these, like, horse farms,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   these, like, show farms where they just--
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Yeah, in Middleburg, Virginia.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Yeah, in Middleburg, Virginia,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   and they have, like, these huge staffs.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   They don't actually have to do anything.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Yeah, I'm going to have a writing farm like that.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   There's going to be this huge staff
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   just to make sure that, like,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I have a good view from my writing cabin.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Enough ink.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Enough ink.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Probably people riding by on horses.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I feel like that would be inspiring.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   When I look out the window,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I just want people riding by on horses.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   In Colonial Garb because--
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Yeah, like a mini Westworld.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I want to build a Westworld
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   to help my concentration for writing,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   and I think this is only reasonable
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   to build an entire fake world
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   full of artificially intelligent cyborgs
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   just to put you into the right mindset for deep work.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I think this is reasonable.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   All right, well, anyways,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   we got some good questions coming up,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   but first, why don't we hear from a sponsor?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   All right, let's hear from our longtime sponsors
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   and friends at Blinkist.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   You've heard me talk about Blinkist forever
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   because I have been a loyal Blinkist user
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   for a long time.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It's an app that gives you
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   over 6,500 book summaries
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and expert-led audio guides
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   you can read or listen to.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   It takes about 15 minutes per title.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   You're getting best-in-class actual knowledge
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   from 27 categories,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   such as productivity, psychology, and more.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   You get it on the go.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's also pretty entertaining.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   The way Jesse and I use Blinkist
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   is as a book triage service.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   If we are interested in a book,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   we add it to our queue,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   and then we will, if we're not sure,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   we'll listen to or read the blink,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   the summary of that book,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and it's really useful for figuring out,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   "Oh, do I want to actually read the whole book or not?"
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Lots of other ways to use it, too.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   You can, like, quickly cover a topic
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   by listening to or reading the blinks
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   of multiple books on a topic.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   That'll give you the lay of the land.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   If you're looking for advice,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   there are audio guides.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Often, you can listen to an audio guide
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   from a how-to book
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   and just, like, get the key ideas
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and get executing right away.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   So it's a great companion to anyone
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   who reads a lot.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   There's a new feature I want to mention
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   called Blinkist Connect.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   With Blinkist, you can now give another person
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   unlimited access for free.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So you will basically be getting
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   two accounts for the price of one.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So I think that's pretty cool.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   just for our audience.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Go to Blinkist.com/deep
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   to start your seven-day free trial,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   and you will get 40% off
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   a Blinkist Premium membership.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   That's Blinkist, spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Blinkist.com/deep
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   to get 40% off in a seven-day free trial,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Blinkist.com/deep.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And now, for a limited time,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   you can even use Blinkist Connect
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   to share your Premium account.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   You will get two Premium subscriptions
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   for the price of one.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   All right, I also want to talk about
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   my friends at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Element is a zero-sugar electrolyte drink
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and sparkling electrolyte water
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   born from the growing body of research
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   occur at sodium levels
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   two to three times
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   to government recommendations.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I like to use the Element
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   drink mix stick packs.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   So you kind of like rip open this powder,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   you add it to any water bottle,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   and it gives you a meaningful dose
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   of electrolytes.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   But the key thing is it's free of sugar,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   it's free of artificial colors
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   or other dodgy ingredients.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   So you don't have to worry about,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   in pursuing hydration,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   adding other junk to your body.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I use Element all the time.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Our ad agency sends me
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   big boxes of this stuff
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   because both my wife and I use it.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   After every workout, I use it.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   In the morning, I use it to get rehydrated.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   After a long day of speaking or podcasting,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I drink it to get rehydrated.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It's got those electrolytes,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   it's got great flavors,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   and you know, no bad stuff.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   If you prefer it even easier,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   you can get the sparkling water
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   with it already mixed in.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Just grab that from the fridge.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   You can also drink it hot.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   They have these limited time flavors
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   like chocolate mint, chocolate chai,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and chocolate raspberry.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   You mix in the hot water.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   If it's cold out or like me right now,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   you want to help your voice,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   great way to get those electrolytes,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   but in a refreshing hot beverage.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   All right, good news.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We have an offer.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   If you go to drinkelement.com/deep,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   you will receive a free Element sample pack
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   with any order.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   You just have to make sure
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   to go to drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Who do we got first?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   - First question is from Jill.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   In your organization system
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   with quarterly goals, weekly plans,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and task boards where you would place
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   projects that arise,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   where do you place projects
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   that arise unexpectedly but are necessary
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and take longer than a week
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   but aren't part of your quarterly goals?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   For example, being tax audited
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   or buying a house.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   - First things first,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   you're mixing up a few things here.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   So you said quarterly goals,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   weekly plans, and task boards.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So there's a couple different things
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   going on here that are getting mixed together.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   There's multi-scale planning,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   which is quarterly or semester plans,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   then weekly plans,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   then daily time block plans.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   That's multi-scale planning.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Then you have task boards.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That's just a tool
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   for keeping track of obligations.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   You would review your task boards,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   for example, when doing your weekly plan.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   All right, so what you're talking about here,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   projects with some time sensitivity,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   like a tax audit or buying a house,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   like you're working on them
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   during a certain time frame,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   those would probably go on my quarterly plan.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Like, hey, one of the things
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   I'm working on this November
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   is house buying.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   We really want to try to hone in
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   on a neighborhood
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and see if we can make an offer.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Or I have a tax audit going on,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   so for the next two months,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I need to be, here's what that means,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and here's what needs to get done,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and here's some milestones.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   That's perfectly fine to be in a quarterly plan
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   or a semester plan, however you do it.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Because then you'll see that each week
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   when you're making your weekly plan
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   to make sure, if important,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   that there's time, if possible,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   put aside to make progress on those goals.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   So that's where I would put it.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I would put it in the quarterly plan.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   They could also show up on your task board, right?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   You could have the next step.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   If it's, you know, another way to deal with it
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   is you could have, like, the next step,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I need to get loan approval
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   or I need to, like, ask the accountant
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   these questions about the information
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I'm gathering.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You could have those in your task board.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Give them their own status list, you know,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   house project, tax project,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   where you can start building up the task.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   If you have a lot of tasks you want to keep track of
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   with accompanying information,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   when you're doing your weekly plan,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   you'll see those columns
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   and sort of make sure time is put aside.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   So that's what I would say for time-sensitive
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   but on kind of large projects.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Mention them in your quarterly or semester plans,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and if they have a lot of non-trivial tasks
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   involved with them, give them special columns
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   in the relevant task board.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   That will help you make progress.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Oh, this name's interesting.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   All right.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Yeah, we got an interesting...
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Argya.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Argya, A-R-G-H-Y-A.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Yeah, Argya, Argya.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   All right, it's not so bad.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   All right, what's the question here?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I'm about to go into my final year of college.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I've been building my career capital
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   by studying programming.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I'll probably work as a software developer.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   How can I implement lifestyle-centric planning
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   if my life has been laid down
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   by my parents, teachers, and professors?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Well, we got to be careful about terminology here.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   What is being laid down by our parents,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   teachers, and professors?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   If it's a particular skill development path, right,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   learning computer programming,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I'm not so worried about that, right?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   you establish your vision of the ideal lifestyle,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and then you work backwards and move closer to that,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   taking advantage of your skills and opportunities
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   and looking for ways around obstacles.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Having learned something like computer programming,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   whether it was your ideas or your parents,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   is just another skill you have in your basket
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   when you're trying to figure out this plan.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   It's another orienteering tool in your backpack
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   as you make this journey across the landscape
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   of possible lifestyles.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   It's great.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   It's something that has some value.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   You can figure out how to use it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   On the other hand,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   if you're getting pressure from your parents
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   about what your lifestyle should look like,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   you need to live in this type of neighborhood.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   You need to have this type of working life.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   You need to be sending your kids to these schools.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   We get a lot of this pressure
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   if you maybe have a parent
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   that comes from a very specific upper-middle-class lifestyle.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   This is our expectation,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   is that you should follow this very specific,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   same upper-middle-class lifestyle,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   which might require pretty narrow paths
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   you have to go through.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   That's where you could get a class
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   with lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   But when it's like,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "Hey, my parents kind of pressured me
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   "to study this in school,"
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   just see that as a skill you have to work with
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   as you construct your own lifestyle-centric plan.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   With programming,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   God, there's any number of ways
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   you can build interesting lifestyles with that.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   In slow productivity, for example,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   I do a nice profile of a web developer designer
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   who was on a track
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   of building a pretty big business around his skill.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   He was living in Vancouver.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   It was very expensive to live there.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   He said, "You know what?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   "I'm going to use this skill
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "to pursue a different lifestyle vision,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "one that is slower, has more nature,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   "tons more autonomy."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   So he moved with his wife
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   outside of the small town of Tolfino
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   on Vancouver Island,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   which is sort of a rural place out there in the Bay.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Tolfino has a surf break.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   His wife was a surfer.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   He did not grow out a big development business,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   but just sort of kept his hourly rate high
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and his expenses low.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   So now he could live in this cool place
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   with a very reasonable amount of work
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   because their expenses were very low.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   As he said, there's not a lot of opportunities
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   where they live to spend money,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   and he used that skill
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   in a really original, innovative way
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   that was specific to the lifestyle plan that he devised.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   His name was Paul Jarvis.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Anyways, that's what I want to say here.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   It's not a big deal because,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   look, if a parent's like,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   "I'm going to help you figure out what to study,"
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   you might have not known what to study,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and it's good to have valuable skills,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   but where you need to have autonomy
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   is in figuring out what the lifestyle is
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   you're moving backwards from,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and so focus on that.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   You know, this is more of a problem, Jesse,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   this, like, parental pressure.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   It's actually more of a problem
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   not for lifestyle-centric planners
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   but for people who subscribe to the passion hypothesis.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Right, so if you--
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   and this comes from my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   If you subscribe to the idea
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   that you're meant to do one thing,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   and if you don't find your true passion,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   you're going to be miserable,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   that's where the parental influence
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   psychologically becomes a real issue
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   because you really worry,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "What if the things they're encouraging me to learn,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   what if the classes of jobs
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   they're encouraging me to pursue
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   are not my one true passion?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I'll be miserable."
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   So the passion hypothesis believers
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   are much more sensitive to pressure
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   than lifestyle-centric planners
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   who just see skills as tools.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Great, these are more tools in my toolbox
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   for building the life I want.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   So I've used three different metaphors here, by the way.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   You put them in your basket,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   use them as orienteering tools
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   that are in your backpack,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   and now it's tool in your toolbox
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   for assembling your ideal life, lifestyle.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   So there you go, guys.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Metaphor, that's how you know I'm a writer.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Next question's from Ben.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   "I want to start building career capital,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   but I'm not sure what rare and valuable skills to pursue.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I'm worried about investing years developing a skill
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and having it turn out to be not as lucrative
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   or align with my lifestyle vision as I hoped."
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Yeah, this is partially a hard question
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   and partially an easy question.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So the hard thing about finding skills
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   is it can sometimes be difficult
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   to even identify what's valuable.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   In some fields, this is obvious.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   In other fields, it really takes work, right?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Like, let's say you get involved in political campaigns.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   You get started as, like, an intern in college.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You get a position on a campaign.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You're trying to figure out this world of politics.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   It might not be obvious at first.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   What are the things I could master
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   that would make me invaluable
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   in this world of political campaigning?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And to figure that out,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   you actually have to talk to people and observe, right?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Who's getting ahead?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Who's in demand?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Who's influential?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Why?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   What are the particular skills
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   that they have that's in demand?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So, right, so it can be tricky sometimes
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   to figure out what actually matters.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   On the other hand, it's not too difficult
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   to sidestep the trap of a dead-end skill.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Just bias towards skills that, in a general sense,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   have a long track record
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and, in a specific sense, are very adaptable.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Right, so computer programming.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   In a general sense, computer programming has been
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and will continue to be valuable
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   because we program computers
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   to do lots of things in our lives.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   In the specific or small-scale sense,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   you might have to adapt along the way
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   what language you're using.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   But that's okay.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   If you're good at computer programming,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   you can change to a different language
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   when it emerges pretty quickly,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   so that's a pretty safe skill.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Dead-end skills are skills that are tied
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   to a particular cultural trend,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   business moment, or technological device.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   They're tied to that,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and if that goes away,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   they have no other value.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   For example, I would be very wary right now
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   if you said what I'm going to specialize in
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   is TikTok videos
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   for certain types of marketing.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   You're going to get really good at what works
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and doesn't work on TikTok
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   and how to build videos
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   for my political candidates or for brands
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   that are going to do well on TikTok.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   What happens if TikTok's banned in the U.S.?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Or, more likely, just another tool rises
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and there's like, "Guys, that one goes away."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   That skill is hyper-specific.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And now, you know, you tied your horse
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   to a wagon that looked attractive in the moment,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   but the wheels are going to come off pretty soon.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So you do want to be careful.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   There's probably a lot of people out there
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   that, like, specialized in Vines
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   or, you know, hey, Instagram Stories is my thing.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   I know exactly what works on Instagram Stories.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   The problem is once people stop using that,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   you have to start from scratch from skills.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   So look for the summarize here.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Do the work to figure out
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   what actually matters in your field.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It might not be what you think.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   It might be non-obvious.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Two, bias towards skills that are,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   in a general sense, have a long track record,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   are going to be around for a while,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   even if it requires that you adapt
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   exactly how you're applying that skill in the short term.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And three, be wary of more fattest skills,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   skills that are tied to a trend or technology
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   that if that goes away, the skill itself is dead.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   You do those things, I think you'll be okay.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   All right, who we got?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Next question is from Margaret.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   "I'm a mother of three and a writer.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   "I had success with my first book
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   "but needed to quit social media to write my second.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   "It's set to be published next year.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   "Should I go back on social media for promotion
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   "now that it's finished?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "I don't think my presence on social media
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   "moves the needle at all in terms of sales,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   "but it can be important for connections
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   "and driving attendance at events
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "that occur with publication."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Well, look, you're right.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   In the long term, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   It doesn't move the needle on sales
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   in any sort of meaningful way.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   It's not going to be what stands between you
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   having a successful career as a writer or not,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   and I'm completely fine with you not using social media.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   If you feel like for the relationship
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   with your publisher,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   you need to be doing something new media,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I think that's completely fine.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   If you don't really care about it,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   you can set these things up in a way
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   that has very limited impact on your life.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   So what I've seen fiction writers do,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and I think this is a perfectly fine template,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   their ultimate goal is to get people onto an email list,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   an email list where they can send updates
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   about events, what's going on with their books.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Email lists convert very highly
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   when it comes to book sales,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   much more so than almost any other type
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   of metric of online following that you can have.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   So they have an emailing list.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Now, how do you get people onto that mailing list?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Have some sort of regular content
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   that's low lift but interesting,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and it really could be like updates
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   on your writing or your writing progress.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It could be here's the books I read this month.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   This is a good one.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   I'm just going to go through what I read this month.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   You only have to write this once a month,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   and here's the books I read and a quick summary of them.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   People love book recommendations,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   especially if you're in the fiction world.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   So you have some value on there,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   but it's a very low lift.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Then you can have some sort of algorithmic presence
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   to try to drive people to it.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So by algorithmic presence,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   I mean somewhere where you are out there
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   in the world of new media
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and recommendation algorithms
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   could drive audiences to you
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   that you otherwise wouldn't have direct access to.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   The key here is whatever you pick to automate it
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and not spend much time on it.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   So maybe it's an Instagram thing.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   If it's an Instagram thing, though,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   again, I don't want you on Instagram.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I don't want you looking at Instagram posts.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I don't want you reading comments on Instagram.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   It's I post a quote.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I post a book I like.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I post a writing update.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Maybe I even have someone do it for me.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   It's not on my phone.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's done from my desktop.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's a schedule,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   as much of a schedule as watering my plants,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and I think about it
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   when I'm not outside of those moments.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I think about it just about as much
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   as I think about watering my plants
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   when I'm not watering it.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   It's just not a big part of my life,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   but I do it, and the plants stay alive.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   So maybe you're doing Instagram.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Maybe you're doing TikTok,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   though that can be pretty difficult.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Maybe you're doing YouTube.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Brandon Sanderson,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   if you're not familiar with Brandon Sanderson,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   he wrote "Name of the Wind,"
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   and if you have any comments about that,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   you can send them to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   He loves to see them.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I should clarify.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Every time I make this joke,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   a new listener gets really upset.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   We know Brandon Sanderson
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   did not write "Name of the Wind."
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   This is an insider joke on the show, okay?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   The Patrick Rufius fans can--
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   it's okay.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   We can chill.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Brandon has really,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   really leaned into YouTube,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   and one of the things he does
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   is have these writer's updates on YouTube
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   where he's like,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   "Here's how many pages I wrote this week.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   "Here's what's going on with this project.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   "Here's what's going on with that project."
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   People love that,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and that's a way for audiences
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   to potentially find them.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   So sure, have an algorithmic presence
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   if you care about this.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Again, I don't think it--
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   it doesn't make a matter of--
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   long-term, it doesn't matter.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   What matters is the book rate,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   but I get it.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   In the short term,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   you want your publisher happy.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   It's anxiety-reducing,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and you want people
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   to show up to your book signings.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I get it.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   So have something
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   that is in the algorithmic media world
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   that you post to intentionally
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   and on a regular basis,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   but otherwise completely ignore the technology,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and always be driving towards a mailing list
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   where you have some sort of value on it.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I think that's probably
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   the sweet spot right now for writers.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   So you're taking your intentional swing
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   in algorithmic space
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   but not letting it be a part of your life,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   and then you have a mailing list.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It'll probably do nothing,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   but that setup's not going to hurt you.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   If something catches on, though,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   it does give you the chance
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   of riding that wave
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   or taking advantage of it.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   But again, with books,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   what matters is the book being great.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Ultimately, that matters.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Most of the writers
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   who are killing it right now,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   no one cares about their online presence.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   No one cares about
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Kristen Hanna's Twitter account.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Her books sell because they get passed around.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   "Hey, I love the women.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   You should read this novel."
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "Lessons in Chemistry"
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   sold all the copies in the world,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   not because of TikTok,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   but because people started passing it around.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   "You've got to read this book at book groups."
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   "Deep Work" sold a ton of copies,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   not because of my blog.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   People just, "Hey, I like this book.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You should read this book."
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   So ultimately, it doesn't matter,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   but that's what I would recommend
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   if you're an author
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   and you want to be doing something.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   That's probably, right now,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I think, the sweet spot.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Don't podcast, by the way,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   unless you really want to do podcasting
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   as a business.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Podcasting is very hard.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   It takes up time and money,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   and it's not worth it
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   unless you're making a real run
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and having a real business.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   So don't do that
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   unless it's actually a part
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   of your business plan.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   That's not casual.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Sound quality is big, too.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Sound quality is big.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   YouTube, you have to be careful about.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   YouTube is hard.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Justin and I have learned this.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You can't just record yourself
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and put it up there
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and say people will find it.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   It's pretty difficult.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Thumbnails, titles,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   exactly how you cut into these videos.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   So you have to be super specific
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   and intentional,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   and the stuff you think
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   that will do well probably won't.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   But it's not a bad idea
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   if you find something that clicks,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   a format that works,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   like Brandon Sanderson's
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Here's How Much I Wrote This Week.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Like if you find a format that works,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   it could be good.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   So that's my recommendation.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   So Brandon does it from the layer?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   He does it from the layer, yeah.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   So he does.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   We should bring it up.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Can I bring it up on here?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I'm actually curious.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Let's look.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   I still want to get out there
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and see the layer.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Justin and I got an invite,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   but we just have not been able
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   to make that work.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   All right, so what I'm going to do,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   should I go to the YouTube app
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   or the web?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Go to the web.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   All right.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   So I'm loading up here.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   YouTube.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Let me--
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   don't switch to it yet.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   All of Jesse's video recommendations
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   are about popery arrangements.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Interesting.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I didn't realize.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Let me type in Brandon Sanderson.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   All right.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Yeah, all right.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   So here's his channel.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I have it on the screen now.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   It's not huge.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   600,000 subscribers.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   It's like double our channel.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   But he's sold a lot of books.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Let me look at his videos chronologically.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   All right, so what's he up to?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Weekly update, 50,000 views.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Last week's 58,000 views.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Weeks before, 65,000 views.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   So that's like his very consistent thing.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   He has a base of like 50,000 to 60,000 people
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   who watch the weekly updates.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Let me put one up here.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   This is in his layer.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   So I'm sure it's filmed.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Yeah, so he has a very nice setup with a bookshelf
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   and professional writing.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I don't know why YouTube--
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   I guess it defaults to closed captions now
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   for international audiences.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   All right, so here we go.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   See that?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   See on the screen, that graphic?
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   That's like what percent of the book he's done with.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   So this is his most popular thing he does.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   He's tried other things.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So he has this podcast, "Intentionally Blank."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   These do half the traffic.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   So this is like him talking with a co-host.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   They do like half the traffic.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   And then-- so that's more for him.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   I think the weekly updates keeps his fans engaged.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   I don't know that the video podcast--
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   this is more-- it's just him with someone else.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And they chat about things, but it's not nearly as popular.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And then he does one-off things on here as well,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   like a fan event.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Like, let me put up a video of me doing a fan event, et cetera.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   And those don't do as well either.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   So anyways, I think it's kind of cool, right?
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Like, he has a very specific strategy.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   He does these weekly updates.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   That's his relationship with his fans.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   That's what-- you know, he got this set up once.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   But notice, these aren't huge views.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   For someone that famous with 600,000 subscribers,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   you know, all of that work,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   it's still going to be like a core group of people.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   So there's an example.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   All right.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Let's-- what do we got next?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   We have our slow productivity corner.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Oh, excellent.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Let's hear some theme music.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   For those who are new, we like to have
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   one question each week that relates
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   to my most recent book, "Slow Productivity--
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   If you have not read or listened to this book yet,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   you should.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I estimate about half of what we talk about on the show
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   actually references ideas from that book.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   So it's sort of like the source guide
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   to the "Deep Questions" podcast.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   All right, Jesse, what's today's slow productivity question?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   It's from Rachel.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   How can I do fewer things if I'm expected to bill
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   40 client hours every week?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Well, I think this is one of the more common questions
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   I hear about the philosophy of slow productivity.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   There's three principles to this philosophy
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   that I outline in the book--
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   do fewer things, see what the question's about,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   work at a natural pace, and obsess over quality.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   The concern people have about do fewer things
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   tends to be based on a misunderstanding
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   of what's being proposed.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   They read do fewer things as work fewer hours
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   or accomplish fewer things.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   That's not actually what it means.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   I think we've become used to, over the last five years,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   we've become used to a sort of anti-work rhetoric
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   that really focuses on an antagonistic relationship
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   with work and, therefore, to repair our existing issues
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   with burnout, we need to reduce the amount of work we're doing.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   So there's a--it homogenizes all work as work,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and what it measures is how much you're doing.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And it says, look, there's these pressures,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   be them capitalistic or cultural,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   that's pushing you to do too much,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   and you need to do less.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   This would be at the core of books
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   with do nothing in the title
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   or the quiet quitting movement, et cetera.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Slow productivity is coming at this from another angle.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   When it says do fewer things,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   what it really means is do fewer things at once.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And it's actually a very practical argument.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Everything you agree to do has two components with it.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   There's the actual execution of the work itself,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   and there's the administrative overhead
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   that comes along with collaborating with other people
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   and gathering the information you need to do the work.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   The amount of administrative overhead per task is fixed.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   So as you say yes to more and more things,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   the total amount of administrative overhead
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   in your calendar goes up.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   But administrative overhead is highly distractive
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and highly inflexible,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   because it's not just you deciding to do it.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   You've got to send a message.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You've got to wait for a response.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   You've got to get on a call.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   You've got to go into a meeting.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   So as you have more and more administrative overhead,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   more and more of your day is spent
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   servicing the administrative overhead.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   It leaves you less time to actually execute the work.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Quality of your life goes down, exhaustion goes up,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   and the rate at which you finish things goes down as well.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   So do fewer things means do fewer things at once.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   It has nothing to do with the total hours of work that you do.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   And if anything, it'll increase what you accomplish.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   So in the context of billing hours, it would mean, look,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   work on less clients at a time,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   but you'll be able to give each of those clients
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   more consecutive time.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   And we'll probably finish or get the major milestones
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   with these clients faster and a higher level of quality.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   I would build this against the same backdrop
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   if I bill 40 hours.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   It's like, what are you doing with your 40 hours?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   What's the ratio of deep work execution
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   versus administrative overhead in those 40 hours?
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   As you make the former larger, your work
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   will be of a higher quality, and it will also
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   become more sustainable.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   All right, so that is our Slow Productivity Corner
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   question of the week.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Let's hear that theme music one more time.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   All right, do we have a call this week, Jessie?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   We do.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   All right, let's hear it.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Hi, Cal.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   My name is Anna, and I work in campus ministry
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   at a college campus.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   My deep work ministry is definitely
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   focusing on the relationships and events that we have.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   So I love your idea of simulating my own support staff
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   to sort of get the administrative tasks done
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   so I can focus on what's most important.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   I have a student worker that I use
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   to take care of some of the administrative recurring tasks
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   and one-off tasks, but I actually
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   do get to hire a new administrative assistant.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   So I'm wondering if you have any advice on how
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   to integrate them into a Newportian kind of system
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   without having to spend a ton of time creating tasks for them.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Cool.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Thank you.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Well, that's great.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   The fact that you get a hired administrative assistant,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I think is great.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   The fact that you have autonomy over what this assistant's
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   going to do is also great.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   So how do we get a Newportian set up here?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Well, I have a couple of notes here.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   First, I want to just start by underscoring something
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   you mentioned in passing, this idea of treating admin work
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   like a different job.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Let me just briefly elaborate that for listeners
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   who are unfamiliar.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I'm a big believer if you have a sort of autonomous role
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   like this that has some major deep work requirements,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   but also some major administrative requirements,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   is to treat those two roles as two part-time jobs.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   I have my admin job, where I am in charge
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   of the logistics and budget of running a particular campus
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   ministry, and I have my minister job,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   where I'm forming connections, I'm thinking big thoughts,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I'm writing, I'm on stage or in the room with other students
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   and helping them feel secure in their spiritual community.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Treat it as different part-time jobs that
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   have different schedules.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   This is when my administrative job, this is when I do it.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   My deep work pastoral job, this is when I do that.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And so you're not mixing the two together.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   You're still giving the same amount of time to each
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   that you would if you were doing them in a more haphazard style,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   but you're not mixing them together.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   So when you're doing admin work, and maybe that's
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   what the afternoons are like, or the first hour of the day
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   and from 3 to 5 is like, that's all you're doing.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And in the other hours, all you're doing
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   is your office is open, students are coming in,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   you're writing, you're thinking, you're inspiring.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   You're not context-shifting constantly back and forth
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   between these two worlds.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   It's a good way of handling what's increasingly
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   common in non-entry-level positions in the knowledge
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   economy, which are these multi-role jobs.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Treat the role separately.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   All right.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Your administrative assistant, it
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   will be helpful if you keep this in mind, right?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   What you want to avoid is the administrative assistant
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   having a hive mind style collaboration relationship
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   with you, where you're just constantly going back and forth
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   about things.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Hey, what about this?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I'm working on this.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   What about this?
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   You do not want to sort of meld your minds into a hive mind,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   because that assistant then is not
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   going to save you from context shifts and distraction,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   but will actually amplify them.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Because when it's just you, at least you
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   have some control over, I'm writing now,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   so I'm not going to work on getting the catering order
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   right for this event staff.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   But when there's someone else involved, they don't know that.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   They're working on the catering order.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   They're going to come interrupt you right then.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   So it can actually be worse if you don't do this right.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   So what does work is processes.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   You have to do the hard work of figuring out,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   what are the regular things that we do?
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   What are our systems and processes for dealing with them?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And then the admin can be plugged
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   into that existing system.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   The admins can't come up with the systems and processes,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   because you know the role, and you know what's important.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   So for example, let's be specific.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   I'm guessing here, but maybe one of the things you have to do
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   is meet with students.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Students will come to you and say, whatever,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   I just want to talk to someone on campus
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   from my spiritual background.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   And these are-- you don't know when students
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   are going to make these requests, and it's
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   a big, important part of your job.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Have a scheduling process that you can then plug
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   an admin assistant into.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Oh, you want to set up a chat with me?
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Send a note to the admin, right?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   The admin then knows.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   We've set aside specific times for student meetings,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   maybe, that he or she can schedule them directly into.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Or maybe we have, on Mondays, you sit down with the admin,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   you have a list of students who want to meet with you,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   and you figure out where you want
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   to put those meetings in the week,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   and then they go back and tell the students, right?
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Maybe when the student writes in, the rule is the admin says,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   OK, what is your class schedule next week?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   What are generally the times you're available?
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   We'll get back to you with meeting times
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   on Monday morning, right?
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Whatever it is, have a system that you're then
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   plugging the admin into.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   The other thing you want to do, in addition
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   to processing systems, is have a communication protocol.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   All of these ideas, by the way, are in my book,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   A World Without Email, if you want to look deeper into this.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   But have a communication protocol,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   so that the default does not become,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   as the admin thinks of something or needs feedback,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   they just ping you and need an answer quickly,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   so they don't have to keep track of it.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Real-time but regular is the right way
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   to do it with an admin.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   At some point in the morning, you should check in on the day,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   see what's going on, what's open.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Sometime in the afternoon, you should do the same.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   In between those times, they can consolidate everything
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   that they need to talk to with you.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   So I think frequent but pre-scheduled real-time
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   conversation is the right way to actually communicate
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   with an admin.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   It's very nuanced.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Things get done, but it involves--
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   it prevents, rather, unscheduled distractions
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   and interruptions.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   And make sure that everything you have the admin doing,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   that you have some sort of well-defined processing
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   system that surrounds it.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Write these things down.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Right?
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   You do those things, and admin can be very effective.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   If you don't, it can actually make things worse.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   If it's just, I'm just going to be-- we'll just
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   be talking throughout the day.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   I'll give you work.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   You'll check in with me with what questions
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   you have about that.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   You're going to find the admin is actually adding more work
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   than they're saving.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   So it's a good question.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   You're in a good situation if you handle it carefully.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   And I think, based on your call, I think you probably will.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Yeah, admins are interesting, Jesse.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   I always think of Joe Rogan's advice,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   which we talk about on the show a lot,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   which was, at least in Hollywood entertainment,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   if you need an assistant, do less things.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   So that's where I start.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   If you need an assistant, you're doing too much.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   But in some roles--
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   no, no, the role is really well-defined,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   like being in campus ministry.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   There, a well-deployed assistant can really
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   make your life easier.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   There should be more support staff in general, I think.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And like most jobs.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   It's crazy the way we do this.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   They have so many roles on individuals.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   We think that this is somehow more economically efficient,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   but it's not.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   A campus minister that also has to be the administrator
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   of a complex campus ministry is very bad.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It doesn't do as much ministering.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   An executive that has to spend all this time emailing
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   back and forth with HR and booking flights
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   or this or that, it's just way worse at being an executive.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   We don't always think about that.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   All right.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   It looks like we have a case study.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   So what we try to do is people send in
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   There are stories of using the type of advice
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   we talk about on this show in their own life.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   So we can see what it looks like in practice.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Today, we have a case study from Hannah.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   Hannah says, I'm a software developer.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   In software development, we have this process
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   called pull request review.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   When your work is put in a pull request,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   and it must be approved by one of your peers
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   before it can be considered done and merged into the code base.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   All right.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   This is a technical thing, but programmers know about it.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   This is me talking now.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Just think about pull requests as you basically saying,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I changed some code from this complicated system
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   that I want to now add back to the system.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   And a pull request says someone is going to check it
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   before it gets added back in.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   So it ensures that someone doesn't mess up
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   something about the system.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   All right.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   I joined the team as a more junior developer.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   And I used to feel like a big part of my job
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   is to immediately check the pull request from the senior
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   developers.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   And if there's no serious bug, I should
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   give a quick stamp of approval so their work
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   can move on and be merged.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   I was partly too nice and scared of blocking the process
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   and partly chose to be visibly busy.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   By participating in the pull request review
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   as soon as the notification came in,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   I felt like people can see me working,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   stepping away again.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   This is a classic example of what I call in my book
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   slow productivity, pseudo productivity,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   which is the use of visible activity
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   as a proxy for useful effort.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   All right.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Back to the case study.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   This approach, however, requires constant context switching
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   and turns me into a zombie, checking Slack and emails
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   all the time, hunting for visible work.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   After reading Deep Work, I decided this has to change.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   I started with time block recording
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   just to have an account of how my time was spent
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   and was appalled to find out how much went into checking
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Slack and getting distracted.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   After seeing this pattern for one week,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   I started to actually do daily time block planning.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   In addition, I also plan for the coming week
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and retrospectively review the previous week
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   to understand myself better.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   I now try to start the day with at least an hour
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   block of coding work without opening Slack or emails,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   which is a game changer when it comes to setting
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   the mood for the day.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Then I schedule all pull request reviews for 10 a.m.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   after the team's daily meeting and again at 3 p.m.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   after my afternoon walk.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Each review time block lasts at most one hour,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   usually less than I move on with my own tasks.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   I thought my coworkers would notice and be mad,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   but it seems like waiting a few hours for review
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   doesn't bother them at all in most cases.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   With this new system,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   I've become more effective and happier with my own work.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   My deep to shallow work ratio went from 20% to 40%.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   I was able to complete a complicated project
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   and got a lot of positive feedback from the team.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   When the project is done,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   I feel I've earned more trust from others
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   and a lot more confidence in myself to keep optimizing
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   my schedule to fit my vision,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   like skipping irrelevant meetings to get more deep work done.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   As a classic example of the type of principles
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   we talk about here on the show in action,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   pseudoproductivity convinces us.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   We talk about this all the time on the show.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   It convinces us that there's these committee meetings
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   where our peers and bosses are studying our every response.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   They have bar charts of the average latency
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   between pull requests and completions
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   and they're looking for anything different
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   and as soon as they see a change,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   hmm, I've noticed that,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   see this was from Hannah.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Hannah seems to be waiting until 10 a.m.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   to handle their pull request.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   This won't stand at all
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   and they're getting really upset about this.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   People don't care, they're busy.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   They finish something, they move on to something else.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   What they notice is if you're negligent,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   if you skipped a pull request,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   if you would often have a day or two go by,
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   that would flag negatively and people would notice,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   but the fact that you've batched these at 10 and 3,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   no one cares, they get done, right?
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   But you've made your life more easier.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   The other thing that happens as we see in this case study
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   is that as you move away from pseudo productivity,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   you begin to obsess over quality,
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   one of the principles of slow productivity.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   I like doing deep work.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   I like producing stuff that matters.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   I get good feedback when I do stuff that matters.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Suddenly, pseudo productivity
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   and all the performance of busyness seems less appealing.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   The more you care about quality,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   the more likely, as we see in this case study,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   you are to say, "I'm not going to that meeting,"
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   or, "I'm not going to even look at my Slack until 10 a.m."
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   because you get addicted to the rewards
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   and positive feeling of doing good work.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   That's why obsess over quality, I say,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   is the glue for the slow productivity philosophy.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   If you don't do that part,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   everything else becomes just like
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   an antagonistic relationship with your work.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   If you don't obsess over quality,
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   but you're still trying to reduce the number of things
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   you work on concurrently and work at a more natural pace,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   it's just like, "I don't like work.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   I want to do less of it.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   I want to be less hard."
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   When you obsess over quality, you start doing those things
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   because it lets you do better work.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   When you obsess over quality,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   you gain more freedom to do those things
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   because you're doing better work.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   I see this as a great case study
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   of what happens when you leave pseudo productivity
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   and you embrace the type of ideas I talk about
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   in slow productivity.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   All right, we have a final segment coming up,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   a tech corner.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Talk about a trend in the world of technology
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   that is critical,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   but you are not paying enough attention to.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   First, however, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I want to talk about Notion.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Notion combines your notes, docs, and projects
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   into one space that's simple and beautifully designed.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   And now with the new Notion AI,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   you have the capabilities of multiple AI tools
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   built in to the Notion workspace
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   you already know and love.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   This means you can search, generate, analyze,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   and chat all within Notion.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   Now, I've talked about Notion before
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   because I think it's a fantastic tool
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   if you want to build custom systems
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   around the information that matters to you
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   and your business.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   We used to have, for example, an ad tracking system
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   that was built on Notion
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   that made it really easy for us
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   to get to the various information
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   relevant to the ads we do here on this show.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   So, like, you could see a calendar view, for example,
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   of each of the ad reads coming up on upcoming recordings.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   You could click on one of those ads
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   and see all of the upcoming ad reads
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   for just that advertiser.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   You could jump on a particular ad read
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   for a particular day from that advertiser,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   get the script and enter the information
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   about the timestamps, et cetera.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   It was a great custom tool
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   that allowed us to get at all the information
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   surrounding ads, in this case,
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   in very useful, intuitive, and efficient interfaces.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   So, I love Notion,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   but Notion AI makes this all even better
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   because it integrates AI into the tool.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   You can, for example, now search across Notion
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   and other apps.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   It can generate docs for you in your own style.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   It can analyze PDFs and images.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   You can chat with it about anything.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Notion AI is connected to multiple knowledge sources.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   It uses AI knowledge from GPT-4 and Cloud
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   to chat with you about any topic.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   It can search across thousands of Notion docs
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   in seconds to quickly answer any question.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   These are questions about your own information.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Hey, when was the last time we did
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   an ad read for Notion or something?
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   It's over here.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   What are the main points from the script
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   for this ad read that we did?
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   Whatever, it goes, finds it, your information,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   gives you the information back.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Conversational database, fantastic technology.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   Unlike other specialized tools or legacy suites
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   that have you bouncing between six different apps,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Notion is seamlessly integrated,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   infinitely flexible, and beautifully easy to use,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   so you're empowered to do your most meaningful work.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Also, Notion is really big on privacy.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Notion's AI partners are contractually prohibited
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   from using your data to train their AI models.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Notion AI respects the permissions of your content,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   so it will only reference content that you have access to.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   So try Notion for free when you go to Notion.com/cal.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Type that in all lowercase letters, Notion.com/cal,

[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Notion.com/cal.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   I also want to talk about our friends at Z Biotics.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Jesse and I are old men.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Let's be honest.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   We're in our 40s now.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   It's not like we were when we were in college.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   What that means is, like, if we're going out with some friends,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   like, tonight I'm having dinner with three friends.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   We'll probably have, like, a drink or two,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   because it's a nice dinner.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   That could be enough for us old men.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   They'll, like, knock us out the next day.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   They get us off to a more sluggish start.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   This is not the way it was in college.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   My memory of Dartmouth -- and maybe I have this little wrong, Jesse.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   My memory of Dartmouth is that Natty Light came out of the water fountains.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   I think it was just, like, part of our student fees went to --
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   you could just, like, the spigots, right?
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   It's not the case when we're 40 anymore.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Okay, so enter in Z-Biotics, which is a pre-alcohol, pre-biotic drink.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   It's the world's first genetically engineered probiotic.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   It was invented by a PhD scientist to tackle rough mornings after drinking.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Here's how it works.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   It's this byproduct, not dehydration, that's to blame for your rough next day.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   So pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Remember to take Z-Biotics.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Make that your first drink of the night.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Drink responsibly, and you'll feel your best tomorrow, right?
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   So it's something you actually take before you go out and meet your friends,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   and then those couple drinks you have won't feel quite so bad the next morning.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   Kind of a cool idea, especially for those of us who aren't that young anymore.

[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do our final segment.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   I want to do something, and maybe we should get—
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   eventually I think we need theme music for this, Jesse,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   but I want to add something I call "tech corner" occasionally to the end of the episode.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Look, I'm a technologist. I'm a computer scientist.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   I'm a founding faculty member of Georgetown Center for Digital Ethics.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   I'm the director of the Computer Science, Ethics, and Society academic program at Georgetown.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   I think a lot about technology and its impact.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Everything on the show is vaguely about that, right?
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   The deep life is something that we're often establishing as a bulwark against a distracted life,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   where those distractions come from the electronic world,
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   but sometimes I want to get geeky about specific technologies.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   Today I want to briefly talk about advances in a trend
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   that I think is one of the most important trends in technology that most people are ignoring,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   and it has nothing to do with AI.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   All right, I'm putting a video on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   What you're going to see here is a video from a company called Immersed.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   You see a man holding up what looks like a smaller version of Apple Vision Pro.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   It kind of looks like ski goggles. These are important.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   All right, here's someone wearing them.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   All right, so Jesse, what do you think about these goggles?
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   These still aren't casual. You would notice if someone was wearing these.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Right.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   But they're like small ski goggles with a cable coming off of them.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   All right, so what do these do?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   I'm going to zoom ahead here to them in progress.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   All right, we see on the screen what the person wearing the visor sees,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   which is their computer screens, but floating in space against a sort of scenic background.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   You can also use these with pass-through, pass-through to that,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   where you see your actual space around you, but with these computer screens floating.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Here's what's important about this particular product.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   It's called Visor. It's from a company called Immersed,
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   a company that I actually profiled in The New Yorker back in 2021.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   It's about a third the price of Apple Vision Pro, right?
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   Why is it about a third the price?
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   They have specialized in one particular use case,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   which is when I put on these augmented reality goggles,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   the only thing I want to do is have virtual computer monitors.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   I want to take the screens from my computer I'm using right here,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   make them bigger, and put them in virtual space.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   If that's all you're doing,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   it simplifies a lot of the hard problems about augmented reality.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   When you don't need the whale to come out of the floor of the gymnasium
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   like we see in the famous Magic Leap demo,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   when you don't need the ability to be walking through a building
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   and have a Jar Jar Binks character walking alongside of you,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   when you don't need the ability to walk 360
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   around a carefully rendered 3D Minecraft map
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   that's getting the lighting right from all directions,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   when you don't need any of that,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   all you need is I want screens floating in space,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   and they stay fixed in one space.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   In fact, my laptop will be there in the scene,
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   so I can anchor them to where my laptop is.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   The challenge of augmented reality gets much easier,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   so the price can go way down.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   The reason why I think this is important
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   is because the particular use case that Immerse is focusing on with the Visor
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   is the killer app.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   It is the thing we should be paying attention to, virtual monitors.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   This is the big change. I've talked about this before,
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   but now we're making progress for it.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   This is the big change that is coming.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   I do not need a TV. I do not need to buy a desktop.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   I don't need to have multiple laptop computers.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   The screens will be virtual.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   When you think about this, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   What I bring with me is a pair of glasses.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   When I put on those glasses, I get a big monitor computer screen,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   or I get four computer screens, or I get a TV on my wall,
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   whatever wall I happen to be in, and I can watch a movie there.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I can watch a TV show there.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   This makes so much more sense when we think about it
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   than having to have all of these pieces of glass
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   on top of OLED light-emitting diodes
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   that we hang and put on hinges and put in all of our spaces
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   and that we use to sort of see things.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   Why not just make all these screens virtual?
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   Then I don't have to buy all these different things.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   I need one powerful computing device and this pair of glasses.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   This is the future for everyone who is making fun of the Apple Vision Pro.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   This is what Apple has in mind.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   Yeah, the demos are weird, and people do all sorts of crazy stuff with them.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   What they have in mind is their whole hardware business is going to go away
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   when this technology advances, and they want to be at the forefront.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   So why I think this announcement is important
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   is because the price is coming down.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   When you acknowledge this is what we're trying to do,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   you begin to get competition in the space.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   When you get the form factor for these glasses
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   to be more or less normal glasses form factor,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   and you get the price sub $1,000, the race is on.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   Now you're in a killer app space.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   We're going to start to begin to see widespread adoption.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   So is there going to be a future in which everyone has on,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   just walking down the street, on the subway,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   at their chairs at Starbucks, at their offices,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   where everyone has on basically what looks like thick Ray-Ban glasses?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   Is that going to be the future where everyone has on glasses?
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   I say the answer is yes.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   But I think that feels weird to us right now.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   Could you imagine just everyone you see has these glasses on
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   that can just put screens in front of them when they need it?
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   But is it really any weirder to someone in the 1980s
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   if you talked about a world in which everyone was going to be
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   carrying around a small rectangle with a piece of glass
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   and just looking at it everywhere,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   like holding this thing up in front of their head?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   Like this looks pretty weird.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   And yet now we're completely used to that.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   That you walk into almost any public space
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   and everyone is looking at this thing in their hand.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   If you, in 1982 when I was born,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   if you told people that's what we're going to see
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   40 years from now in the future,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   they'd be like, you mean like Star Trek?
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   Like the thing Commander Kirk looks at
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   when they beam them down to the surface of the planet?
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Come on, you're crazy.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   And now we're completely used to it.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   I think 10 years from now,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   everyone's going to have on glasses.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   Everyone's going to have on glasses.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   It just makes too much sense.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   There'll be some computing device as well.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   It'll be like a phone, maybe a little bit thicker.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   It's going to have like most of your computation.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   Your data is going to be in the cloud.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   This is going to make, we're going to see this,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   there'll be first adopters,
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   but companies are going to be quick to this once the price is right.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Because you can just look at a budget,
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   an IT budget for a company, right?
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   Man, we have to buy all of these computers.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   We have to replace them every three years.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   We have all these projectors in the conference rooms
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   and these TV projectors and those break
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   and we have to replace them.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   We have like the phones people use
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   and those have to be updated
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   and we have to keep the software updated
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   and we have to force people to update the software
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   and all these different devices.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   And to say, what if we just bought everyone
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   a $500 pair of glasses, right?
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   And now every conference room, every desk,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   like we just have all the screens they need.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   It's all there virtual.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   Everything is software based.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   We can update it in the backend as needed.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   It just makes a lot of sense.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   For individuals, like yes, I want five monitors
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   or three monitors or I want my email over here
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   and the thing I'm writing over here
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   and the chat, Slack chat over here.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   Yes, I want multiple monitors.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   People are going to get used to that.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   And if putting on the glasses gives that to you at home,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   at the office, when you're hot swapping desks,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   on the seat in front of you on the Delta flight,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   people will want that.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   The ability to shut off the world
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   and replace it with a virtual reality world,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   I think that will be useful as well
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   when people want to focus.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   Hey, I want to focus.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   I want just one screen where I'm writing
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   and I want to be in Mordor or whatever.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Like that's going to be important as well.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   So anyways, I have been pitching this future,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   this end of reality in which screens become virtual.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   I've been pitching this for a long time.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   This is a key milestone.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Other OEMs figuring out,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   oh, if all we need to do is screens,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   we can make these things cheaper.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   This is the beginning of the end for screens.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Now that it's no longer the super high-end products,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   it's not Meta's Quest doing some of this
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   but also doing games.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   It's not Apple Vision Pro trying to do
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   all possible augmented reality things for $3,000.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   It's a smaller pair of glasses
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   that just does screens for $1,000.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   That's going to lead to a smaller pair of glasses
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   that just does screens for $500.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   That's then going to lead to smaller glasses
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   that does the same thing,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   and then we're going to have a real change.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   So anyways, that's my tech corner for this week.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   Keep an eye on augmented reality.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   Forget the crazy stuff.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   This is all about having three screens
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   at your desk at Starbucks.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   We're getting closer to that future.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   I heard, however, their event didn't go well.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   Oh, really?
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Yeah, they had a big event this summer.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   They invited me, but I think the demos weren't ready yet.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   So a lot of people came,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   and they didn't have the visor ready.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   But anyways, I think this direction--
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   I mean, Immerse is going to do well.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Apple is going to have a lower-end product.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   Everyone else--Meta is working on the frames.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   So Meta has the right-size frames
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   with limited functionality,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   and they're working backwards
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   from the frames to the technology.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   People are working on this,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   and again, I think we're so distracted
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   by generative AI.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   We don't realize that this is a technology
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   that's going to have a bigger day-to-day footprint
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   probably on our life.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   So there you go.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   My Tech Corner obligation of the day
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   is spreading the word about that.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   All right, but for now,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   we will shut down our old-fashioned screens
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   because that's all we have to talk about
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   in today's episode.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   We'll be back next week
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   with another episode of the podcast.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   Hey, if you liked today's discussion
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   about working on urgent
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   but non-important household tasks,
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   I think you'll also like episode 317,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   which is about the 10-year rule,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   about how you make progress
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   on very long-term
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   but important non-urgent projects.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   Check it out. I think you'll like it.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   So today I want to talk about
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   a common feature that comes up
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   when you study the lives of people
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   who have embraced depth.
