[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.440]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.800]   insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040]   to live a rich and meaningful life now while building
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.360]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.880]   I'm your host.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.520]   And today, we continue with our series on financial goals
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.840]   that you should set, financial goals
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.960]   that everyone should set.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.640]   This is episode 3 in that series.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.360]   And the basic idea behind the series is this.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.200]   In life, most of us rise to the goals
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   that other people give us.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.040]   And yet, a lot of times, people give us small goals.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.360]   And we hit them and we say, I could
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.400]   have hit such bigger goals if somebody had come along
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.280]   and given me a bigger goal, justified it to me
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.880]   and motivated me to do it.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.960]   And so what I'm trying to do in this podcast
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.960]   is lay out for you the big but achievable goals
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.800]   that would make everyone better off.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.680]   I want this show to be applicable to a 16-year-old
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.200]   young person, or to a 50-year-old person,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.640]   or to a 90-year-old person.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.880]   The idea is to say, what are the goals that really everyone
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.360]   should set?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   Now, of course, most of these are targeted towards people
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.640]   who are just getting started in the beginning.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.240]   But we'll get to some of the other ones
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600]   for the 50- and the 90-year-old person later in the series.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840]   And my hope is that this will provide for you something
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   useful to talk about, talk with your teenagers about,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.760]   talk with young people, and give them
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.160]   just a roadmap of good, aggressive,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.960]   and achievable goals that they should
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   set for their financial life.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.200]   The first goal was get a job.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.520]   If you're broke or if you know someone who's broke,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.720]   the first way to get out of being broke
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.640]   and to start to make good progress financially
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.520]   is to get a job.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.800]   That was goal number one.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.600]   Goal number two was save half, spend half.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   And the basic idea is that if you
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.760]   will restrict your consumption, your spending,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.920]   to 50% of your income, then you will always
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.160]   have room in your budget.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.240]   You will have money available for investing.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.400]   You'll have money available for starting businesses.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.800]   You'll have money available for going to school
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.040]   and getting certifications and degrees that will help you
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.000]   to make more money.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.720]   You'll have money available in case something bad happens
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.560]   and you lose your job.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.680]   By spending half of your income, you
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160]   will always be well-positioned for anything
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.680]   that life can throw at you.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.600]   And even if it's not achievable for some people
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.920]   today because you have high structural expenses,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   the ambition should be to get to the point
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.000]   where you're spending half of your income.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.040]   And if you're starting off, just restrict your expenses,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   stay a few years behind your peers,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.000]   and you'll be decades ahead of them in the fullness of time.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.760]   If you've already established a lifestyle
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.840]   and you need to get to this, then trim your expenses
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.280]   and focus on increasing your income
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.960]   without increasing your lifestyle
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.840]   so you can get to save half and spend half.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.880]   Now, goal number three is very simple and very impactful.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.320]   Give away 10% of your income.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.960]   The goal is that you give away consistently,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.200]   month in, month out, year in, year out, 10% of your income.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.160]   Now, this one is widely known and widely understood
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.640]   because of various religious traditions related
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.880]   to tithing or charitable giving, almsgiving, things like that.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.280]   We all know that we should be giving away some of our money.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.400]   That's what all of our historical cultures teach us.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.600]   But this is also something that very few practice.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.920]   And yet I believe it's one of the most transformative
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.800]   practices that you can put into your life
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   and one that will lead to the best long-term good.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.520]   Why don't more people give away 10% of their income?
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.680]   Well, there are many reasons.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.600]   First, a lot of times they've never been taught to.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.480]   Generally speaking, unless there's been clear
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.760]   and persuasive teaching that has come to somebody to say,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.400]   "Set aside a percentage of your income,"
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.000]   most people tend to give money away on an ad hoc basis.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.160]   Somebody passes the plate in church
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.840]   and you put a $20 bill in.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   You see a bum on the street, you hand him a $5 bill.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.960]   Somebody's in need, you make a one-time payment
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   out of your income to pay your next door neighbor's mortgage
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.720]   when she's in need.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.560]   These are the kinds of things that people do
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   on an ad hoc basis.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.400]   But in general, very rarely have they ever been taught
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   to systematically set aside 10% of their income
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.120]   for the specific purposes of giving.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   And yet this is enormously transformative.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.360]   And it's the most important that you do this
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.400]   when you are young and/or when you don't quite yet
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.480]   have a lot of money.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.160]   There are other reasons people don't do it
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.520]   other than they haven't been taught.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   A good reason that people don't do it
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   is they don't feel like they have very much money available.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.360]   Usually, most of us find it pretty easy
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   to spend all of our income.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.760]   We generally have unlimited wants.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.600]   And unless our income is absurdly ample,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.920]   it's pretty easy to find interesting and fun things
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   to do to consume our income.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   And that's generally what happens.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.680]   That's why we started with Save Half, Spend Half.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.360]   Imagine the difference between somebody
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.680]   who's spending most or all of his income,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.560]   or in many cases, more than his income,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.840]   and all of a sudden we say,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.320]   "All right, you need to give 10% of your income."
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.360]   That's tough to do.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.800]   It takes a little while to work up to that.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.280]   He's not even saving 10% of his income.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.320]   But if we can get the guy to spend half,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.280]   then we've all of a sudden
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.360]   got lots of extra money available.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.920]   And while technically he might get richer
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.080]   by putting aside 50% in savings
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.000]   instead of 40% of savings,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.920]   it's not that hard to go ahead then
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.080]   if expenses have been restricted
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.600]   and give aside 10% of his income.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.040]   Another reason people don't do it
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.560]   is they just feel like the numbers
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.480]   are too small to be meaningful.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.040]   And yet this is, as I see it,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.440]   the exact time to start
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   is when you're not earning very much
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.760]   because you need to build the habits,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.800]   the muscles, and the skills necessary
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.080]   for you to successfully
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.680]   and effectively give away money.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.600]   A lot of people say,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.120]   "Well, someday in the future,
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   I'll get rich and then I'll give money away."
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.280]   And some people probably do that.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.440]   But I have a hard time believing
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.760]   that I would have the character
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.880]   to be able to do that.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.520]   If I am not willing to give $10 out of $100,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   would I really just magically wake up someday
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   and give $10 million out of $100 million?
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.920]   Maybe, but it seems hard for me to believe.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.240]   It seems easier for me to think
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   that even though the numbers
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.280]   may be more generous in the future,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.160]   that I'll be struck with the same fears
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.200]   as I have today,
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.040]   the fears of inadequacy,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.320]   not enough money,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.680]   the fears of loss.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.720]   And more importantly,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.480]   I won't know how to do that.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.120]   One of the things that I've observed
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.320]   doing financial planning
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.760]   for fairly wealthy people
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.000]   is that most people have the ambition
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.960]   to give away money effectively,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.480]   to engage in some form
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.760]   of philanthropic giving, charitable giving,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.000]   investment into causes and issues
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.040]   that they care about.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.480]   Challenge is that when the numbers get big,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.760]   this is really hard.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.280]   I want you to imagine today
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.240]   that I write you a check for $100 million.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.080]   And I say to you,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.320]   it is your job to give away
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.080]   this $100 million in the next five years,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.280]   so that five years from now,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.640]   all of it is gone.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.000]   And you have to do it
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   without causing harm to anybody.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.680]   And you have to do it in a way
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.640]   that's going to make
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.800]   a significant return on investment
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.840]   for these charitable
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.600]   and philanthropic dollars invested.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.840]   You see how overwhelming that would be?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.640]   Where would you even begin?
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.240]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.680]   I've never given away $100 million.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.240]   I couldn't tell you today how to do it.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.960]   And so what you observe is frequently,
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.120]   if people haven't built the skills,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.680]   even when they're good-minded about it,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.600]   they just say here,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.240]   and they shove it all
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.280]   into someone else's pocket
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.720]   to give it away and do the hard work.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.240]   You're Warren Buffett,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.880]   and you want to give away
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.320]   a lot of your estate to charity.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.880]   So you turn around
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.080]   and give it to Bill Gates
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.440]   and say, here, you've got this.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.080]   You've got this.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.720]   You've got this.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   Give it to Bill Gates and say, here,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.680]   you've got the foundation.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.240]   You do it.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.280]   That may be a decent strategic move.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.440]   At the end of the day,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.720]   it's not taking ownership
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.000]   of your responsibility
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.680]   as a steward of significant wealth.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.800]   If you start, however,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.400]   by giving $10 out of your first $100,
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.200]   you'll learn something about giving.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.920]   You'll learn something
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.000]   about investing into other people,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.760]   into needs that you see around you,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.680]   into institutions that you care about,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.440]   into causes that are important to you.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.240]   Then when you're giving
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.840]   $1,000 out of $10,000,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.080]   you'll recognize that
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.280]   I can make a bigger difference,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.720]   so let me be more careful about this.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   Then when you're giving
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.160]   $100,000 out of a million,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   you start to become a really big fish,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.320]   and you really want to return
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.280]   on your giving dollars.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.160]   And then when you're giving away millions,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.360]   you've built a strategy
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.960]   and a vision as to what you're actually
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.280]   trying to do with the money,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.800]   and you've prepared for it.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   Giving is enormously powerful.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.240]   At its core,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.560]   by always giving 10% of your income,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.320]   you are forced continually
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.160]   to defer gratification
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.360]   and to build your character muscles.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.360]   Over the years,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.080]   in the Christian tradition of tithing,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.160]   of giving 10% of your income
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.520]   to your local church,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.480]   there has been a variety of studies
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.000]   that people have done on it,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.200]   and there's abundant evidence
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.560]   that tithing,
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.480]   consistently giving 10% of income,
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.680]   is something that seems
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.200]   to be highly correlated
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.280]   with those who make a lot of money.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.960]   The question is why?
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.160]   Do people just make a lot of money
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.720]   and then give it?
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.240]   I don't think that's the answer.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.160]   I think that the practice of tithing,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   consistently, always,
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.920]   taking money off the top
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.200]   and giving it away,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.360]   has a transformative effect on people.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.360]   It forces people
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.280]   in the lesson of delaying gratification
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.680]   to recognize that I don't have
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.760]   to consume everything that's there.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.640]   And this is one of those
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.080]   powerful character muscles,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.240]   which, when it's developed,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.840]   has enormous impact
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.600]   across every aspect of life.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.400]   If you can exercise control
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.440]   over your money
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.480]   and you can give away 10% off the top
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.360]   before you spend,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.680]   you'll probably have developed
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.320]   the skills of delaying gratification
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.680]   and you'll have a better chance
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.520]   of exercising control
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.880]   over your sexual desire.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.840]   If you can control your money,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.440]   there's a good chance
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.280]   that you'll be a better worker
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.880]   because you have more patience
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.320]   with other aspects of life.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.520]   You build a long-time perspective
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.720]   and the ability of someone
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.320]   to see to the future
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.520]   and delay gratification
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   with a long-time perspective
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.600]   is one of the most reliable indicators
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.280]   of long-term wealth potential.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   So the practice and act
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   of automatically tithing your income
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.440]   and taking a tenth,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.480]   that's what a tithe means,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.760]   it's just a tenth of your income
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.320]   off the top,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   and giving it away
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   builds your character
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.080]   in a way that is truly impactful
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.720]   to your life.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.200]   Giving is enormously powerful
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.520]   because it helps you to experience
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.920]   what it's like to be the person
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.040]   who makes a difference
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.960]   in another person's life.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.600]   Years ago, I heard a lecturer
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.640]   who was talking about,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.720]   what do you do if you just feel
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.320]   like you're at the end of your rope
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.520]   and you can't do it anymore,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.160]   you're depressed,
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.440]   you're in a bad state,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.000]   what do you do?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.040]   Well, the best thing for you to do
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.800]   in that situation
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.440]   is to go find someone else
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.040]   who's in a worse situation
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.160]   and serve that person.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.240]   So go find a local,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.480]   charitable relief effort for the poor
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.160]   and go and start helping other people.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.640]   And that act of helping other people
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.520]   is going to improve your mental state
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.800]   and help you to be grateful
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.160]   for what you have,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.880]   and it's going to fix
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.640]   your psychological problems
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.080]   quicker than many other things.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.640]   Well, that's what giving is.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.000]   When you're giving,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.040]   you're continually thinking
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.240]   about other people
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.840]   and you're continually thinking about
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.240]   where and how you can take money
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.840]   and make a difference for someone.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.080]   And that allows you
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.200]   to start to experience
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.040]   what it's like to be a difference maker
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.000]   in the world,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.840]   which is enormously powerful.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.040]   Giving clues you in
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   to those who are less fortunate than you.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.200]   Instead of ignoring them
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.320]   and walking past them,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.080]   you're instead
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.600]   walking around looking for them,
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.960]   saying, "How can I give money
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.840]   to someone who needs it
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.560]   more than I do?"
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.960]   And this is enormously powerful
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.240]   for your gratitude muscles.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.080]   Causes you to see the world differently.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.760]   Giving causes you to have a reason
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.680]   to work for the long term.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.360]   If we look at the things
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.600]   that we can do with money,
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.000]   which can pretty well be
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.680]   divided into three categories.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.960]   One is we can consume it.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.480]   We can spend it.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.960]   The second is we can invest it
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.240]   or we can build with it.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.480]   The third is we can give it.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.920]   The first category,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.800]   the one that we think
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.000]   will make us happy is actually a dead end.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.560]   Consumption is a dead end
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.080]   because, well, going from total poverty
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.800]   and total lack to comfort
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.160]   has a big impact
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.680]   in our psychological health
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.760]   and happiness and experience of life.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.840]   You quickly get to the point
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.960]   of diminishing returns.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.080]   If you're living in your car
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.280]   because you're broke
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.480]   or you're living on the street
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.680]   because you're broke
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.720]   and you move up to a 300 square foot apartment,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.520]   there will be a,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.720]   because you can consume more
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.600]   and you can spend the money
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.480]   on the apartment,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.560]   there will be a significant impact
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.960]   positively in the quality of your life.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.080]   If you're living
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.840]   in a 300 square foot apartment
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.520]   and you've got a family and children
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.880]   and you move up
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   to a 3,000 square foot house,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.120]   there'll be another significant improvement
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.320]   in the quality of your life.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.960]   But if you move
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.800]   from a 3,000 square foot house
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.040]   to a 30,000 square foot house,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.880]   you won't experience anything
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.400]   like the same quality of life improvement
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.640]   that you did with the first few changes.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   If you don't have any money for food
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.880]   and you go from hungry all the time
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.240]   to having some cheap food
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.120]   that will fill your stomach
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.720]   and cause you to not be hungry,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   you'll experience a big quality of life improvement.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.160]   If you go from having cheap food
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.680]   to having high quality food
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.760]   and enough of it,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.600]   you'll experience another big jump
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.120]   in quality of life improvement.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.680]   But if you go from having enough high quality food
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.200]   to having some cheap food,
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   you'll experience another big jump
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.480]   from having enough high quality food to eat
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.440]   that makes you feel good
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.360]   and meets all of your nutritional needs
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.960]   to becoming a glutton
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.800]   and consciously over consuming
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.720]   at two or three or 10 times more
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.800]   than the amount of food that you need
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.840]   or constantly living in just total luxury
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.800]   just because you can
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.720]   and always buying the most expensive food
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.560]   that you possibly could consume,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.600]   you won't experience the same increase in lifestyle.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.120]   It gets worse though.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.200]   With consumption,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.160]   you're always exposed to the risk of hedonic adaptation.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.200]   Whatever you do, the increase,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.400]   you quickly get used to it.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.000]   So at first you don't travel
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.760]   'cause you don't have any money.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.800]   Then you can afford to travel
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.320]   so you buy bus tickets
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.200]   and you love touring the world in buses
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.280]   because you can go and see the world.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.040]   Then you move up from buses to airplanes
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.560]   which cost a little bit more money
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.760]   and now you're just grateful
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.560]   of how quickly I can travel the world
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.200]   on airplane and how quickly I can make progress.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.560]   Then you go from flying economy
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.720]   to flying business class or first class
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.920]   and you're enormously grateful
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.800]   for the big increase in experience.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.360]   Then you go from business class or first class
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.320]   to flying private and now that's where it's at.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.480]   Here's the challenge.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.440]   Pretty soon you get used to private
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.640]   or pretty soon you get used to first class
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.440]   and all of those same annoyances are still there
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.880]   but now you're used to it
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.520]   and you don't get the same pleasure out of it
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.560]   in the fullness of time.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.320]   We could look at this with the new car effect.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.800]   You go out and you're dreaming of a new car
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.920]   that you really like
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.960]   and you go to the dealership
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.680]   and you buy a brand new car and it's amazing
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.800]   and for the first few weeks
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.920]   every time you get in that car
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   you feel just a total shot of pleasure
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.520]   and for a very few
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.280]   who have very carefully chosen a car
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.560]   that's exactly what they want
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.400]   that pleasure will continue for months
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.880]   and maybe years every time they drive the car
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.800]   but it's nowhere near as intense
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.240]   as it was the first time
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.040]   and now you're just kind of used to it
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.640]   and most cars
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.480]   especially if they're more utilitarian
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.280]   versus something exotic that you carefully chose
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.120]   most cars after a few months or a year
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.240]   just becomes another car.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.040]   You get used to it.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   So with consumption we're always prone
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.960]   to adapt to things
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.400]   and we create a new set point
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.040]   and now it just doesn't feel as exciting
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.840]   as it once was
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.360]   and so many things are like this in life
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.120]   the thing that you dream of getting
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.880]   the thing you dream of doing
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.920]   and then you achieve it
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.200]   and then you're like
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.400]   I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.040]   I always dreamed of having a job
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.240]   where I could travel a lot.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.520]   I gotta go be on an airplane again
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.400]   on Monday morning.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.560]   I always dreamed of having a job
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.480]   where I could draw pictures for a living.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.320]   I gotta create another thing for a client.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.000]   I always dreamed of a job
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.760]   where I could create another podcast for people
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.800]   and just do what I love to do.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.280]   I gotta go and make another podcast.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.040]   Happens to all of us.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.800]   We adapt.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.480]   So consumption and self-indulgence
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.960]   has its place but it's not
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.480]   doesn't grow infinitely.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.200]   Now what about investment?
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.840]   Well investment can grow based upon
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.160]   the thrill of investment can grow
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.320]   based upon the kind of investment.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.160]   If you're doing passive investing
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.400]   as in accumulating stocks
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.000]   and mutual funds and things like that
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.480]   there's pleasure in watching your net worth go up
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.240]   but there's not so much more pleasure
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.600]   when you get to x figures
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.800]   instead of x minus one.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   You're dreaming of when you have a six-figure net worth
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.760]   and then you reach it.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.800]   Okay great.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.240]   Then you're dreaming of seven figures.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.440]   Wow I'm really gonna make it.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.320]   I made it.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.840]   Then you're dreaming of eight figures.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.640]   I'm really gonna make it.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.200]   And the problem is if you're just measuring the money
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   there's always somebody who's more
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.080]   who has more money than you do.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.440]   There's always somebody who is way richer than you
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and who can buy and sell you in a morning
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.960]   and not even notice it.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.000]   So if you're looking for kind of satisfaction
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.120]   purely from the numbers
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.320]   you're never really going to get it.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.160]   Where there is a long runway with investment
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.560]   is if you're investing in business to do something.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.480]   This is closely related to giving.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.000]   If you look at someone who has a passion
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.320]   for a particular business or cause
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.800]   I love to watch Elon Musk with his dedication
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.040]   to making man multi-planetary
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.200]   and okay it's all about we're going to Mars
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.960]   we're going to Mars we're going to Mars
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.280]   and every time he has a company success
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.960]   he's sold the company takes all the money
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.880]   plows it into the next big initiative
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.640]   grows that one makes a bunch of money
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.280]   turns around plows it all into the next big initiative.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.680]   Well he's had this long goal
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.640]   and he needed billions and billions of dollars to do it
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.560]   and he's probably going to do it
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.400]   because he has a huge goal
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.520]   and it's such a huge goal that the thrill
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.680]   of making business bigger and bigger and bigger
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.400]   doesn't have the same diminishing returns
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.680]   because it's not about the consumption
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.720]   it's about the impact.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.760]   But you can achieve the same thing
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.040]   when it comes to giving money.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.960]   When you start to realize how much power you have
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.320]   when you can give money away
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.040]   and you recognize that the more I give
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.640]   the bigger of a difference I can make
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.160]   it's enormously motivating.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.360]   It's thrilling because now you've got to focus
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.560]   and you say I was excited when the first time
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.760]   I gave a thousand dollars away
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.120]   but now I'm going to give a hundred thousand
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.840]   and if I do a million I can support x number of people
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.280]   and I can make this change in the world
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.800]   and we could build this thing bigger
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.680]   and you have that thrill of constantly growing.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.840]   And so those are the two forms of financial growth
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.440]   that have no limit to it
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.120]   and the more people that you can help
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.680]   while probably you get numb to the numbers
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.280]   the bigger the impact of it
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.520]   because you feel confident
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.920]   and you feel like what I'm doing matters
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.800]   and it's rewarding in a way that consumption is not.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.280]   So building, giving, impacting
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.520]   these are things that can grow significantly
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.120]   and giving because you're experiencing it
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.160]   when you start gives you something to grow into.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.000]   You may have a real passion for supporting
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.040]   foreign mission work all around the world
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.600]   and today you can support a missionary
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.720]   and that wipes out your budget
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.200]   to be a small contributor to one missionary
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.320]   but then five years from now
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.640]   you could be supporting five or ten missionaries.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.600]   And in the fullness of time
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.760]   you could be supporting a hundred missionaries.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.680]   Then you can establish a foundation
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.160]   that's going to ultimately impact thousands of missionaries
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.840]   and you can see this grow
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.640]   and there's a long-term growth factor
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.800]   that in some cases can be exponential
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.920]   but it can give you motivation to do everything else
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.640]   to keep working, to make more, to reduce your income
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.680]   so you have more money.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.800]   Some of the people I think who I have met in my life
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.520]   who are the happiest are those who established a lifestyle
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.720]   that was appropriate for them,
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.440]   increased their income enormously
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.040]   and just always increased their giving.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.640]   They went from spending 90% and giving 10%
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.960]   to in the middle and end of their life
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.200]   spending 10% and giving 90%.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:35.040]   I left out the accumulation.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.920]   I'm going to continue to give accumulation targets here
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.320]   but the point is that giving is that thing
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.400]   that ultimately can consume all of your income.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.240]   It can consume all of your wealth
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.160]   and you can be thoroughly satisfied with it
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.200]   but giving is best started when you're young
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.720]   and when you're just getting started.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.680]   So I'd like to give you now some practical tips
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.080]   on giving money away.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.400]   Some things that I think will be useful to you.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.880]   First and foremost, I would encourage you
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.000]   in the same way when I said to save half, spend half.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.760]   Split your income out before it ever comes into your hands.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.600]   If you get paid with a check because it's 1980,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.960]   if you get paid with a check,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.200]   take your check to the bank, cash the check.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.040]   There's $1,000 in the check.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.600]   Take 500, put it in one pocket for spending.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.440]   Take the other 500, put 100 into a pocket for giving
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.440]   and put 400 in for investing.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.560]   Split it up front.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.920]   Now if it's 2024 and you're getting paid,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.880]   then set it up with your human resource director
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.360]   that right off the top, your money gets split.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.080]   If you can, split your money into three accounts.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.640]   Account number one is for spending.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   That's where 50% of your paycheck goes.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.120]   Account number two is for investing.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.200]   That's where 40% of your paycheck goes.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.480]   Account number three is for giving.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.160]   That's where 10% of your paycheck goes.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   If you can't do that with your human resources coordinator
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.560]   or with your job, do it yourself.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.760]   When you deposit a check or you get an amount of pay,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.320]   just take 10% and put it in a separate account
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.240]   and build your giving account.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.760]   Consistently, systematically put the money
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.800]   into your giving account
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.480]   and start to accumulate giving money.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.720]   Having a giving account will cause you
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.480]   to see the world differently
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.400]   because instead of just seeing a need
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.160]   and then wondering how much you can give,
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.560]   you're looking at the world differently
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.160]   because you have an amount to give
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.080]   and you're going around looking for needs.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.400]   You're looking for things that you can do
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.760]   that will make a difference.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.160]   This causes you to be a more ready and willing giver.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.400]   You hear an appeal or you notice a need
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.320]   and you instantly know, I've got money for that,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.800]   I can give it because I've already determined
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.560]   that this is money for giving.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.160]   So you just pop open your phone,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.680]   see how much is in the giving account
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.280]   and give that much, boom, done.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.680]   It's profoundly powerful.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.560]   Whenever possible, you should give at the level
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.920]   where you can make an impact
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.840]   with the amount of money that you have to give.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.960]   If your giving account has a hundred dollars in it
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.120]   and you are getting a solicitation
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.040]   from the American Cancer Society,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.640]   I beg of you not to give the American Cancer Society
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.520]   a hundred dollars.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.440]   They don't need it.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.600]   There's no point.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.160]   But if you take that hundred dollars
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.440]   and you start giving it to homeless people
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.000]   that are on your street living in your town
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.080]   and you go and you talk to them
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.160]   and you buy them a good meal and give them some cash
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.000]   so that they have some money in their pocket
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.800]   and you encourage them and find out what their needs are
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.240]   and maybe get involved with them,
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.600]   you're gonna be giving at a level
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.280]   that's enormously impactful.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.560]   Your giving doesn't always have to be
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.400]   to those who are needy.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.760]   You may just go out in the world
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   and start giving to spread good cheer,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.240]   leave an extravagant tip for somebody,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.640]   bring coffee for all of your coworkers,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.920]   look for ways to just give things away to people,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.680]   pay for the person's meal
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.880]   on the other side of the restaurant
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.560]   or behind you in line.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.560]   Just look for ways to give money away,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.040]   but do it at a level that is appropriate
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.720]   for the amount of money that you're giving.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   When you get to the point
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.560]   where you're giving thousands of dollars
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.080]   and tens of thousands of dollars
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.000]   and hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.880]   I ask you again, keep that same thing in mind.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.680]   If you're gonna give thousands of dollars,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   again, don't give it to the American Cancer Society.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.320]   Find an organization that you think is worthy
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.680]   where your thousands of dollars will be important.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.480]   It's probably gonna be a small organization,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.880]   but that small organization may have an idea
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.320]   that really needs to be funded.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.720]   When you get to the point
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.640]   where you're dealing with large amounts of money,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.960]   then that's the time to consider large organizations.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.920]   And the idea is when you're giving,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.800]   you have a responsibility in giving,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.200]   and you need to demand a certain measure of value.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.920]   You need to demand a certain measure of accountability.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.760]   Giving extravagantly just for the sheer joy of giving
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.880]   doesn't mean that you have to demand accountability.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.760]   If you wanna go and leave somebody an extravagant tip
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.520]   just 'cause you really enjoyed an interaction
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.720]   or you see that the person who is working in a restaurant
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.120]   or wherever you happen to be could really use it,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.680]   just do it.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.800]   You don't need to be accountable for the results.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.920]   And I think that we should continually do that.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.480]   You can be an encouragement to somebody
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   who's needed just for giving it.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.560]   But when you start giving consistently,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.760]   routinely, or sizably,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.440]   then you have a responsibility to be certain
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.800]   that the money is doing good
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.880]   and that the money is not being wasted,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.520]   that the money is actually going to do the thing
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.640]   that is needed to be done.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.200]   And so that's one big reason
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.960]   why you should always seek to give
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.840]   at the level where you're actually going to be impactful.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.600]   The person who's giving millions and millions of dollars
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.840]   may be in the position to demand accountability
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.440]   from an enormous organization.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.200]   And that's what he should do.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.840]   But you should be looking for the same thing.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   When you are giving,
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.080]   be open to giving to individuals
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.000]   and be open to giving to institutions.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.200]   There are many worthy institutions
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.160]   that need and deserve your support.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.680]   The most obvious institution would be your local church.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.360]   If you are consistently giving 10% of your income
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.640]   to your local church,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.160]   and all of your fellow congregants
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.840]   are also consistently giving 10% to the local church,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.760]   your local church will become
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   an important beachhead in the community,
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.360]   will do important things.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.640]   And by working together with people in that congregation,
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.680]   you will be able to be extremely effective
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.080]   because the organization is well-supported.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.840]   Institutions are enormously important
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.520]   and enormously powerful.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.080]   And you can often get a much bigger return
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.520]   on your investment by giving to institutions
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.000]   and just supporting them as a matter of standard practice.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.200]   Because an institution has a clear vision,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.880]   has a team to carry it out,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.200]   has a history, has inside knowledge
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.760]   of exactly what it's trying to accomplish.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.400]   So you should give systematically to institutions.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.560]   You should also give to individuals.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.800]   Individuals often can have their lives changed
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.880]   by another individual who happens on the scene
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.160]   at the right moment,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.240]   who's able to help at the right time.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.960]   So be open to both of those.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.800]   Look for individuals who are in need
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   and see how you can help them.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.280]   Look for institutions that are doing effective work
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.720]   and see how you can support them.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.720]   When you are giving,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.680]   your giving should entail some ad hoc giving,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.720]   meaning a spontaneous one-time contribution.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.520]   And some of your giving should be involved
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.640]   with a continual ongoing support
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.360]   of an individual or an institution.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.680]   Both of these are important.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.840]   It's important that not everything
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.920]   is already pre-engaged in ongoing support
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.960]   because then when you come across a worthy opportunity,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.120]   you won't have any money available for it.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.840]   On the other hand,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.440]   if you're just going through life
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.160]   just responding to ad hoc requests for money,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.440]   then you're not actually building towards anything
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.200]   and you're not actually being intentional
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.160]   about what you're giving.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.520]   By committing to specific people
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.800]   or specific organizations on an ongoing basis,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.400]   you're going to start moving yourself
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.120]   in the direction of actually establishing a strategy
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.760]   for your money.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   What types of organizations do I want to support?
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.840]   What causes are important to me?
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.800]   And you have to go and look for worthy organizations.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.160]   And in addition,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.920]   your giving to organizations
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.720]   or your giving to ongoing commitments
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.800]   will start to provide opportunity for you
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.680]   to be engaged in something beyond giving,
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.000]   to be engaged in a volunteer effort,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.240]   to be engaged as part of the team,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.560]   to be engaged in providing wisdom,
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.480]   counsel, prayer, support, ideas, whatever it is.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.880]   And that will be an important component to your giving.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.560]   As you're giving,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.640]   remember that giving money is wonderful and important
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.240]   and is the primary focus here in this podcast.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:33.520]   Giving time, energy, knowledge, experience, wisdom,
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.160]   all of these things are also important.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.080]   Ideally, you would have the opportunity
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.320]   to contribute more than just money.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.360]   And these things will often go together.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.200]   If you're going to get the real story,
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.640]   you can't just be of how effective an organization is
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.800]   at tackling a certain cause.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.040]   You can't just expect to get that as an anonymous donor.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.200]   You may sit down and write out anonymous checks
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.000]   at the end of the year
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.240]   to support your list of organizations,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.840]   but all you're going to get is a thank you letter
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.000]   and a kind of a standard report.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.920]   That standard report is probably going to be honest
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.520]   and truthful, but you're not really going to know
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.040]   what's happening with the organization.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.120]   But if there's an organization
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.880]   that you're really engaged in
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.160]   and you get involved with it
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.200]   so that you're giving your time and your energy to it
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.760]   in addition to your money,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.720]   now you're going to get the real inside scoop.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.120]   And so back to the concept of scale.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.560]   Ideally, in a perfect world,
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.600]   most of your giving would be being done
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.160]   with people or organizations
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.520]   where you are also closely connected.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.520]   Ideally, they're organizations
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.560]   where you're on the board or you're an advisor
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.800]   or you're very well connected.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.280]   You're a key donor, something like that.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.360]   And those organizations and the scale of these things
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.880]   will change throughout your lifetime.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.400]   It's different when you're getting started.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.080]   It's different from when you're wealthy.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.760]   But the idea is you want to be able to use
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.240]   not only money, but other things that you have.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   This also helps for you
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.120]   to maximize your actual contribution.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.920]   It's one thing for you to anonymously give money
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   on an ad hoc basis to an organization
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.680]   that you think deserves a donation this month.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.880]   That's great.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.480]   It's far more effective for you to give money
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.760]   on a continual basis to an organization
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.680]   that has a mission that you really care about
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.320]   and that you're really engaged with.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.960]   And you're also on the board of directors for that.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.640]   And you're also fundraising.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.240]   And now you're out recruiting for all of your friends
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.200]   and all of your acquaintances
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.360]   to also give to this worthy effort.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.320]   So now the money that you're contributing
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.000]   is being multiplied perhaps 10 or 20 or 30 or 50 times
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.680]   because you're really engaged in it.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.800]   This is the pathway that I want you to be on,
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.920]   especially as you arrive to the middle part of your life
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.400]   where most of the consumption needs of your life
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.440]   are stabilized.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.600]   You've perhaps purchased your home.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.120]   You've established your lifestyle.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.040]   You've bought the things that you needed to do.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.120]   You've saved money for your own financial security.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.680]   Your children are raised or on track to being raised.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.520]   So therefore you have more wiggle room
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.360]   and because you have more wiggle room,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.480]   I want you to be in the point
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.120]   where you're really engaged with some organizations
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   and some people that you really care about.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.440]   And so that you are supporting them financially,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.360]   that's generally always the first thing,
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.800]   but also with your time and energy.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.440]   And then you're multiplying that by engaging with others.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.640]   And this is why it's so important to build the skills
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   and the knowledge over time
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.040]   that comes from starting small with your giving.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.720]   If you can't give money to an organization
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.480]   that you care about, give time, give energy,
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.200]   and look forward to the day when you can give money
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.720]   and use that as a motivation to keep you working hard
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.760]   so that you can give money.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   I want you to always begin with the end in mind.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.160]   Look around at wealthy people,
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.800]   read profiles of wealthy people, talk to wealthy people.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.880]   And what you will generally find
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.560]   is that when someone has passed
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.200]   into that space of financial abundance,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.240]   has more money than he's ever going to need,
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.800]   he or she has more money than she actually can consume
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.880]   even with a profligate lifestyle,
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.720]   with a very high consumption lifestyle,
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.200]   this person is generally looking
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.040]   for something to do to make a difference.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.320]   When he or she has consistently,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.480]   over the course of years and decades,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.080]   engaged in constant, never-ending giving,
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.000]   normally this transition is pretty easy to make.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.920]   Guy says, I know exactly the organizations,
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.960]   these are the ones I'm involved in,
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.480]   these are the causes I'm working on,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.320]   and now I'm going to continue to focus
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.600]   and now I can just give a lot more money,
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.280]   a lot more time to it because I retired
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.640]   and I've got all this extra money,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   now I can really be engaged with it.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.800]   But if a guy doesn't have that history,
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   it's very hard to make that transition
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   because the jump is just too much.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.120]   It'd be like going from zero children to seven children.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.400]   It's not particularly difficult
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.320]   to go from six children to seven children
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.240]   or five children to seven children.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.120]   You might even be able to go
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.280]   from four children to seven children comfortably.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.880]   But you don't go from having a quiet household
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.240]   with two adults to all of a sudden
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.160]   having seven children underfoot.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.000]   That doesn't generally go smoothly.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.440]   You have to grow into it.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.080]   And it's the same with basically everything else in life,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.120]   including giving.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.120]   In conclusion, one of the most powerful things
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.320]   that you can do is consistently give away
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.960]   from the very beginning 10% of your income.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.840]   You do that by having an income.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.680]   Go one, get a job.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:44.560]   You do that by setting your expenses conservatively
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.000]   as compared to your expenses.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.680]   Spend half, save half.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.320]   And you do that by off the top,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.640]   separating your giving money,
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.960]   setting it aside so that it can be invested
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.240]   into the causes that you think are most worthwhile.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.640]   This 10% of your income in the fullness of time
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.000]   will be your favorite 10%.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.280]   The 10% that brings you the most joy.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:12.480]   And it'll be the joy that has almost infinite scalability.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.760]   It'll be the joy that is the least exposed
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.040]   to diminishing returns.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.960]   On the contrary, it'll give you increasing returns,
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   which is truly what you're looking for.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.520]   Some categories in our budget
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.480]   should start small and stay small.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.720]   Some categories, we want to fix them
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.000]   and we want to decrease them.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.320]   Some categories, we want to start them
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.080]   and we want to increase them.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.480]   And giving is that category.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.080]   We want to start it at 10%.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.800]   And then in the fullness of time,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.880]   we want to increase it and increase it
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.200]   and increase it and increase it and increase it.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.920]   That's a recipe for an impactful and fulfilling life.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.680]   That's a good use of money.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.760]   That's why the goal of giving away your 10% of your income
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.960]   should be a goal that each and every man and woman,
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.080]   each and every young person,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.280]   each and every boy and girl installs
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.120]   from the very first paycheck forward.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.240]   - At Cox Mobile, we know you're smart.
