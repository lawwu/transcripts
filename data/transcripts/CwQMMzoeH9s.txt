[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Saksibu, how much heat and momentum has Nikki Haley gotten this week?
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.240]   Oh my god, stop trying to make Nikki Haley happen.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.880]   Fetch is not happening. Stop trying to make Fetch happen.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.480]   Stop trying to make Fetch happen.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.440]   It's happening.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.920]   Is it happening because it's your mom?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520]   This is like my long Google short Facebook spread trade of last year.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.640]   That's so great.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.360]   It's happening.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.320]   Fetch is not happening, okay? Stop trying to make Fetch happen.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:39.360]   [Music]
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.840]   Just as a programming note, we did a Twitter survey and you selected Saks as the person you
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.640]   wanted to moderate the pod most next. So welcome to Fox News Sunday and here's your host, David Saks.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.720]   You're really chafed about this, aren't you, J. Cal?
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.760]   No, I'm excited for it. I am so excited.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.200]   Just to save a keyboard warrior the time, I will never, ever, ever moderate this thing.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   So I'm here to talk.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.800]   All right, three, two. Welcome to the All In Pod. I am your host, the Rain Man, David Saks.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.840]   The famous doomsday clock that atomic scientists used to measure the threat of nuclear annihilation
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.800]   has never been closer to midnight, not even during the Cold War.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.560]   But since the besties think it's more important to discuss their stock portfolios,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   we're going to save Ukraine for later in the show.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   Priorities, right, gentlemen?
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.040]   And why not? Who says you can't take it with you?
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.880]   The dictator, Shamath Palihapitiya, is claiming to be entombed with his money
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   like an Egyptian pharaoh and with his sweaters too,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   even though it certainly won't be cold where he's going.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.640]   And of course, he'll throw in the world's greatest moderator, Jason Kalkanis,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.720]   in the tomb to be his servant in the afterlife.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.040]   It's a role Jake has been preparing for all his life by sucking up to every tech founder
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.400]   and VC he can get in a room with.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.920]   I give better odds to the sultan of science, David Freeburg.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.000]   He's just paranoid enough to survive with me in the bunker,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.120]   even though he still won't be questioning the Davos elites that got us here.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.680]   How much did that intro cost?
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.200]   Does it come with a money back refund?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.120]   I'm laughing. I don't know.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.600]   I'm laughing.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200]   Yeah, I thought it was with you or at you.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.280]   It's good.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.000]   The funniest part was when you almost read aloud.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Like, it's like you were like, and then David Freeburg, insert pause here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.200]   I'm just reading the notes.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.800]   It's an intro. It's an intro.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.640]   I'm so glad we do an unscripted show.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.160]   Freeburg, I remember when you did the intro.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.600]   Come on. Did I read?
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.720]   Actually, didn't we cut it?
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.320]   Yeah, you read and then you cut it.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.040]   You hated it.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.960]   And then we made you put it back in or something like that.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.680]   All I have to say to him is job security is here.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.080]   All right.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.840]   Okay.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.800]   Issue one.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   Issue one.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   Google breakup.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.200]   The just department and eight states are now seeking to break up Google's business,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   brokering digital advertising across the internet.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.280]   This is one of the most important legal challenges the company's ever faced.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.920]   Filed a lawsuit on Tuesday.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.200]   The just department did alleging that Google abuses its role
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.560]   as one of the largest broker suppliers and online auctioneers
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.200]   of ads placed on websites and mobile applications.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.680]   The filing promises a protracted court battle
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.360]   with huge implications for the digital advertising industry.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.400]   Of course, Google responded to the lawsuit in a blog post
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.160]   saying that the DOJ's request for it to unwind two previous acquisitions from a decade ago
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.520]   is an attempt to rewrite history.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.760]   They said the DOJ mischaracterizes how its advertising products work.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600]   They say that people choose to use Google because they're effective
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.360]   and the company highlights other companies making moves in the advertising industry as well,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.760]   such as Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and TikTok.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   So I guess I'll kick it to you, Chamath.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.560]   Do you think the DOJ has a case here?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   Do you believe that Google has a monopoly in online advertising
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.600]   and is unfairly using it to gain market share?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   And is this the right remedy, breaking up the company?
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.320]   Yeah, I think that this is a totally ill-founded lawsuit
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.640]   and I think it just shows more of the personal enmity and anger
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.240]   that some people in the US government has towards entrepreneurs
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   and entrepreneurship than anything else.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.440]   Now, why is that?
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.960]   Let's just think about what a monopoly is.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.240]   A monopoly or a monopolist effectively creates a completely stagnant, non-vibrant market
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.960]   in which they have pricing power and complete control.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.480]   Now, the argument that I think that refutes that just on its face
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   is if you actually look, number one, at their share,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.800]   and number two, how the rest of the share has changed over time.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.960]   So Nick, can you just please throw that up from Bloomberg?
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.680]   This is just in a Bloomberg article that I just shared with you guys, but
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.920]   Google controls 26.5% of a market.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.640]   43.4% of that market is with a diverse group of others.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.280]   Meta has 18.4% and Amazon has 11.7%.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.760]   This is not the type of pie chart you would see if you had a monopolist.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.560]   So for example, if you went back to the big, big, big
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.760]   monopolist case in the 1980s, which is when we broke up Ma Bell,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   well, what that circle would have shown is that they basically had effectively 100% share.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   And what this shows is that there's a huge diversity of people in this market.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.560]   The second thing is that if you had done this chart many years ago,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.360]   Amazon would not have really even been there.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   And over the last five years, they represent almost 12% of the entire market.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200]   And it means that if you forecast it forward,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.920]   they could be at 15% to 20% in a few years as well.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.960]   So while the pie is growing, and definitely Google takes a lot of the profit dollars,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.920]   the distribution is so much more than what anything looks like in a monopoly.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.960]   And so I just think it means that the DOJ is more focused on trying to punish these
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.280]   great American companies than it is in trying to be logical and reasoned.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.440]   And so I don't think this is going to work.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.480]   The last thing I'll say about this is that if you think about what you should have done,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.400]   if I were the US government, I would have actually focused on search,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   because search is a monopoly for Google.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.000]   And while Google would try to argue that there are other ways of acquiring information,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.080]   that is really not true.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.680]   And if you could prove that that monopoly then led to pricing power in ads,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.440]   I think that's a much more nuanced but logical argument that could work.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.120]   But by focusing on this, I think it's going to get deconstructed, it's going to fail.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   The Texas version of this exact lawsuit already was thrown out of federal court.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.360]   So I think that judges and the legal system don't have a lot of patience for this thing.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   It just meant more to kind of scare American companies and try to play bogeyman and
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.640]   decision maker, and I don't think it's going to work.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.920]   Freeware, let me go to you.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.240]   I think, you know, Tramont raises a really great point that if you define the market
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.680]   as digital advertising, that, you know, Google's market share is only about a quarter,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.360]   that doesn't seem like a monopoly.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.240]   However, what the government says is that you shouldn't look at digital advertising as a whole,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.080]   but rather this sort of brokered advertising that, you know, Google does for third-party
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.440]   websites and applications.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.040]   Let me show a chart from their lawsuit.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.800]   You can see here that the way they define it, again, they see it as this brokering of
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.840]   sell-side inventory, which are website publishers, and then buy-side demand, which are advertisers.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   Defined this way, it looks like Google has 90% or more market share on the sell side
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.360]   because of the double-click acquisition.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.200]   They've got somewhere between 40 and 80% market share on the demand side with advertisers,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.880]   and then in the middle, they have over 50% market share of the ad exchange.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.280]   Is this the right way to look at Google's business, or should we be just thinking about
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.200]   in terms of the overall digital advertising market?
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.840]   I've been involved in ad networks since about 2002.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.920]   Obviously, I'm not directly involved in the business anymore, but I was pretty close to
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.880]   this and I was pretty close to double-click and the acquisition.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.360]   I was a business product manager for a period of time on AdWords.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:27.280]   So the way that that chart kind of shows the connection between advertisers and publishers
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:34.240]   is correct, that an ad network, generally speaking, brings buyers of ad inventory to
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.600]   the sellers of ad inventory.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.000]   And the sellers of ad inventory have the option to sell their inventory on an ad network.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.400]   And if the money that they're making on those ad slots that they have, whether it's a slot
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.840]   on the side of a page or the top of a page or an interstitial video ad, whatever it is,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.200]   they're going to keep selling their inventory through that network if they're getting paid
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.600]   the most.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.640]   And the real reason Google has won is two-part.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.080]   One is because they ran their ad network as an auction, meaning advertisers were competing
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   with each other to pay the most for an ad spot that was the highest quality.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.360]   There's also an ad quality index calculation, a click-through index, a bounce-back index.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:19.120]   So there's all this data that feeds into Google's ad network auction so that the ad that's
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.040]   shown on the publisher's site is not just the best ad for the publisher, but the best
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.160]   ad for the consumer.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.520]   And then when the consumer clicks on the ad, the publisher gets paid.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.440]   And the second thing that Google did, and so the auction dynamic is a really powerful
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.280]   dynamic, it creates the best price for the publisher, and it creates the highest quality
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.960]   ad for the user, which translates typically into higher click-throughs and better revenue.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.080]   What they also did that was really powerful is they did the highest revenue share in the
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.480]   market.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.440]   So historically, ad networks had like, I think, initially like a 60/40 red share where they
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.040]   only paid publishers 40% of the revenue the advertiser paid.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.880]   Then the network started to move to a 55/45 model, then a 50/50 model, then a 45/55 model.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.400]   I believe on average, Google currently is paying somewhere between 70 and 80% to their
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:08.960]   publishers.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.880]   I got to check my math on that or whatever the latest report is.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.760]   I heard high 60s, yeah.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.280]   Yeah, but call it 70.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.720]   And so it is a very competitive share.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.680]   Now, the point being, because it's an auction system and because it's opt-in by the publisher,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.280]   if they're not paying the highest price, the publisher can go and get ads from somewhere
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.760]   else.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.880]   And historically, publishers built their own sales force to sell ads and to source advertisers
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.120]   and to make money off of their ad inventory.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.440]   And it turns out it was a lot more effective to use an ad network to do that.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.280]   The other ad networks simply haven't been as good at building an auction model and building
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.160]   competitiveness.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.400]   But I will tell you that when you get to a certain volume, and it's not a big volume,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.280]   you don't need a million advertisers bidding against each other.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   You only need a few dozen advertisers.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.560]   And once you have a few dozen advertisers bidding against each other, you start to get
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.160]   very competitive in inventory.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.720]   So Google's real lock in with publishers and the real reason they win in this marketplace
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.680]   is because they pay the publishers the most.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.320]   And if you try and break this up, and if you actually do try and, you know, get into the
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.120]   weeds of this whole system and change it, the publishers ultimately will make less money.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   And this will be a real problem on the publisher side that they're making the most money, they're
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.240]   getting the highest share of advertiser spend, and consumers are getting the best quality
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.800]   experience.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.440]   That's what makes Google's model so hard to tackle from an antitrust perspective.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.160]   Because it's giving...
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.880]   So basically, it is what you're saying that because fundamentally, this is an auction
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.040]   model, it prevents Google from extracting monopoly rents.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.440]   Correct.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.640]   And, and they already pay the highest share on their ad network back to the publishers.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.000]   And so you could go in and say, hey, high 60s or 70%, they should be paying 90%.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.640]   What's the real right number if they're already paying more than anyone else to the publishers,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.960]   they're already making a lower margin than anyone.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.040]   And I'll say, let me just let me just add two more things.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.080]   Sorry, which I think are just...
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.120]   Okay, I'll go to Jekyll first.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.920]   I just want to get Jekyll in here, even though he wouldn't do the same for me.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.360]   Jekyll, do you agree with Freeberg that the reason for Google's success is that they're
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.240]   hyper efficient?
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.800]   And this auction mechanism prevents monopoly behavior?
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.600]   No, there is monopoly behavior going on at Google, obviously, with search and putting
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.680]   their own content and services up top.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   And to Shamaad's point, like that's probably the easier target.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.720]   Here, this just feels like they are maybe 10 years behind, they should have just blocked
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.120]   the double click acquisition in 2008.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.880]   And this consolidation of power, the...
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.760]   What publishers would say to Freeberg's point is, when you're selling your own advertising,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.960]   you get a much higher CPM when you go direct to Samsung, or IBM, or Disney.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.880]   And so you want to create those direct relationships.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.880]   How much do those direct relationships cost?
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.240]   It's probably 20% or 30%, which is exactly to the percentage that Google is taking off
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.560]   the top.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.720]   So Google is pretty aware of that.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.200]   But it's just paradoxical that they're doing this at this time, David, because Amazon has
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.480]   developed a huge ad business.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.520]   Netflix and Disney now have ad tiers for their services to go up against YouTube.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.600]   So, and then for the first time, we're even talking about Google search supremacy being
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.800]   challenged by chat GPT.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.880]   So, much like what happened with Microsoft, they're just late, 10 years too late, maybe.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.680]   Right, right.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.280]   So to use one of your favorite words is the DOJ acting as a rug puller here for Google
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.840]   in the sense that they're trying to unwind 10 year old acquisitions.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.840]   Yeah, it doesn't make much sense to me.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.560]   Shouldn't the government be able to unwind acquisitions that happened a decade ago?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.000]   Does that make any sense?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.560]   No, of course not.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.120]   No, they should learn from it and not do it again.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.160]   Tex, what do you think?
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.680]   I think it's a pretty bad way to approach things because they create so much uncertainty
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.720]   in the marketplace and has a chilling effect on future acquisitions.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.760]   Like when you get approval from the government, you want to know you're good.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.240]   And we have an approval process.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.600]   So it seems to me, I agree with Jake out, like if the government is going to have a
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.560]   problem with an acquisition, state it up front, but then once they approve it, you're approved,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.040]   you're done.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.440]   Otherwise, you know, companies will be much less likely to engage in acquisitions.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.160]   And that's going to have a chilling effect on M&A behavior in the ecosystem, which is
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.080]   bad for the ecosystem as a whole.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.280]   It puts us competitiveness against every other country and any other regulatory regime that'll
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.640]   be more permissive to this stuff.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.760]   I totally agree.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.040]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.440]   And I think this is what's lost on this.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.720]   I just feel these lawsuits right now are bordering on the mean spirited because these things
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.000]   have been tried.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.600]   They've generally failed.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.200]   And so the real solution, it always goes back to this, and it's ugly and messy is you need
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:51.360]   to rewrite the actual laws to reflect how business conditions exist today.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.240]   And so it's not the responsibility of the DOJ to try to fit around peg into a square
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.560]   hole.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.320]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.440]   And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   They're trying to manipulate and contort the law to try to go after somebody that shouldn't,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.320]   frankly, be gone after because these deals to your point were done a decade ago, and
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.560]   they were done legally, and they were done rightly.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.760]   So if you have an issue with how the market has evolved, change the law.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   Right.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.840]   I'll also add, I totally agree with Chamath.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:26.480]   I think that this action, you know, as one of our friends put it on our on our text stream,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.920]   it's like killing the golden goose.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.480]   I mean, this is one of the big job creators, innovators and taxpayers and employers and
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.080]   drivers of economic growth.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.240]   And why would we allow that to go and kind of burgeon offshore as a government?
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.960]   This is absolutely going to become kind of an opening for some, you know, international
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.440]   competitor to come in and try and provide alternative services with similar economics.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   I'll also say I just sent you guys a link.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.880]   I'll send you one more.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.840]   The market itself is becoming so much more challenging to operate in as an ad network.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.840]   You know, e commerce.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   So Amazon's ad business is booming, right, as Chamath pointed out earlier.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.720]   But so much more of consumer behavior is shifting where people are going direct to e commerce
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.360]   sites.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.320]   And then the ads that are getting the highest click through and where advertisers are spending
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.640]   more and more money is on e commerce sites.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.560]   I know this from experience on a couple boards I'm at, where companies stopped spending on
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.360]   Facebook and Google and just started spending exclusively on Amazon.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.120]   And that's where you get consumers that are much more likely to purchase the purchasing
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.440]   proclivity is higher, the click through rate is higher.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.200]   So the return on ad spend is much higher.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.440]   And then I think that there's a big shift happening right now, as you guys know, with
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.600]   third party cookies, Google has declared that they're removing third party cookies in 2024.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   This means that in 2024, it is going to be very hard to track a user from one website
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.480]   to the next.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.760]   If you go to a website and look at furniture, and then you go to another website, third
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.080]   party cookies, allow an advertiser to find you on that other website, knowing that you
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.920]   were just looking at furniture and send you a furniture ad and say, Hey, come on over.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.360]   And you're more likely to click on that ad.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.600]   It's been very effective for advertising, and particularly in the segment of advertising
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.720]   called retargeting.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.560]   But it is becoming much harder to do this with third party cookies and with the Apple
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.680]   identifier being yanked.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.800]   And Google just made an attempt to try and get this change with a W three C that was
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.440]   rejected.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.600]   And that change is now going to make this hit very, very hard beginning in 2024.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.200]   So the ad networks themselves are already being massively hurt by apples.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.400]   ID changes, the third party cookies being removed, it's becoming harder to target consumers
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.120]   harder to make money as a for publishers.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.960]   So meanwhile, the market's being challenged.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.760]   Amazon's coming in.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.800]   This is the inverse definition of a monopoly.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.840]   When you have a market where there is dynamism, where companies are changing the rules, and
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.480]   that is reallocating share gains to different players.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.760]   That's the definition of a dynamic market that self regulating.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.920]   Totally five years ago, this would have made more sense.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.280]   Yeah, much more sense.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.440]   So I think this goes back down to one basic thing, which is do our elected and appointed
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.360]   officials really understand what's going on in the economy.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.720]   And I think this is an example that highlights not as much as they should.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.600]   And before a lawsuit like this gets filed, they should call us up.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   If they called 30 of us into a room one by one and said, Can you please explain how this
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.400]   works, you would have come to a different conclusion, because we could have articulated
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.640]   these things, and it would have been clear.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   And so why do they not do that?
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.000]   Or if they do do it, who's actually in there?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.720]   Either way, whatever's getting to the conclusion of let's go file this lawsuit in 2023 is late
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.000]   at a minimum and misguided at best, you know, you have to ask the question, like, how is
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.160]   this different than Xi Jinping saying, you know what, Jack Ma is too powerful.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   Therefore, he's going to learn to pay.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.840]   I think this is like, our government saying Google, it is totally different.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.640]   Totally different.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.440]   Other than that, it's the same.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.920]   I think that this lawsuit makes no sense.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.440]   You always have to bring it back to China.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.640]   Does everything in your brain have to virtue signal like it's like,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.160]   No, I'm trying to be intellectually interesting conversation.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.280]   Jason, Jason, we could be talking.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.920]   He's still manning an intellectually honest position.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.480]   Exactly.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.200]   Let me finish, let me finish, Tamar, let me finish.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.600]   Before you jump the fence.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.720]   Very simply, you asked, like, why are they filing something that makes no sense?
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.000]   My position is, I think they want to have an outcome.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.960]   And their outcome is they want to stick it to big tech because it's too powerful.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.080]   And then you just said yourself, square peg round hole.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.480]   They're trying to find something to get Google on.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.520]   This is not it.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.040]   How does it relate to China?
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.960]   I kind of agree with J Cal here, actually, I'll defend him for a second.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.840]   Right, just world second, world second greatest moderator.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.800]   Yeah, third greatest.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.320]   Take China out of it for a second, because that could mean that could mean a lot of different
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:50.800]   things.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.880]   And so I don't want to get hung up on that.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.720]   But it does feel to me like the government is lashing out against companies like Google
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   because they're perceived as being too powerful.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.240]   That's my that's what's going on.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.480]   And in fact, I mean, that's Lena Khan's theory is that we have to stop big tech companies
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.960]   from getting bigger because power.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.160]   But in this case, it doesn't make any sense because the auction market for advertising
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.720]   is very competitive, and the remedy of unwinding 10 year old deals doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.960]   So yeah, they're just kind of barking up the wrong tree is sort of the idea.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.120]   There's two other things that they really should be looking at as these ad networks
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.640]   are losing their market share in the overall digital ad spend.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:38.080]   There are two other players, Disney, you know, and Netflix doing these digital ads on their
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.360]   platforms and having ad tiers.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.320]   And then you may have noticed Uber is doing an ad business now.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.800]   They did $350 million in the first year of that business, a million a day, and they're
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.720]   projected to do a billion next year.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.560]   And those have location information in it because you have your destination.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.640]   And so those opportunities are emerging.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.840]   It's a dynamic space.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.000]   I just want to say like, you guys are making like, I think a really important macro point,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.960]   which is like in a marketplace, it's always easy to hate the winners and claim that their
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.160]   success is unfair, if you're not part of it.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.960]   And I think that just because something successful in a marketplace doesn't mean it's a monopoly.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   You know, this whole thing of envy, you know, we've, we've heard from like the Berkshire
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.840]   shareholders meeting, I think there was a good conversation around this, but envy really
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.640]   is ultimately the doom of innovation and democracy.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.040]   It's like you see the success, you want to take down the successful, nothing can be too
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.520]   successful, or else it has to be destroyed.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.560]   And then, you know, as we talked about, it's going to go somewhere else.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.280]   Well, I mean, just play devil's advocate with it on that free bird.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.640]   It sounds like we all agree that the government has kind of the wrong theory and is barking
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.440]   up the wrong tree here.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:54.160]   However, isn't it the case that Apple and Google are too powerful, maybe not in this
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.960]   auction, advertising auction marketplace, but when it comes to the App Store, I mean,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.800]   they have an operating system monopoly with iOS and Android or duopoly.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.560]   But I think you're, you're bringing up the key point, which is these nuances are the
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.360]   ones that matter.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.960]   There is a body of law today, David, that you can apply pretty intelligently and thoughtfully
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.640]   to that exact problem, and also to Google search.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.080]   And so it's a bit of a head scratcher why the DOJ hasn't spent the time to figure out
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   to even understand that that's actually where they should be focused, because that is where
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.400]   there is truly in the app.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.920]   True monopoly power.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.880]   It's a duopoly.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.400]   So it's very clear.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.320]   The share shift has already been set.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.720]   There is no share shift happening to a third player.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.800]   There is no side loading that's really happening.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.760]   And so domestically in the United States and Western Europe, there's a de facto duopoly
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.040]   complete control, completely inflexible inelastic pricing.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.640]   That is a monopoly.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.280]   And then separately for search in the United States, it is also an effective monopoly.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.720]   And those are the things where if you really wanted to go after them because you think
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.240]   there's some damage being done to people, I would have focused there.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.200]   But the ad business has nothing to do with any of this and just means that they don't
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.880]   understand how the market works.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.200]   Right.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.440]   Okay.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.400]   So shifting gears, Microsoft has just been sued on antitrust grounds, or rather there's
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.760]   a probe by the EU.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.640]   And this was based on a complaint actually from Slack.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:27.680]   Slack filed a complaint back in 2020 that Microsoft was basically engaging in bundling
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.760]   or tying of products.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.960]   The allegation is that Microsoft unfairly ties Microsoft Teams and other software to
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.280]   its widely used Office suite.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.800]   Do you guys think that's a better claim?
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.200]   Okay, so I mean, I'll just say like, you know, there was an episode that we did, I
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.000]   think back in September, where I basically railed against Microsoft for exactly this
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.880]   kind of bundling.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.400]   It seems like the EU has picked up that theory and wants to go after bundling.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   We did Slack Series A, I was on the board, took it public, blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.040]   I'll tell you the thing that we talked about a lot.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   That was the thing that I was always like the most afraid of, which is how can we compete
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.000]   with a better product in the face of superior distribution?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.200]   I think what Microsoft did was anti-competitive, but I don't think it was monopolistic.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:26.080]   And I think that the EU in that time has a much better framework of laws that they had
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.520]   demonstrated up until now.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.200]   They were willing to enforce around anti-competitive pricing.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:38.400]   And so part of what Slack was trying to do was create some airspace for that to get
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.800]   into the ether to the discussion that it's like, we could build the best product in the
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.520]   world.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.880]   But if Microsoft gives it away with this other product that is quasi essential, they'll
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.760]   always beat us.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.080]   And there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.120]   What do you think?
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.480]   And I think that was basically the question that was posed to the European authorities,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.320]   because we thought that they would pay attention to it.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.640]   What's interesting about it is that then, you know, when the acquisition happened to
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   Salesforce, it sort of waters down that claim, because now Salesforce also has a set of really
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.320]   essential products that are useful and needed in the market that Slack can go and attach
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.960]   themselves to.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.480]   And in many ways, David, it forced the hand of Slack to be acquired by Salesforce.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.880]   And if not Salesforce, it would have to have been somebody else.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.120]   But could it have been an independent company had we not had to compete against teams in
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.680]   that way?
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.920]   Meaning if we had to compete against another well funded startup, would it still be public?
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.240]   I suspect so I don't think we would have sold to Salesforce.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.200]   Well, that's exactly was my point.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:46.480]   When we talked about this last time is that if Microsoft can basically clone the sort
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.200]   of the the breakthrough innovative product, you know, just to say they do one every year,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.880]   and then they put a crappy version of that in their bundle.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.920]   Yeah, 10% or 50% worse, but they give it away effectively for free as part of the bundle.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.200]   And then they basically pull the legs out from under that other company.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.520]   So it can't be a vibrant competitor.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.160]   And then the next year, they'll just raise the price of the bundle, right?
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.600]   And they've done that with Slack.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.360]   They've done that with Okta.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.720]   They've done that with Zoom.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.960]   You know, Jake, how can we have a vibrant tech ecosystem, at least in B2B software,
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.520]   if Microsoft can just keep doing that indefinitely?
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.320]   Yeah, it's it's a difficult question.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.600]   I don't know, though, if what the consumer harm is here, if you keep adding great features
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.160]   to a bundle.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   So to take the other side of the argument, you know, Zoom has now added channels like
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.880]   Slack, Slack has added huddles, which are essentially Zoom calls.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.400]   And now they're both going to try to add the coda and notion.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.760]   Wiki, wiki style, you know, documents to both Zoom and Slack.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.200]   So everybody's copying everybody's features, everybody's incorporating everybody's features.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.320]   It takes a little bit of time.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:58.160]   This is actually a lot better behavior for Microsoft than the old days when they would
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.440]   do something called vaporware.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.640]   They used to announce products to chill people from buying them.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.280]   So they would announce a Slack two years before Slack came out just to get people to not install
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:07.520]   Slack.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.480]   They did that with Lotus Notes.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.400]   They said that a Lotus Notes competitor coming for two years, and it never materialized.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.840]   So I think the marketplace will compete.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:21.120]   And if you look at Slack itself, it's still growing the same percentage growth it did
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.280]   inside of Salesforce that it did as an independent company.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.240]   So it's growing at a similar pace.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.040]   I don't know about that.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.800]   Wait, Nick, can you pull up this chart?
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.480]   Yeah, it was like high teens or something.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.960]   Was there, was there, it looks like from this chart that Slack has kind of leveled off.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   That's the number of users I was talking about revenue.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.560]   If you look at Slack's revenue, quarter over quarter, it's basically been the same.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.280]   Wasn't there a report that it's been a little bit of a disappointment to Salesforce or no?
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.520]   Well, I mean, you know, this number here that we're looking at, where it says 75 million
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.680]   Microsoft Teams members, 12 million Slack members.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:57.120]   By the way, if you wanted to, if you wanted to play conspiracy theorist, maybe that's why
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.240]   there was a falling out between Benioff and Brett.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.800]   I mean, Brett was the champion of this deal, you know, $28 billion acquisition.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.160]   And $28 billion, it's threading a needle.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   The only one of that scale that's really worked out definitively has been LinkedIn.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.760]   So if Slack hiccuped in a moment when we also had a regime change in rates and valuations.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:25.120]   Now look at Benioff is looking down the barrel of a activist investor program from Elliot.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.640]   Man, I mean, yeah, maybe it's not doing as well as they needed it to.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.120]   I got the sense that Benioff was genuinely sorry that Brett decided to leave and that
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.840]   it was voluntary, voluntary on Brett's part, and regretted basically, as opposed to,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.000]   you know, a non regretted termination.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.600]   I have no idea.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.360]   Like I said, I was pre qualifying with saying let's play conspiracy for a second.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:45.840]   Fair enough.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.240]   Fair enough.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.480]   Okay.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.800]   I have a suggestion.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.080]   Here's a suggestion for the regulators that are listening or watching our podcast.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:00.880]   A really valuable thing for the industry that you could do would be to introduce transparency
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.760]   on ELAs.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.920]   What are those enterprise licensing agreements?
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.360]   These are these things that these big companies use to throw everything in the kitchen sink
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.120]   into a deal when they sell to a company.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.800]   But if there was transparency, and there was a sense of how those things were priced, so
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.640]   think of it like the FDA saying, here's you have to publish your ingredients, right?
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.560]   And what percentage of it is this and that?
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.880]   It would be really beneficial because it would slow down the tendency of these big companies
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.640]   to try to kill the small companies with these poorer products.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.880]   And something around ELAs and more transparency around pricing to the market could be a good
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.800]   governor without having to go down the path of all this antitrust legislation after the
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.360]   fact.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   I think there is some good advice for regulators there.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.720]   I think they should focus on anti competitive tactics, and like clarifying what those are,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   as opposed to some of these crazy lawsuits to break up companies that don't seem to have
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.000]   well grounded theories.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.480]   It'd be I think better to focus on the specific tactics that create the harm and identifying
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.440]   what those are.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   Jake, out of your point about how what Microsoft is doing doesn't seem to be harming anybody,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   it seems to be benefiting consumers.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.200]   I think that's a valid point, but I would bring up a different example, which is if
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.680]   you look at the anti competitive behavior of dumping, where a company will basically
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   dump its product on the market for free, destroy all the other competitors, and once they're
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.040]   out, they can raise prices because the barriers to entry are high.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.800]   There's a huge cost of like, basically entering the industry.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.320]   I think that this bundling behavior is a form of dumping, where in the short run, it looks
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.280]   like consumers are benefiting because they're getting a Zoom clone for free, or a Slack
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.400]   clone for free.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.960]   But then what happens is once they've hobbled those companies, they raise the price of the
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.680]   bundle.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.840]   So I think if we want to have a healthy long term ecosystem, I think this type of like
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.600]   bundling behavior is bad.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.040]   I think it's anti competitive.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.840]   It's a great point.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.840]   But I think there's a very specific solution for it.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.440]   You don't need to break up Microsoft.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.880]   What you need to do is require that when they create a bundle, every product in that bundle
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.040]   needs to basically have an individual price.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.280]   Exactly.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.120]   And the price of every product in that bundle should add up to the cost of the bundle.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.600]   So they can't do, like you said, Chamath, these like transfer payments or subsidies
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.400]   to basically, you know, take over, systematically take over every SaaS vertical.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.360]   I think that would be amazing.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.960]   By the way, there are many other markets, David, where that exactly exists, where if
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.120]   you have the ability to preferentially put your product into your distribution channel,
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.760]   you have to transfer price it transparently at the market.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.080]   And it's what everybody else would be able to get it at.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.720]   And that then allows the best product to win in the market.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.280]   And it gives the government the ability to say, I understand that these rails are roughly
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.360]   monopolistic, but I'm going to leave them alone.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   As long as you treat everything that sits on top of those rails equally.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.320]   And that nuance is missing in software.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.720]   So I think the combination of transparency in these enterprise licensing agreements,
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.600]   and more transparency and accounting treatment for what you just said, would solve a lot
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.640]   of this problem.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.800]   And you would have a more vibrant ecosystem where the big guys can't just snuff out the
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.480]   small guys whenever they want.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.000]   Yeah, I just agree with you guys.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.200]   Let me just let me just play.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.440]   Let me just play my devil's advocate, which is kind of how I feel as well.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.320]   I think these concepts of monopolistic bundling made a lot of sense, I make a lot of sense
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.560]   in the sense in if what you're bundling and the service or the product or whatever is
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.760]   a commodity product.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.720]   And these statements that you're making, assume that one messaging service is the same
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.560]   as a must another messaging service that one video app is the same as another video app.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.200]   And that by giving a discount, they're going to win the market.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.640]   The reality that may have made sense back in the day when there were things like the
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.160]   day when there were things like trains and trains had a monopoly on where things could
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.840]   go or electricity or oil production, and all of the kind of origins of kind of monopolistic
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.800]   antitrust laws and action started to kind of emerge here in our free market in the US.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:12.400]   But when it comes to software, if your product is the same as the other guy's product, maybe
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   they deserve to win by bundling.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.080]   And maybe it's okay for them to offer a discount and beat you on pricing.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.320]   Because if your product is actually better, and it provides better ROI for the customer,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.240]   it has a better feature set, it's faster, it has a bunch of stuff that the other product
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.640]   doesn't have, the market will pick it.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.760]   It's not that the market's gonna say, hey, we're just a bunch of idiots.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.280]   These products are so differentiated.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.320]   But because these guys are giving me a discount, I'm going to go over to the discount.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.280]   That's not how it works.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.320]   And you guys know this.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.960]   I'm not saying that Microsoft can't copy Slack and then undercharge a different price and
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.520]   charge a different price and a lower price and discounted.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.600]   What I'm saying is they can't cross subsidize their Slack competitor.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.000]   It's the fact that they can copy Slack that makes Slack that means that Slack should lose
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.360]   the fact that that's like,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.160]   I disagree.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.280]   Almost all software is look, software, new software is really hard to create, but really
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.000]   easy to copy.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.240]   I mean, the first version of a new product is hard to create, but you can reverse engineer
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.680]   almost any software product.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.240]   Show me where someone's made a better competitor to Google search.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.920]   Show me where like consumers don't choose to go to another search engine because Google's
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.040]   built a better search engine.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.240]   No, it's because there's a data network effect there that the more searches they provide,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.600]   the more data they get.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.880]   It's the reinforcement learning.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.080]   I'll say I'll say differently.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.440]   It's easier to copy.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.360]   There's an asymptote to that quality point, though.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.640]   I don't think that that's necessarily true.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.000]   No, I think I think there's a nuance here that and by the way, all the social networks
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.040]   that people thought were had massive lock in effect turns out they don't write David.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.000]   No, that's not true.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.080]   Look, there's more lock in deeper in the stack that you exist.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.560]   There's very little lock in at the application layer.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.840]   So workflow apps, which effectively is what most of these enterprise software things are,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   are very copyable because there's nothing that really locks it in.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.120]   But if you're a social network, or if you're some deep machine learned thing that basically
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.360]   generates great search results, that's much harder to copy because more and more of the
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.520]   product and it's like generates the product quality is underneath the waterline.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.120]   But I think in enterprise software, it's all thin UI layers on top of very simple.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.560]   Don't compete, then don't compete because the bigger guy that offers a discount is always
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.120]   going to beat you.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.600]   What he's saying, which I agree with is you just if you could add transparency so that
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.360]   you understand what is happening.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.600]   I don't think anybody's against transparency.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.120]   Nobody should be against it.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:33.360]   And if Microsoft wants to charge a penny a seat for teams, then they should be allowed
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.840]   to do that.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.360]   I don't think we're saying that they shouldn't.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.960]   A lot of startups have used the opposite tactic where they've entered with free offerings
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.440]   or free services, and then they try and upsell later.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.040]   And we don't complain about that.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.160]   There's a lot of ways to compete.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.680]   There's no bundling.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.480]   There's no bundling.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.520]   There's a lot of ways.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.240]   But that's my point.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.920]   There's a lot of ways to compete in the marketplace.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.960]   If the product you're offering is of parity, the problem is a commodity that no, but build
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.680]   something that's different enough that people are willing to pay for it.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.360]   Well, then, you know, they're willing to pay more than they'll pay the big guy that's giving
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.400]   them a bundling discount.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.680]   Just build a better product.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.360]   Then the whole b2b SaaS space should basically pack up shop and go home.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.240]   We should just stop funding VC should stop funding new SaaS companies because and all
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.640]   those productivity gains will just go out the window.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.160]   Yeah, why would you fund any
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.400]   anti competitive them?
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.080]   Yeah, how's that bad for the customer?
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.280]   They're paying less and they're getting a better probably fewer new products created.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.480]   Yeah, freeberg at the limit.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.880]   What you're basically saying is because Comcast is a monopolistic provider of my internet
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.120]   connection, I should have to take their video offering and will never use Netflix.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.160]   No, it's like they have they offer a commodity.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.280]   That's my point.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.360]   If you're offering a commodity, these things should apply.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.480]   It makes a ton of sense.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.600]   But what you're saying, but what you're saying effectively, and what you just said is that
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.680]   b2b software is effectively a commodity.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.640]   Anyone can copy it.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.840]   Anyone can replicate said to you, I'm turning this off.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.760]   You only have one choice and it's mine because these is my rails and I built it.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.240]   You would turn to the government to help you because you would say but Netflix is a better
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:58.720]   product.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.840]   And what David is saying is the exact same argument.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.720]   So my point is, unless you also believe logically that you're allowed to turn off Netflix, if
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.560]   you're Comcast, and take their crappy VOD service, then you're you're at least intellectually
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.600]   consistent.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:18.000]   Well, if you don't believe me to steal as a commodity to and you can't engage in dumping.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.880]   I mean, this is the argument is that, for example, you know, with respect to China,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.360]   the argument was that they were dumping cheap steel in the US market to drive all the US
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.720]   producers out of business.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.640]   And then once they were out of business, they'd raise the price.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.480]   The point is, there's all these examples where we have had the intelligence and the
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.240]   ability to be nuanced about this to see that these things are possible and they shouldn't
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:38.960]   exist.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.200]   We don't let Comcast turn off Netflix.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.080]   Okay, we have a law around that.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.720]   I understand.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.000]   So my so I think what we're saying is embrace and extend this law for these new markets
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.480]   that didn't exist 50 and 100 years ago when these laws were written, so that the same
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.680]   benefits that we have in the steel market, and in the cable market, we have in the software
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.840]   market, it'll just create a healthier ecosystem.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.880]   Jekyll, you want to get in on this?
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.600]   I just I wonder when you install teams, does it automatically when you install the Microsoft
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.240]   Office suite, does it automatically install teams?
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   Because it does seem the default there matters.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.000]   Do people have to actively turn it on?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.520]   Or is it actively built in?
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.000]   And so the bundling of it, I think matters.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.520]   And then interoperability matters.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.160]   So there are other vectors here to force some interoperability.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.120]   So if you open your Windows machine, do you have a choice of it depends which browser
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.640]   let's just, let's just say that you use exchange for certain things.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.480]   But in other things, for example, to manage your namespace, you may use Okta.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.280]   But then they say, actually, no, we need you to use our version of Okta.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.720]   It all becomes complicated.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.200]   I think it's too complicated for a government to understand.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.600]   So I think the general thing is, can we extend the definition of these basic rules that we've
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.880]   agreed to in other markets to include technology?
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.320]   And would we be better served?
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.360]   And I think for the most part, I do think it would be it would better serve startups,
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.840]   it would better serve the folks that want to build
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.400]   how would that work in practicality, though, you would, you would
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.720]   have office, they'd say, here's no, I think when they've turned it on for $1 a person
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.640]   or something, here's introductory price.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.000]   I think the combination of what David said, and I said would do the trick, which is if
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.240]   you force these highly complicated license agreements to be transparent, it would not
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.280]   allow them to dump.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.640]   And then the second thing is that all of that transfer pricing that goes into that license
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.200]   cost needs to sum up to the cost itself.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.640]   Now, why is that important?
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.640]   You can learn about how they prevent this in healthcare.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.320]   So let's take Pfizer, good example.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.760]   Here's a company with $30 billion on the balance sheet, right?
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.240]   And Pfizer has a need still to subsidize all of the R&D of their drugs.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.320]   And you would say, well, yeah, they have $30 billion.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.480]   So they should just take the money off the balance sheet and do it.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.680]   Why don't they do it?
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.280]   It's because the accounting laws and all of the complicated anti competitive laws say,
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:07.600]   well, if you want to take this cash pile and use it over here, it goes from an asset liability
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.080]   item, 30 billion of cash, and all of a sudden, I'm going to net it against your EPS.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.200]   Alright, Chama.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:19.920]   There's an actual cost for these companies to do this stuff, to bundle to cross to all
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.320]   of this stuff.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.040]   And so what do they do?
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.960]   They go into the market, they ask startups to build stuff, and then they buy it.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   That's the kind of market I think is better for us.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.680]   Yeah, let's have that be the last word on this topic, because we've been going for a
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:29.760]   while.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:36.240]   But I'm glad you brought up Pfizer, because this brings us to issue two, which is and
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.400]   I think we can show this credit meet for David.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.440]   Yeah, so Albert Bourla, who's the CEO of Pfizer went to Davos last week, and he probably
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.840]   expect to Davos, you know, the conference of the surplus elites.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:53.120]   And he expected probably nothing but softballs and fawning treatment from the establishment
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.600]   media.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.760]   And instead, he probably had the most uncomfortable walk of his life when two reporters from
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.520]   Rebel News approached him outside the Brunner and started asking him some tough questions.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.480]   Let's roll tape.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.280]   What's Rebel News?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.680]   Bourla, can I ask you, when did you know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission?
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.480]   How long did you know that without saying it publicly?
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.800]   Good question.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.600]   I mean, we now know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.280]   But why did you keep it secret?
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.360]   Good question.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.000]   You said it was 100% effective, then 90%, then 80%, then 70%.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.240]   But we now know that the vaccines do not stop transmission.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.520]   Why did you keep that secret?
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.800]   Have a nice day.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.320]   I won't have a nice day until I know the answer.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.280]   Why did you keep it a secret that your vaccine did not stop transmission?
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   We should cut this.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.240]   Okay, we can stop from there.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.560]   Wow, welcome to Info Wars.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.440]   All in Info Wars.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.880]   That's what real journalism looks like.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   First of all, you know what's about to happen.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.880]   That's what real journalism looks like.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.280]   Not a bunch of New York Times reporters covering for powerful people, but asking them tough
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:41:59.760]   questions.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.560]   Okay, is that a legitimate question, Freeberg?
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.040]   Is that a legitimate question?
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.160]   That is a totally legitimate question.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.360]   Freeberg, what do you think of the question?
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.160]   You guys are about to get us downranked on YouTube and Spotify.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.920]   We're about to get warning labels.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   Why is YouTube covering for this sort of thing?
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.040]   By the way, you're right that YouTube banned that video.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.720]   We had to watch it on Twitter because Elon Musk's Twitter is still free.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.640]   Okay, listen, why is YouTube protecting...
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.520]   Why, hold on.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.840]   Why is YouTube abridging freedom of the press in order to protect the powerful CEO of Pfizer
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.640]   from answering questions that are legitimate?
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.080]   Yeah, just look at the questions.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:43.840]   Isn't it a legitimate question of, did they cover up the fact that the vaccine didn't
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.240]   transmit?
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.600]   I think it's a legitimate question that I would actually want to know the answer to.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.200]   I don't know why he didn't just answer that.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.160]   No, we didn't cover it up.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.800]   Freeberg?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.720]   You're asking me if I know whether Pfizer did a cover up?
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.760]   Is that what you're asking?
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.640]   Well, no, it's a legitimate question is what I'm getting at.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.600]   Why are you unwilling to question the Pfizer CEO?
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.640]   Oh, no, I'm not.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.920]   I'm not unwilling to question at all.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.480]   But I'm not.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.920]   I don't think that this is a fight.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   Look, first of all, Pfizer is a commercial enterprise.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.240]   So they have the incentive to make money.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.200]   100%, right?
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.960]   So their objective is to sell a vaccine.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.640]   I think they're making 10 to $15 billion on this vaccine this year.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:26.880]   You're absolutely right that the economic incentive is there for Pfizer to continue
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.440]   to push and rationalize the sales of this vaccine.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.600]   The efficacy of the vaccine waned very quickly.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   As this virus evolved and mutated, it became pretty evident pretty fast that
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:45.360]   the rate of transmission in vaccinated people continue to go up.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.080]   And you know, this may be a function of the quality of the vaccine or the efficacy of
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:55.920]   the vaccine, more likely a function of the fact that the virus as predicted, evolved,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:01.200]   and therefore the antibodies that are produced and the T cell response that's induced by
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.880]   the original vaccine becomes less efficacious over time.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.760]   So the real question is a policy question, a behavioral question.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.000]   But look, Pfizer didn't have another product to sell.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.880]   So it certainly makes sense for them to continue to sell their product.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.240]   And there is still good data that represents that there is some immune response and some
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.720]   benefit in certain populations to continuing to get a booster and all this stuff with the
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.280]   original.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.560]   Yeah, let me ask you about the data.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.720]   The fact that Pfizer only has this product to sell is not exactly a ringing endorsement
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.280]   of their behavior.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.600]   But let's stay on the data for a second.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.080]   There was a study in Nature, which is, you know, one of the most preeminent scientific
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   journals about the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, which is basically inflammation
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:47.600]   of the heart tissue, which can basically lead to heart attacks, saying that the risk among
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.400]   young people, especially young men in 18 to 24 years was elevated.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.320]   If they got the vaccine, this was a study out of France.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:04.720]   So it's pretty clear that the vaccine was efficacious, we thought, but is it less safe
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.600]   than we thought as well?
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.680]   I generally don't know the answer to this.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.960]   I would like to know.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.080]   It's an important question.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.560]   And there's a lot of work being done to uncover it.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.440]   And here's a link to a paper that was published in the journal circulation is the name of
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.800]   the journal, not too long ago, by a team led by a researcher at Mass General.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.440]   And what this and so just to address the myocarditis question.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:35.360]   And just so everyone that's listening knows, I take a very objective view on all this stuff.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.960]   I don't have a strong bias one way or the other.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.200]   So the Mass General team identified 16 people that had myocarditis that were vaccinated
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.000]   and 45 people that didn't work part of their control group.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.160]   And they tried to understand what the difference was between these two groups.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.880]   There have historically been three kind of theories about why there is incidents of myocarditis
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.320]   in certain populations that get the COVID vaccine.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.600]   And by the way, the incidence rate is still typically less than two out of every 100,000
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.200]   people that get the vaccine.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.960]   But as you saw in the paper you just shared, and others have validated it, it can be as
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.320]   high as 30 times more likely to happen in young people that take the the Moderna vaccine,
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.480]   which is still a low incidence, but but 30 times higher is significant and worth worth
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.360]   understanding.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.560]   So the three kind of reasons are the three ideas 30 times higher.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.920]   That sounds like a lot.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.880]   Yeah, so the reason and also small base, but yes.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.040]   And so the three ideas are the three theories around why this is happening.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.680]   Number one is what's called protein mimicry, where certain people, the protein on their,
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.440]   their heart tissue, for example, or certain proteins found in the cells in their heart
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:45.680]   tissue, maybe look like the some element of the spike protein that's created by the vaccine.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.720]   Therefore, when you make antibodies to bind to and clear your body of spike protein, it's
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.280]   also binding to your own cells and causing an auto immune response.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.920]   And those are called kind of auto antibodies.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.160]   The second is just general immune system activation that maybe genetically some people are predisposed
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.040]   to having a very active immune system in response to the vaccine.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.920]   And therefore, with a very active immune system, they get inflammation and damage.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.640]   And then the third is this idea that there's just massive proliferation of your B cells,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.000]   some of which have auto antibodies and some of which therefore destroy your heart tissue
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.440]   and cause this inflammation.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.760]   So what this team did is they looked at the blood difference between people that had myocarditis
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.560]   and people that didn't, they found no auto antibodies, they found no big changes in the
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.960]   T or B cell populations, meaning that there isn't a big immune system activation difference.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:37.520]   The big difference that they found was that the people that had myocarditis actually had
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.160]   a lot of the spike protein floating around in their blood, whereas the people that didn't
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.400]   did not have the spike protein floating around in their blood.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.040]   So this answers one question, but but opens up many more doors, which is what's really
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:49.600]   going on.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.440]   So if you have spike protein in your blood, and your body's not clearing it,
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.840]   right, well, how long after getting vaccinated?
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.600]   Were the spike proteins still floating around?
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.680]   Because I remember when the mRNA vaccine first came out, they said it was the spike proteins
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:07.120]   would go away after a couple of days, three weeks, three weeks, have they done a study
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.600]   like, you know, six months after a year after?
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.520]   Not yet, but that's that's being done right now.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.560]   So what they're identifying is what's going on with the immune system of these this population,
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.120]   where their body is not able to clear the spike protein.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.800]   And when their body doesn't clear the spike protein, a bunch of cytokines and other
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.960]   inflammatory things start to get released.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.280]   And it causes inflammation on the heart tissue.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.000]   Because, you know, there's a particular reason,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.120]   Jake, I'll ask you, I remember, I remember when, you know, the vaccine first came out.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:42.000]   I remember Rogan almost got cancelled for saying that if he was a young person, a young
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.040]   man, he's like 50.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.280]   So he got vaccinated, but he said that if I was a young person, in my 20s, I would not
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.720]   get vaccinated.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.440]   Yeah, because I don't think the risk return makes sense.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.600]   And he almost got cancelled for that.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.880]   Was Rogan right about that?
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:04.080]   So, you know, I have been thinking a lot about this decision to get vaccinated or not, and
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.520]   how we came to that decision.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.480]   And then I think what Freeberg said earlier is super interesting.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:16.400]   The because the virus mutated, the efficacy of these vaccines, obviously, changed and
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.680]   wasn't necessary.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.960]   And so I think it was a moving target to understand if you should take it or not.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.920]   It was a very personal decision, clearly, for people who were over 65 years old, the
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.000]   chances of dying were pretty significant.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.040]   For people under that a certain age, it was lower.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.440]   So everybody had to make a very personal decision here.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:41.520]   Was it a personal decision when you had vaccine mandates?
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:49.200]   And then on top of that, on top of that, you had the media were dunking on anti-vaxxers
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.320]   throughout 2021.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.880]   Remember that?
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   I mean, they were saying about anti-vaxxers that that if you didn't get the vaccine, you
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.440]   got sick, there wouldn't be a hospital bed for you.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.000]   There was, you know, a lot of like dancing on the graves of these people.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   Where, you know, there were like all these articles, you know, there'd be like some
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.160]   preacher who, you know, said don't get vaccinated, and then they would die of COVID.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.880]   And there's a lot of like morbid sort of ghoulish like articles dancing on their graves.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.520]   I mean, it was not this objective personal decision.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.280]   There was tremendous social and legal pressure to get vaccinated.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:19.760]   You're right.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.480]   Was there not?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.120]   You're right.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:21.600]   There was.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.240]   And I think part of the reason I myself got vaccinated was because I wanted to be able
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:26.960]   to travel again.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.600]   I wanted to be able to go to Madison Square Garden and watch the Knicks.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.360]   And I also thought, well, I don't want to be if I'm overweight, like one of the people
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.640]   who dies from this.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.840]   So, you know, we all sat here, we all got vaccinated.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.400]   Do we regret our decision to get vaccinated now that we see this, you know, studies like
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.600]   maybe it wasn't necessary.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.560]   And also, it was apparently oversold.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.040]   So when the Pfizer CEO won't say when they knew it wasn't going to stop transmission,
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.720]   I think it's a valid question to investigate what Pfizer knew and when and just keep everybody
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.360]   accountable for this for future things that happen.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.800]   Because right now, we're in a position where if Pfizer is not being honest with us, if
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   the origin story of COVID isn't being honest with us, these conspiracy theories are now
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.360]   starting to start to look like reality.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.400]   Let me go to you Chamath.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:20.000]   I mean, so we were all felt this tremendous pressure in 2021 to get the vaccine, right?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.600]   We all care about our health.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.160]   You care a lot about your health.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.360]   We all thought we could trust the experts that the vaccine was both efficacious and
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.160]   safe.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.080]   We know it was not efficacious in the sense that they're telling us that we have to get
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.880]   revaccinated every two months for it to work.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.360]   On safety, I don't want to get over my skis because we only have some data.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.560]   But clearly, like this myocarditis data is not good.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:51.280]   So were we basically stampeded into making a decision that was not actually good for
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.000]   us?
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.760]   And would you make that same decision today?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.640]   Let's just lay the foundation for understanding how we got here.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:04.400]   So there are these pathways inside the FDA to get drugs approved.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:10.160]   And if you take a normal pathway for a normal drug, you're going to spend nine or 10 years,
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   maybe more 12, 13 in some cases, and more than a billion dollars to get a drug approved.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:21.840]   And the way that it works is in phase one, you do a study on toxicology, effectively,
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.440]   like is this safe or not safe.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.160]   And you have to have enough people take it.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.360]   And you need to observe them for enough time, where that phase one outcome essentially says
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.800]   this won't hurt people.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.000]   It's benign.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   We don't know the mechanism of action.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.440]   We don't know whether it's going to solve the problem, but we know that it's safe.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:45.760]   And then in phase two, you then try to really understand the mechanism of action.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:51.920]   And if that works, you go into phase three, where you actually scale it out, you create
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.160]   a double arm study, you may do a control group, you may do an open label companion, you may
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.160]   overpower it with 1000s of people.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.800]   And the FDA is incredibly rigorous.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.680]   Okay, even down to like, it's incredible, by the way, like how you're allowed to open
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.320]   the results.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.880]   And they have all of these services that make sure that you can influence the results or
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.560]   manipulate them.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.120]   It's incredible.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.720]   The FDA has an incredible process.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.120]   The thing is that they also have a way to jump around that fence.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.120]   And that is what we use for the COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:30.720]   So in a molecule 13 years, if it's for a really important drug, you can shorten it to six
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:38.160]   or seven with this thing called breakthrough designation for a biologic 12 or 13 years.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.440]   But if you get this thing called our mat, six or seven years, so you're still talking
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.200]   years and 1000s of people, David.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.800]   But then there's this one special asterisk that exists inside the FDA called emergency
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.760]   use authorization.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:58.960]   And in moments of deemed emergency, you can shorten even six years down to in some cases,
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.080]   six, seven, nine months, a year, two years, right?
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.240]   Are you you're describing operation warp speed.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:10.960]   So that emergency use authorization fast track these vaccines to market.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.240]   Now, the thing to keep in mind is there are still two classes of vaccines.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.480]   There are the messenger RNA vaccines, that's the biontech and Pfizer ones.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.880]   And then there are the more regular ones that in many cases, the West was dumping on Astra
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:27.520]   Zeneca and Johnson and Johnson, as we used to, we used to ship those to developing countries
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.000]   and say, we'll just keep the mRNA once you guys think Dave Chappelle had this funny joke,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.320]   I was like, I took the J&J vaccine, right?
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:41.120]   But it turns out that now when we're looking back, the long tail of issues may actually
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.280]   apply to these things that were fast tracked these mRNA vaccines that were fast tracked
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.160]   under emergency use.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:46.480]   Why?
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.720]   Because of what freebrook said, this protein mimicry thing is something we don't understand.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.000]   Now, why don't we understand it?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:01.200]   It's because our tools are not precise enough to exactly know when we engineer these solutions,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.160]   that it only binds to this specific protein.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:12.400]   And what we're learning is that there, these proteins are some, they're so similar, that
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:17.440]   there can be a little collateral damage, that this other thing that looks 99% will also
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.000]   all of a sudden, attract this, this antigen.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.760]   So this is a very complicated body of problem.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:31.120]   And because we didn't give it enough time to bake in the wild, we're learning about
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.560]   this thing in real time.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:38.480]   If you, if we had gone to what you had suggested, which is a massive masking mandate, while
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.440]   this stuff played out, could the outcome be different?
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.400]   Well, we don't know because we didn't make those decisions.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.160]   But I think that's what people will be debating.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.200]   The last thing I'll say on this is specifically to myocarditis.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.480]   I have an interventional cardiologist in LA.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:58.320]   I've seen him every three years, ever since Goldie passed away, out of respect for Goldie
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.080]   and Cheryl, who initially asked me to go, but it's been a great thing that I've done.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.600]   I've learned a lot from him.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:07.520]   He introduced me to PCSK9 inhibitors and a bunch of things.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:11.760]   He called me two years ago and said, "Shamath, I want to do a study that," or a year ago,
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:18.240]   "I want to do a study that looks at actually myocarditis and the effects of this vaccine."
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.120]   And Nick, I don't know if you can just throw it up, but we published something.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.960]   And basically, you know, what we see, David, is that for folks with myocarditis,
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.920]   you're releasing troponin.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:33.120]   And this is a protein that you would otherwise use to figure out whether you're having a
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:37.200]   heart attack or severe, you know, some sort of heart abnormality.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.480]   And so it just goes to show you that there is some collateral damage in some cases.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.600]   In this example, this is one case that we published, which is a 63-year-old white woman.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.200]   I'm saying that implicitly so that people understand that these things really matter
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.640]   on age, gender, and race.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.840]   All of the data that comes out of France really was focused on, I think it was 18- to 34-year-old
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.960]   males of all racial persuasions.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:09.040]   And we thought that this issue is prevalent only in males, but we've had a few cases that
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.680]   we've talked about now that touch women as well.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:19.280]   So it's a complicated set of things because our tools are not fine-grained enough to engineer
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.200]   the drug for incredible specificity.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.160]   And I think that's the thing that we're dealing with now.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.920]   And by the way, last thing, because of all this, it probably is reasonable to take a
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:35.600]   step back and have a commission that just uncovers all of this stuff.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.920]   Look, we've had commissions for things as benign as steroid usage in baseball.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.320]   Like if steroid usage in baseball...
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:49.120]   And this goes back to Rebel News asking Berla a very simple question, which is, what did
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.800]   you know and what did you know with respect to the efficacy and safety of these vaccines?
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.960]   If they did not tell the public that these vaccines did not work the way they were supposed
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.800]   to because they want to keep minting money, that is a legitimate scandal and we have a
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.520]   right to know.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.360]   But Freeberg, let me ask you a question here.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:09.840]   I think Chamath talked about this sort of sped-up process to cut through red tape and
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.320]   get a vaccine to market more quickly.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.880]   I personally actually think that that kind of process is fine for patients who want to
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.160]   assume the risk.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.560]   As sort of a libertarian, I support that.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:26.400]   But I go back to the fact that people in many places were not given a choice.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:32.160]   They had to get vaccinated or they could lose their job or their freedom to participate
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:32.960]   in society.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.800]   And now we're finding out that they may have been forced to do something that in their
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.520]   particular case may not really have been a great cost-benefit decision for them.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:50.800]   What do you think that the sort of impact is going to be of this just like socially?
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:56.960]   I mean, you've talked about, I think that there's a decline in trust of institutional
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.160]   authority in the US.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.920]   And that's a huge problem.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.520]   I mean, isn't this going to contribute to that?
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:08.080]   Yeah, look, I mean, I think that there's been institutional authority overreach that's been
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.000]   building for quite some time.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.160]   And, you know, look, I mean, you guys can go back to our first episode and our earliest
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:19.920]   episodes and I wasn't and haven't been and I think the first time I tweeted, I tweeted
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:24.320]   about the adverse impact that lockdowns could have and we should be weighing the cost of
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.240]   the lockdowns against the benefit.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:31.440]   And ultimately, the benefit was zero, because we ended up accumulating, call it $10 trillion
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:36.400]   dollars of, you know, $4 trillion dollars of net costs that we have to pay off at some
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.560]   point and not to mention the economic consequences of the lockdowns.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:47.360]   And, you know, the benefit was negligible because the virus continued to spread and
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.800]   evolve and there was no way to really stop the virus in its tracks.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:56.080]   Hindsight is 2020 fog of war lawmakers made decisions.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.680]   Was it the right decision?
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.800]   Would you have made the same decision?
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.200]   It's really hard to say you feel like you're saving the world.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.160]   When the world is ending.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.800]   It's easy to kind of act with some degree of what is now viewed as overreach.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.480]   I do think that the mass vaccination requirement may have also been deemed overreach given
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.400]   the limited data that was available and the rapid evolution that was pretty apparent in
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.080]   the virus at the time as well.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:25.200]   But vaccines are required for a number of other illnesses in a number of school systems
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.800]   around the country.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.680]   You know, you start to question, I think we will start to see people question whether
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.480]   those are appropriate.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.280]   But again, those are longer studied, better understood.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   The cost benefit analysis is much there.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.920]   Yeah, actually, I think I think you're right that one of the costs of this policy is going
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:50.640]   to be that people will stop trusting vaccination in general, even though I think that these
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.680]   COVID vaccines, I'm not even sure you can really call them vaccines.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.520]   I mean, every other vaccine that I've ever heard of completely prevents that disease.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.760]   The polio vaccine ended polio.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.200]   The MMR vaccine ended measles, mumps and rubella.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.720]   The COVID vaccine just didn't work.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.240]   I don't think it was a vaccine.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.760]   But I think now what's going to happen is people are going to have a lot more distrust.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:20.400]   There's a tremendous amount of post activity rationalization going on where once you kind
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.840]   of made a statement that the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus or stop hospitalizations,
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.520]   and suddenly it doesn't and you've made that statement with such surety and brevity and
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.880]   funded it with so much money and cost such cost in doing so at that point, you're too
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.600]   far removed to go back and say, you know what, it doesn't.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.120]   And as we're seeing now, the consequences of not being willing to say that you were
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:50.640]   wrong, maybe far greater than the consequences of kind of continuing or kind of, you know,
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.280]   making this change.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.120]   So it's a good point.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120]   All right, final question to Jake on that point.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.600]   So, I mean, Jake, I'll look you were dunking or at least concerned trolling on anti vaxxers
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.120]   during this time period.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.880]   Do you reconsider that?
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.880]   I mean, in other words, everybody was saying that the anti vaxxers were these stupid,
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.160]   unsophisticated people?
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:16.480]   Well, yeah, I, I think that maybe but maybe it was the elites who were the ones suffering
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.200]   from groupthink.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.480]   I mean, look, and I put myself in this bucket, we will all heard it into this idea, we all
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.520]   took the vaccine, being an early adopter of a product.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.400]   And now we're finding out that it's really didn't do what it said.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.360]   Yeah, we in fairness, we said we knew this was experimental.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.440]   We knew this was the first time mRNA.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.680]   But we also knew like a billion people had gotten them or we when we got ours, we knew
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.440]   hundreds of millions of them are in a hold on, let me just ask the question.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.000]   So let me finish.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.720]   And so I think people made a risk assessment, knowing this was an experimental vaccine,
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.840]   knowing that the COVID was mutating at the time.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.640]   And yeah, it could have been oversold.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   Of course, that seems to be the case.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.560]   I Nick pull up this tweet.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.720]   But you know, we need to I, I think we have to look at because we had this conversation,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.320]   you and I have you were very much in favor of everybody getting the mandate and everybody
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.560]   being forced to get the vaccine.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.000]   I never supported the mandate.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.240]   You did.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.440]   We had a conversation about that.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.800]   Like if should people be able to work?
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.480]   Should people go on trains and your position was trains?
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.520]   No, I did not support a mandate.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.040]   I thought it should always be people's choice.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:27.360]   I did.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.680]   I made the mistake.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.720]   I made the mistake of believing the experts in the mainstream media.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.560]   I think if the last couple years have taught us anything, it's that they can't be trusted.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.200]   The level of distrust we should have is even greater than we thought.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.640]   I never supported a mandate.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.320]   I thought it should be people's choice.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:49.440]   And I certainly wasn't I don't think I was dunking on the anti vaxxers.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.720]   Let's pull up this tweet, Nick.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.040]   My Lord, Trump has cronies of Fox News are killing their own constituents with this anti
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.920]   vax nonsense.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.280]   Do you retract that?
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   Do I retract it?
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.400]   I'm trying to look at the date, by the way, this is this is a tweet that Jason put out.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.040]   What was the date?
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.040]   January 4th.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.760]   Twenty twenty two that sex pulled up just so yeah, that was only a year ago.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.960]   Yeah, I know at this point people were saying that.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.400]   No, I get it.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:22.880]   I get it.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.760]   Look, this is not this is not a rare this was not a rare sentiment, but I'm saying just
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.360]   to give this content by this.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.160]   Well, hold on a second.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:30.800]   I'm just reading it.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:38.960]   This was showing the deaths of from COVID were happening at a magnitude more by people who
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.800]   didn't take the vaccine and we know the vaccine was had reduced deaths.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.760]   So we still know that correct freeberg the vaccine reduced reduces the cases of deaths,
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.080]   correct?
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:56.480]   Yeah, this new byvalent booster, Eric Topol put out a tweet, I gave you guys the link here,
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.080]   where he covered a paper that was done recently.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.040]   And the paper shows a reduction in hospitalization rate and death rate for folks that are getting
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.400]   this new byvalent booster.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.240]   So but again, that is a benefit.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.160]   That is the benefit.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.720]   In one's own kind of personal safety.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.680]   And there's a risk profile associated with that, as sex is pointing out.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.120]   But this notion that the vaccines stop the virus and are a true vaccine in the sense
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.800]   of how we talk about polio and chicken pox or smallpox and this other stuff.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.560]   Not equivalent.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.400]   Very freeberg.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.200]   Wait, that data, how long after vaccination was that data?
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.680]   Because I thought that with respect to the vaccine, one of the big problems is that the
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.320]   benefits only last for two months, unless you're willing to get revaccinated every two months.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.120]   No, look, it's not really realistic.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:50.400]   Generally speaking, this is not like a vaccine in the sense of a smallpox or
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:51.920]   this is a shot.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:56.560]   It's a it's a it's a modest muting of the effects.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.560]   And it's one that people need to take kind of a risk based decision on for one's personal
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:00.720]   thing.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:04.880]   But having mandates on whether or not you can go to school and whether or not you can,
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.240]   you know, be in places and whether or not it's appropriate for workplace setting.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.280]   There's still high degrees of infectiousness with this ever evolving virus.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:18.160]   The virus that we have today is not the virus that we had in February of 2020.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.680]   It's a very different virus.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.000]   And it has evolved to such an extent now and it's continuing to evolve
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.600]   that it's very difficult to say there's a vaccine for this virus.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:33.920]   It's a it's a why won't you just say that this the so called vaccine has been a failure?
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.400]   We don't know.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:34.720]   Hold on.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.080]   I'm gonna fail.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.080]   You're we don't we don't know the full safety implications.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.800]   Like I said, I don't want to get too far out of my skis on that.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.520]   However, yeah, we know the efficaciousness of it has been a failure for that.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:53.120]   It doesn't last long enough unless you're going to get jabbed six times a year,
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.120]   which I don't think anybody here would do that.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.240]   So it's not necessary because it's we hold on.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.440]   There was a time period where it was effective, correct, Friedberg,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.280]   and it did reduce deaths massively.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.760]   So I think that's the issue that we're talking about here is that now the COVID strains are so weak
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.920]   that maybe it's not as necessary.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.760]   But there was a time period where people were not taking the vaccine.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.400]   And Republicans specifically weren't taking the vaccine.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.480]   And they were dying at a much higher percentage.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.680]   So it didn't if you're defining the vaccine is not getting not transferring the disease.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.960]   Sure, it was a failure.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.480]   It didn't block like we thought it was.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.280]   Reducing death, it did work for a period of time.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.320]   If it only lasted for two months, and COVID is still around, and it's basically endemic,
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.120]   it's everywhere.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.040]   How did the vaccine make any difference whatsoever?
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.160]   I think now it's too much.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.280]   But back then it wasn't.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.120]   But you know, freeberg freeberg.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:45.600]   Is that true?
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   What's the question?
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:55.040]   I'm losing track of how long does the the lowering the percentage of deaths the benefits of it?
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.560]   Oh, yes, of low reducing what we've learned is they only last two months.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.440]   Is that true?
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.840]   Yet, it depends on the population.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:07.280]   And yes, there is a decline in the benefit over time, as well as the fact that the virus is
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:07.680]   evolving.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.160]   Those are both two, yeah, kind of independent things.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.880]   And as a result, over time, you know, like, yeah, we got to keep getting boosted or shots and
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.320]   Pfizer is making a great business out of it.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:16.720]   You're right.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:22.080]   There's a massive economic incentive here for them and Moderna to keep this gravy train rolling.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.360]   And there's a massive incentive for government officials, politicians to continue to stand by
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.160]   what they said before, because otherwise, they're going to be called wrong.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:30.960]   And they're going to get beat up.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.460]   Totally.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.080]   I feel like I feel like you're making an effort, you're making an effort to stand by what you
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.880]   previously said, the market, I think we should just come out and say that, look, regardless of
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.680]   where the safety data ultimately comes out, just based on efficaciousness, we can say that this
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.800]   thing didn't work.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.480]   And therefore mandating it was even worse thing.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.840]   Because hold on, we put every we put the drug through this rapid process.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.440]   And we didn't let people make an individual cost benefit decision.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.520]   We basically herded them into this.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.800]   And at best, it didn't do very much.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.560]   I don't think that that decision if you if you make that conclusion, I'm not sure that
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.640]   it gives us a toolkit to do better the next time.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.320]   And I think we've all said this, and Friedberg was the one that first really taught us about
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.200]   this, there will be a next time, unfortunately.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:24.800]   So I think that we have to focus our energy here in acknowledging that the tools that we have
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:31.760]   to create these messenger RNA vaccines, and other types of solutions, we are pushing the
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.520]   boundaries of science and the body is still very poorly understood.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.640]   And so the sensitivity and specificity of these drugs may not be what we think up front.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:47.520]   And as a result of that, maybe we need to find a different way of using emergency use
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.600]   authorization in the future.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.800]   And I don't know, David, to your point, I'm beyond my ski tips on scientific
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.680]   knowledge to know how
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:04.240]   I would say as a minimum, that if we're going to do emergency use, it shouldn't be mandated,
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.480]   let patients decide on their own.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.360]   Okay, let's move on.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.680]   So we have a moment of agreement question for free.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.520]   Would you advise or in your life, would you would you continue to get a booster?
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.920]   Or are you going to consider getting a booster every year?
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.360]   No, if they keep them with them.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:25.520]   And now would you advise parents or, you know, adults over 65 or 70 to get one because those
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.200]   seem to be the high risk group, right?
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.000]   So if your parents said, should I get it or not,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.920]   I would advise advise them to talk to their doctor and their doctor would advise them to do it.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.760]   What do you think most doctors would tell somebody above 65 or 70?
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.240]   At this point, it depends what state they're in at this point, but
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.760]   basically would be split on political lines.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.000]   Unless this virus turns into Ebola, I'm never getting boosted again.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.040]   I'll tell you that right now.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.360]   What about you guys?
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.960]   I'm not getting boosted again.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.520]   No, I'm not getting I think that speaks volumes.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.640]   That's volumes right there.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.580]   That's it.
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.200]   Like we could have just done this in 10 seconds.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:01.760]   What about guys?
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.640]   We are literally not this year will be banned on every platform.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:04.960]   We're not.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.520]   Let's move on.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.320]   No, hold on.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.040]   Freeberg, but the fact that all of us can arrive at that and then we're worried about
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.560]   getting banned tells you how screwed up you're right.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.400]   Our society is like, you're right.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.000]   What we can't like have an honest conversation about this, by the way, the other thing this
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.360]   is going to do, it's going to inflame a large number of people just hearing us say this.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.760]   And it's because people have these deep what's happened is this has now become a sense of
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.960]   identity, a sense of tribalism and a sense of it's a belief system.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   It's no longer about an objective decision.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.360]   We saw this with the mass, the mass became the blue became the blue of the red.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.680]   So now vaccine is basically, you know, it's become tribal, but that's not going but but
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.320]   people need to move beyond that because this is a scientific question of cost and benefits
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.960]   related to this medical treatment.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.760]   Okay, let's just move on.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.240]   There's too much.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.640]   I was speaking to your doctors, not for venture capitalists about your vaccine.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.360]   Yeah, speak to us.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:09.440]   By the way, by the way, speak to your doctor and just remember, vaccine manufacturers have
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.920]   a business to run and politicians have to get reelected.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.720]   All right, let's move on because we've gotten stuck on this.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.880]   Okay, look, there's been some important developments in Ukraine.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.640]   I think we should just cover quickly this week.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.960]   There were a bunch of things the Biden administration said they're going to send Abrams tanks as
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.120]   well as Bradley's and leopard twos.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.800]   The Abrams tank in particular is our best most expensive tank.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.200]   At the beginning of the war, they said they would not send them.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.040]   So they reversed their decision on that.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.600]   Now the Ukrainians are saying they want jets as well.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.440]   That's sort of the next issue that's going to come up.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.640]   The Biden administration also in a New York Times article that came out earlier this week
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:50.320]   said that they were warming to the idea of supporting an invasion of Crimea.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.360]   Some Europeans like Peter Hitchens are getting very nervous about this level of escalation.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.080]   He had a pretty amazing piece talking about the risk of this creating nuclear war.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.680]   And even if the Ukrainians prevail in this war, there was a really interesting statement
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.280]   by Larry Fink at Davos last week saying that he estimated the cost of reconstruction at
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.480]   $750 billion.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:17.280]   And Fitch Ratings Agency says that Ukraine is headed towards default.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.280]   So major, major developments, I think in the war this week, I want to get your guys opinion
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:23.680]   on this.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.480]   We know from history that wars tend to escalate and to be far more costly than the participants
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.520]   ever thought.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.200]   Is that the track we're on now?
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.080]   And in hindsight, knowing what we know now, should we regret that we didn't use every
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.160]   diplomatic tool we had to prevent the war, most notably taking NATO expansion off the
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.640]   table?
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.600]   Freeberg, I'll go to you.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.280]   It's such a tough situation.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.360]   Is the situation escalating to a point where we should be concerned?
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.880]   You know, there's a lot of information we don't have.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:03.760]   And there's a lot of intelligence gathering and conversations and chatter that we're not
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.260]   privy to.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:11.280]   So to sit here and kind of be an armchair mechanic on this stuff, I don't know what
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.400]   diplomatic conversations have gone on or are going on.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.360]   All I know is what we're reading on the internet, right?
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.480]   So I'm not, I don't have private, I don't have private, look, this war is extremely
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.520]   well covered.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.000]   And there are no diplomatic conversations going on.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.360]   So I think we're escalating the war.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.680]   I mean, we got Jake Ellertramoth in here.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   Do you guys have any concerns about the direction this is headed at all?
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.960]   Yes, I'm concerned.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.480]   I also agree with Freeberg that I don't think we have all the information.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.200]   But I'm not exactly sure what we can do right now.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:52.160]   It's it seems like they have decided that there is a play to exert a lot of pressure
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.600]   come the spring.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.960]   And that's something that you've mentioned as a very likely thing.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.680]   And so I guess the calculus on the ground is that there's a way to really push Russia
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.400]   into a corner.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:09.600]   And the only way to do that is with more military support.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.240]   And then on the heels of that, David, the link that you sent is then it's not just the
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.240]   war machine that is now spinning up, but it's the aftermarket financial services infrastructure
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.080]   that's also spinning up or Larry, Larry Fink, even the grift aspect of this war.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.400]   Well, yeah, we're Larry Fink was like, hey, they're gonna need three quarters of a trillion
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.080]   dollars of reconstruction support.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:35.360]   We saw that play out in Iraq as well, where at first it was the war machine, and then
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.040]   it was the reconstruction machine.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.880]   And together, it was trillions and trillions.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.320]   By the way, you know what that's called?
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.720]   Those are called infrastructure funds.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.440]   And those infrastructure funds raise hundreds of billions of dollars to make investments
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.520]   to build new infrastructure in markets that need it and that are willing to pay for it.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:56.320]   And it will likely end up being kind of long term debt assumed by that region to pay to
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.400]   do this work and the beneficiaries will be the investors and owners of those infrastructure
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.200]   funds.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.440]   I think there's two sides to this sacks that are worth kind of noting one is the telegraphing
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.360]   of this decision, because it's not being done secretly, it's being done out in the open.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.400]   There's certainly a calculus to that.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.600]   Why are they telegraphing this?
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.480]   And what do they intend to do with that messaging being put out there like this?
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.680]   And it may be that it's to assert or assume a stronger negotiating position, certainly
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.960]   to go into some sort of, you know, mild, modest exit or settlement coming out of this thing.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.520]   But you're right, the flip side is and the cost here is one of extreme outcome, which
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:40.080]   is there may be a France Ferdinand moment here, where one thing goes too far and triggers
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.760]   a cataclysmic outcome.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:48.080]   And in this case, the cataclysmic outcome is tactical nuclear weapons and tactical nuclear
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.360]   weapons as we've talked about.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.080]   And I think I've I had some conversations and some dinners I shared with you guys with
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.480]   some folks in the intelligence community.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.440]   And this has been talked about by ex intelligence community folks publicly are a key part of
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:08.080]   the Russian war playbook that this is there is a tactical nuclear weapon response system
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:08.880]   that is in place.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:15.360]   And you know, these are very possible paths that we could find ourselves kind of walking
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:15.920]   down.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.720]   Obviously, were that to happen, it would be a massive escalation.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.560]   And you're right, there could be a France Ferdinand kind of moment that emerges by shaking
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.480]   the cage and lighting a fire.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:31.680]   And there may be a stronger negotiating position to get to a settlement faster by doing this.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.560]   I don't have a strong point of view on the probability of either of those and why but
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.080]   I think you know, maybe both are certainly in play here.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.360]   Yeah, it was interesting to me that the Wall Street Journal on the heels of all of this
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.760]   stuff also published an article about Roman Abramovich.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   And the interesting thing about it was a quote in the article that effectively said something
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:59.040]   tantamount to well now that he's proven not as useful, we need to target him with sanctions.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.160]   So I just think that what all of this is, is now sort of they're entering the endgame,
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.840]   David, to use a chess analogy.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:17.200]   And it looks like they're setting the wheels in motion to kind of put all the pieces together
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.800]   for a negotiated settlement.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.400]   Do we know that?
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.840]   I mean, well, but is it the endgame or is it continual escalation?
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   I mean, J. Cal, at the beginning of the war, we didn't want to give the Ukrainians Abrams
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.280]   tanks because they were that was considered too provocative.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.400]   Now we're giving them to them.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:39.760]   I think what's going on here is and I suspected this, you know, from the beginnings that we are
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.200]   trying to engage them in a war of attrition, and it's working.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:49.680]   And so I think the West collectively is trying to further that goal of just making Russia
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:55.760]   economically, politically, militarily, culturally, irrelevant or ankled in some way.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:02.000]   And if you think about what's now happening with energy, you know, his primary export,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.480]   he is going to lose those customers and his customers will be, you know, bottom feeding
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.280]   India, China, low cost, you know, oil, and he is going to be a pariah.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.160]   So what I'm looking at is if there's going to be a negotiated settlement this year,
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.880]   what is the next five or 10 years going to look like for Russia?
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.800]   What is their place in the world going to be?
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.880]   The West is never going to trust them again.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.960]   The Germans are never going to buy their oil again.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.200]   Everybody is going to be looking for ways to distance themselves from so how does he
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.000]   have an exit ramp?
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.320]   And we talked about this from the get go here on this podcast is what's the golden bridge
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.440]   for him to retreat across.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.360]   And we really need to find that golden bridge quickly, because I do think this is starting
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.640]   to look desperate for him.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.720]   The West keeps giving better and better munitions, he keeps losing.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.960]   Economically, he's going to keep losing.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:52.240]   And politically, who would ever want to engage Putin in anything with, you know, any kind
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:58.000]   of cultural or international trade, it's going to be a disaster for him.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.760]   So this war of attrition has to resolve itself with some sort of settlement.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.560]   But we just can't go on for two or three years, can it?
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.400]   I mean, it has to settle at some point.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.080]   Dr. Ken Savage I think that it certainly can go on.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.560]   And I think that history proves that wars tend to escalate and the costs incurred are
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.880]   much greater, in many cases, than participants ever dreamed of.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.560]   And if they had to go and do it all over again, they wouldn't have gotten into it in the first
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.520]   place.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.800]   So yeah, I think this is concerning.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.240]   I think, you know, the crazy thing is-
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.840]   Dr. Ken Savage Do you think it is a war of attrition strategy?
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.640]   Dr. Mark McClendon Yeah, I think it has developed into a war
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.200]   of attrition.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.480]   And I think you're right that-
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.040]   Dr. Ken Savage Do you think that was by design?
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.280]   Dr. Mark McClendon I think there's two possibilities, J. Cal.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:47.520]   I think that the maybe the more cynical or realistic members of the administration think
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.040]   there's benefit in wearing Russia down and grinding them down.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.080]   However, I also think there's kind of a true believer camp that sees pushing Russia out
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.080]   of Ukraine, nothing less than that will do.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.000]   And we have to punish their aggression, maybe they want regime change.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.920]   I think there's dueling factions in the administration.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.480]   Remember, General Milley, several months ago said that everything that the Ukrainians could
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.160]   achieve militarily just about had been done, and they should negotiate.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.080]   And even Jake Sullivan had said that they should take Crimea off the table.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.640]   That was just the leaks a few months ago.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.320]   Now the administration is leaking that they're going to support a Crimean invasion.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.680]   So I think there's these both schools within the administration, the true believers, the
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.920]   more cynical folks.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.800]   And it feels to me like the true believers are on top right now, because we just keep
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.880]   escalating this war more and more.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.160]   And I think that's dangerous.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.760]   That polarizes the outcomes, right?
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.720]   So I think, J. Cal, if you had your way, it sounds like you would grind the Russians down.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.600]   But at a certain point, you would say enough is enough.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:54.000]   And like a poker player, like you do at the poker table, you'd say, "I won my Prius for
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:54.880]   the night.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.960]   I don't need to risk that to win a Tesla.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.960]   So I'm going to cash in my chips and get away, walk up, walk away," right?
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.520]   Yeah, I wish I could do that.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.120]   I wish I could do that consistently.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.800]   Getting up from the table is a rare skill.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.000]   That's right.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.480]   But I'm not sure the administration is getting up from the table.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:17.680]   I mean, I think we've achieved, the American position on this, I think has largely been
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.080]   achieved.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.680]   We've prevented Russia from taking over Ukraine.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.560]   We've prevented, we've basically shifted Europe onto American natural gas.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:27.840]   We've destroyed Nord Stream.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.680]   I think we're close to achieving our major objectives.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.080]   But I'm not sure we're going to stop there.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.640]   All right.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.600]   Anyway, all right, let's move on.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.120]   Freeberg, you have a science corner.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.640]   I was going to share the, this was last week, I think we talked about, talking about it
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.120]   this week.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:52.400]   So there was a paper that is a pretty compelling paper published by a team led out of Harvard
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:23:01.760]   on identifying what may be the core driver of aging and demonstration on an ability to
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.280]   kind of reverse aging.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.480]   So I'll just start really quickly that, you know, in the human body, we have many different
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.640]   types of cells, right, we have 200, roughly different kinds of cells, an eye cell, a skin
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.920]   cell, a brain cell, a heart cell, they all have the same DNA, the same genetic code,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.880]   the same genome at the nucleus of that cell.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.560]   What makes those cells different, and the reason they act and behave differently, is
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.440]   they have different gene expression, meaning different genes in that cell are turned on
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.240]   and off.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.440]   And when a gene is turned on, the protein that that gene codes for is expressed and
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.880]   made in the cell, and the genes that are off those proteins are not made.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.720]   And remember, proteins are the biochemical machines in biology.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:46.560]   So when certain proteins are produced, they do stuff and other proteins don't do stuff
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.720]   and the cell acts and behaves very differently.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.800]   So some cells when you turn genes on and off, you get a neuron, some cells, you turn them
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.000]   on and off, you get a muscle cell in your bicep, some of them, you get a heart cell.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.640]   And so all of these cells are differentiated by the genes that are expressed.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.400]   The general term for the expression of genes is the epigenome.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:14.000]   And an epigenome basically refers to these systems whereby certain parts of the DNA,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.720]   certain segments of genes are uncoiled a little bit.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.680]   So if you zoom in on DNA, you know, there's 23 chromosomes, they're tightly wrapped in
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.880]   these coils.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.640]   And when you go even closer, you see that there's these segments called nucleosomes.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:32.960]   And a nucleosome means it's like a bead, and a bunch of DNA is wrapped around the bead.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.760]   And how closely those beads are together, how much the DNA is wrapped, allows a segment
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:43.040]   of the DNA to be opened up, and then expressed, meaning copies of the DNA are turned into
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:48.000]   RNA, which floats into this thing called the ribosome and the ribosome is the protein printer.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.240]   So the more these little segments of genome are exposed, the more they're expressed.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.120]   And there are certain chemicals, these methyls and acetyls that kind of attach to the genome
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.920]   and certain elements that allow parts of the chromosome to wrap up and get really tightly
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.360]   bound or to unwrap and to express the gene.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.880]   So the epigenome is almost you can think about it like the software, and the genome or the
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.000]   DNA is the hardware.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.280]   And so the hardware basically defines what you can make.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.720]   The epigenome defines what is being made, what stuff is turned on and what stuff is
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.200]   turned off.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.560]   So this paper and this work that was done, historically, we've always thought that aging
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.280]   meant that over time, the DNA in our cells was mutating, and errors were accumulating
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.160]   in the DNA.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.280]   And as a result of those errors, the cells start to dysfunction.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.080]   And what these guys really did a good job of proving with this paper is that it may
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.520]   not be mutations in the DNA that's causing aging, but actually changes in the epigenome,
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.000]   and that the DNA remains pretty stable and pretty consistent over time.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.080]   And the way they did this is they broke the DNA and just so you guys know, every second
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.960]   of your life, about a million breaks in DNA in cells throughout your body are happening,
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.160]   your DNA is being broken up.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.640]   And then there's all this machinery in your cell that fixes the DNA when it breaks.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.560]   Now, what happens when it fixes it, it turns out it's actually really good at fixing it
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.840]   and the DNA doesn't change.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.480]   And we historically thought that the DNA changed a lot, and mutations accumulate over time.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:18.640]   But in reality, what may be happening is as your DNA gets fixed, the epigenome, the acetyl
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:24.720]   and methyl groups on the gene on the chromosome, don't get put in the right place.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.120]   And over time, what happens is the epigenome degrades.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.720]   And this is considered and a lot of people refer to this now as the information theory
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:37.120]   of aging, you can kind of think about making a lot of copies of software, a lot of copies
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.440]   of a photo in a photo printer over time.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.560]   And every time you make a copy, there's a little error, a little error, and those errors
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.520]   accumulate.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.400]   And the errors that accumulate cause the epigenome to change.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.720]   And as a result, certain genes are turned on, that are supposed to be off, and certain
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.440]   genes are turned off that are supposed to be turned on.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.840]   And then those cells start to get dysfunctional, because the wrong proteins are being made
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.240]   in the cell can no longer do what it's supposed to do.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.600]   So what these guys could be the ribosome as well that gets screwed up over time, the printer,
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.440]   the ribosome is a pretty, you know, static protein, it just does its thing.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.120]   And there's hundreds of ribosomes in a cell.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.560]   So you know, if one of them's dysfunctional, it just doesn't do anything.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.080]   And then the other ones kind of step in and do it.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.280]   So the ribosomes are constantly running.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.280]   What these guys did is they basically took two mice, two populations of mice, and they
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.640]   gave the one population of mice a certain thing that caused its DNA to break at three
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.880]   times the rate of the other population.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.000]   And then as the DNA broke, they could, they could see that this mouse population got older
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.760]   and older faster.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.480]   And by a bunch of measures on how do you measure age.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.880]   But what they did is they then measured they then sequence the DNA of the two populations
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.920]   of mice.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.040]   And what they showed is that the older mice, the ones that had their DNA changing a lot,
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.040]   by the way, these were genetically identical mice, the ones that had their DNA broken a
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.920]   lot more, they had the correct genome, their genome was the exact same as the other mice
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.840]   that stayed young.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.400]   And so what that tells us is that it's the epigenome and not the DNA itself that's changing.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.760]   So then here's what they did.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.920]   Remember, last year, we talked about Yamanaka factors, which are these four proteins, these
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.080]   four molecules that can be applied to DNA to a cell.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.880]   And they cause all of the gene expression to reset back to looking like a stem cell.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.360]   Remember, all of those differentiated cells come from a stem cell.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.240]   And when they did that, the older population of mice suddenly started to act younger, and
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.880]   all of the measures of age reversed.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.040]   And they did this across different tissue types.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.040]   They measure this in a lot of different ways, cognitive function, health, cellular health,
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.040]   etc.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:48.360]   And so it is not just a fantastic new proof point of how Yamanaka factors can actually
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:54.320]   reverse age, but it demonstrates that the epigenome itself is what is the core driver
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.880]   of aging.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:59.520]   And you guys remember Altos labs raised $3 billion in a seed round last year.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.480]   And remember, at the end of 21, I said like Yamanaka factors and aging research is going
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.800]   to be kind of the next hot thing.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.960]   I think this paper is going to be one of the seminal papers that really kind of illustrates
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.320]   and proves the point that this epigenome is the driver of aging.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.840]   And as we now are investing a lot of money in figuring out how Yamanaka factors and other
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.800]   transcription factors like the Yamanaka factors can be applied in specific ways to actually
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.600]   reverse aging and cause the cells to start functioning correctly again, and then people
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.680]   will start to act and resolve in a healthy way.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.060]   Once again, there's a lot of work to go between here and there.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:37.160]   But now we have a much more kind of definitive proof point that this information theory of
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:42.560]   aging may be real, that it's tied to the epigenome, and that there are solutions that can work.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.360]   And we have to figure out how to put them together and how to engineer a fantastic outcome.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:51.840]   So really great paper by a team led out of Harvard, I think really validates a lot of
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.560]   the work and the money that's going into the space, both in the public and the private
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.980]   sector.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:00.560]   And obviously a lot of new startups kind of chasing this opportunity to figure out how
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.320]   we can use these transcription factors to reverse aging, and that this may end up leading
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.640]   us to, you know, a much kind of healthy life.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:14.120]   And by the way, when they applied those Yamanaka factors to the mice, the mice lived 107% longer
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.440]   than they were supposed to.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.680]   But more importantly, the health span as it's defined, improved.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:22.560]   So the mice not only lived longer, but they actually lived healthier, they're all the
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.880]   measures of healthiness in the body improved.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:28.840]   So it's a really kind of freeberg, is this going to help us in the next 10 years?
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.480]   It may, yeah, it's very well made.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.520]   There are now some therapeutic
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:42.200]   I feel like science quarter should only discuss things that can happen in the next few years.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.200]   Let's put it that way.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.320]   Or is that the wrong way to look at it?
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.760]   I'll tell you, I'll tell you one way, one thing for sure, you can make you can make
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:50.320]   money as an investor over the next 10 years, in finding the right teams that are going
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.480]   to have the highest likelihood of progressing clinical trials in this space.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.480]   I will say that there may be clinical trials that can come to market really fast, particularly
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:01.440]   with kind of these ex vivo therapeutics, where you take cells out of your body, apply the
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:05.600]   Yamanaka factors, and then put them back in your body for certain tissue types, like i
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.520]   cells, for example, or T cells in your blood.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.160]   There's a lot of ways that this may come to market faster.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:13.920]   And it's not just about reversing your age overall, but reversing the age of certain
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.880]   cell types in your body that can then have profound health impacts in the near term.
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:21.140]   So that's the kind of stuff that's going to start to come through clinical stage sooner
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.140]   than later.
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.320]   And then maybe, you know, some number of years down the road, we figure out a way to reverse
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:29.040]   the age and all the cells in our body, and the whole body becomes more youthful.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.800]   But for now, it's going to be targeted cells in a very specific way to reverse aging and
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.680]   improve health.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.480]   Very powerful, very interesting, lots of investment opportunity.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.000]   And, you know, certainly some some some very smart folks.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.280]   What do you think the realistic timeframe is for like, you know, reversing aging?
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.080]   Because we need that.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.080]   30 years.
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.080]   30 years?
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.080]   Shit.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.080]   But I think I'll be 80.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.080]   But that's when you'll need it the most.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:32:05.220]   But so, wait, so if we live to 80, does that mean we're gonna be able to like live to 100?
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.540]   Because we'll be able to like reverse age?
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.540]   Well, it depends.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.540]   I think the question is, can you live well to 100?
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:11.540]   I think that's the question.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.540]   We don't know.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.340]   But if you could reverse aging?
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.760]   Yeah, but we don't know what that means.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:20.860]   Because there's all kinds of things that you inherit over time that this may not, for example,
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:26.060]   like if you have long term heart disease, I could see how the cells could get healthier,
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.180]   but it can't eliminate the plaque in your arteries.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:32.420]   Right, you know, that's hard calcium.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.820]   So that should that shits there.
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.540]   So you have to live well.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:40.900]   Same with Alzheimer's, like Alzheimer's has plaque, there's a plaque element, but the
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.400]   cause of that and the cellular dysfunction may be reversible.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:50.340]   It could definitely be that like injury rates of older people, hips, knees, shoulders, arms,
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:55.260]   all the sort of like soft musculoskeletal stuff you can you can really do a good job
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:33:00.460]   of because at the same time as you get older, like people intake less protein, they process
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.520]   it less well, you lose a lot of muscle mass as you get older.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.540]   Those are things that I think are like short term solutions.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:10.660]   But no, to be honest with you, Saks, the stuff that really can screw you, which is heart
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:15.220]   disease and brain function, this probably won't do much for a long time.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.620]   So check out Screwed.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:20.340]   I'm in the best shape I've been in 20 years.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:21.340]   I feel great.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.740]   Can you reverse whatever is wrong with J. Keller is that in the pot category?
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:28.860]   Can I do a quality of life shout out?
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:37.020]   I got an email, we all got it from a guy who I won't say just to not to violate his privacy,
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.620]   but he's in Saskatchewan.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:44.940]   He listens to the pod or his father is and made him get a prenuval scan, flew the father
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:49.540]   to Vancouver, they found a five centimeter cancerous tumor on his kidney.
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:56.100]   And three days ago had it removed and looks like guys totally healthy and well, eliminated
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:00.300]   here saying so another live saved.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.580]   But I wanted to show you guys a picture.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:07.380]   So yesterday, I went to Los Angeles to see my interventional cardiologist.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:10.400]   And what they do is they do the what's called a contrast CT scan.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.660]   So they put you into an IV and they put this contrast inside of your neck.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.300]   You want to put throw the picture up, please.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:22.060]   And then they use all the software to actually create an extremely accurate 3d model of your
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.540]   heart.
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:27.620]   And what they can do is go inside of your arteries and actually measure the calcium
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:28.620]   buildup.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:34.180]   I've mentioned this before this, this is a service called heart flow h e a r t f l o
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.260]   w.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.500]   In any event, my calcium score is still zero.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:43.280]   Thank God touchwood keep grinding.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.100]   But I just wanted to put this out there for anybody who has a history of heart disease
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:52.340]   in their family for them or for their parents or what have you.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.300]   If you go and ask your doctor, this is a third party service that they can do it, you go
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:58.820]   get a contrast CT.
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.620]   And you can get a very accurate sense of your heart health.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:03.620]   This is amazing.
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.580]   They they found it's incredible.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.660]   They found that you have a heart.
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.380]   They did find that I have a heart.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.020]   This is this is incredible technology.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:16.500]   Because all of us we would try to find if you had a heart for all this 112 episodes,
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.140]   Dr. Carlsberg was shocked.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.140]   They found a heart.
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.420]   It looked huge.
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:22.420]   It looked like secretariat.
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:23.420]   He's got a big heart.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:28.420]   I do have a big heart boys, as you guys know.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.980]   No, I mean, this is shocking for the audience.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:33.420]   Actual size that can't be actual size.
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:34.740]   It's bigger than this brain.
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:35.740]   It's got a big heart.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   Okay, glad you're healthy, bestie.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:39.820]   That's fantastic.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.020]   So go get go get a heart flow.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.140]   If anybody has heart disease, go talk to your doctor.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.140]   All right.
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.860]   Well, for David Sachs, was it was a moderation?
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.860]   Okay.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:51.820]   Yeah, I mean, listen, it was funny as if you were doing a J. Callum.
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.020]   All right, fairness.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.340]   I'll come back to moderate next week.
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:55.340]   I'll model.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:56.340]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:02.700]   I would give both the Davids a robotic B minus C plus.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:06.100]   I think they're better off opining than moderating.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.100]   Okay.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.820]   And I think that Jason really doesn't have anything interesting to say.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:10.820]   So he's better off moderating.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.820]   I don't know.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.660]   Do you want to like my comments last week?
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.620]   And then we can minimize the number of times he finds any random way to take it back to
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:22.060]   virtue signaling and genuflecting about China.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:29.100]   I was going to ask Jason what he thought about the Cowboys 49ers game where Kittle was an
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.580]   ineligible downfield receiver and they didn't call a penalty.
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:36.860]   Very important catch for that game that again, the Cowboys now losing every single time they
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.780]   get to the playoffs.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.420]   But I didn't want to ask you because I was I thought that you'd veer towards Xi Jinping
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.700]   and some China comment.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.220]   No.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:51.100]   Any genuflecting would you like to do before you go back to your I will admit that the
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.900]   moderation thing is harder than it looks.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:57.000]   Well, it's harder than it looks to be entertaining.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.220]   I think that's the thing.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:03.180]   I think J. Cal an A to A plus on is entertaining.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:04.180]   Thank you.
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:05.180]   A plus.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:06.180]   A plus moderator.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.180]   Get back to your job, J. Cal.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.580]   I will come back next week and moderate.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.860]   I have been under the weather.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.540]   Pass the ball and let us put the ball in the basket.
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:18.660]   I will put the ball exactly where you each like it perfectly.
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:22.300]   Look for some great assists coming next week when J. Cal is back at 100% strength.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:26.260]   Thanks to the Davids for filling in for me for the last two weeks and we'll see you all
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.260]   next time.
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:28.260]   Love you all.
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:29.260]   Love you, boys.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.260]   Love you, guys.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.260]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:32.260]   Rainman David Sasson.
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.260]   We open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:34.260]   Love you, Weston.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:35.260]   I'm the queen of King Kong.
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.260]   Besties are gone.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.260]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.260]   What are you doing?
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.260]   I don't know what you're doing.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:42.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:44.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:45.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:46.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.260]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.260]   I'm just trying to help.
