[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   Naively, I certainly thought that all humans would have words for exact counting, and the
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.240]   Piraha don't.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.240]   Okay?
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.680]   So, they don't have any words for even one.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.720]   There's not a word for one in their language.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.800]   And so, there's certainly not a word for two, three, or four, so that kind of blows people's
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800]   minds off.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.240]   Yeah, that's blowing my mind.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.240]   That's pretty weird, isn't it?
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.360]   How are you going to ask, "I want two of those"?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.360]   You just don't.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.920]   And so, that's just not a thing you can possibly ask in the Piraha.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.160]   It's not possible.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.360]   There's no words for that.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.480]   The following is a conversation with Edward Gibson, or Ted, as everybody calls him.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.640]   He is a psycholinguistics professor at MIT.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.680]   He heads the MIT Language Lab that investigates why human languages look the way they do,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.680]   the relationship between cultural language and how people represent, process, and learn
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   language.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.760]   Also, he should have a book titled, "Syntax, a Cognitive Approach," published by MIT Press
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   coming out this fall.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.840]   So, look out for that.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.560]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.800]   And now, dear friends, here's Edward Gibson.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.580]   When did you first become fascinated with human language?
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.620]   As a kid in school, when we had to structure sentences in English grammar, I found that
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.780]   process interesting.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.700]   I found it confusing as to what it was I was told to do.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.540]   I didn't understand what the theory was behind it, but I found it very interesting.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.100]   So, when you look at grammar, you're almost thinking about it like a puzzle, almost like
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.260]   a mathematical puzzle?
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.540]   Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.780]   I didn't know I was going to work on this at all at that point.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.340]   I was really just, I was kind of a math geek person, a computer scientist.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.740]   I really liked computer science.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.980]   And then I found language as a neat puzzle to work on from an engineering perspective,
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.980]   actually.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.060]   That's what I, as a, I sort of accidentally, I decided after I finished my undergraduate
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.300]   degree, which was computer science and math in Canada, in Queens University, I decided
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   to go to grad school.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.420]   It's like, that's what I always thought I would do.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.140]   And I went to Cambridge, where they had a master's program in computational linguistics,
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.740]   and I hadn't taken a single language class before.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.940]   All I'd taken was CS, computer science, math classes, pretty much, mostly, as an undergrad.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.580]   And I just thought this was an interesting thing to do for a year, because it was a single
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.300]   year program.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.980]   And then I ended up spending my whole life doing it.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.820]   So fundamentally, your journey through life was one of a mathematician and a computer
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.020]   scientist, and then you kind of discovered the puzzle, the problem of language, and approached
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.860]   it from that angle, to try to understand it from that angle, almost like a mathematician
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.780]   or maybe even an engineer.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.500]   - As an engineer, I'd say, I mean, to be frank, I had taken an AI class, I guess it was '83
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.140]   or '84, '85, somewhere '84 in there, a long time ago, and there was a natural language
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.540]   section in there, and it didn't impress me.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.140]   I thought, there must be more interesting things we can do.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.900]   It didn't seem very, it seemed just a bunch of hacks to me.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.780]   It didn't seem like a real theory of things in any way.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.260]   And so I just thought this seemed like an interesting area where there wasn't enough
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.260]   good work.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.940]   - Did you ever come across the philosophy angle of logic?
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.180]   So if you think about the '80s with AI, the expert systems where you try to kind of maybe
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.820]   sidestep the poetry of language and some of the syntax and the grammar and all that kind
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.380]   of stuff and go to the underlying meaning that language is trying to communicate and
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.900]   try to somehow compress that in a computer-representable way, did you ever come across that in your
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900]   studies?
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.380]   - I mean, I probably did, but I wasn't as interested in it.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.940]   I was trying to do the easier problems first, the ones I could, thought maybe were handleable,
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.140]   which seems like the syntax is easier, which is just the forms as opposed to the meaning,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.780]   like when you're starting to talk about the meaning, that's a very hard problem, and it
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.860]   still is a really, really hard problem.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.020]   But the forms is easier, and so I thought at least figuring out the forms of human language,
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.380]   which sounds really hard, but is actually maybe more tractable.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.380]   - So it's interesting.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.420]   You think there is a big divide, there's a gap, there's a distance between form and meaning,
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.780]   because that's a question you have discussed a lot with LLMs, because they're damn good
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.780]   at form.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780]   - Yeah.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.780]   - I think that's what they're good at, is form.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.780]   - Yeah.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   - Exactly.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.780]   And that's why they're good, because they can do form.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.780]   Meaning's hard.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.780]   - Do you think there's, oh, wow.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.380]   I mean, it's an open question, right, how close form and meaning are, but we'll discuss
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.380]   it.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:54.300]   But to me, studying form, maybe it's a romantic notion, gives you, form is like the shadow
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:02.540]   of the bigger meaning thing underlying language, as I, form is, language is how we communicate
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.580]   ideas, we communicate with each other using language.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.860]   So in understanding the structure of that communication, I think you start to understand
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.100]   the structure of thought and the structure of meaning behind those thoughts and communication,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100]   to me.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.660]   But to you, big gap.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.660]   - Yeah.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.060]   - What do you find most beautiful about human language, maybe the form of human language,
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.020]   the expression of human language?
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.460]   - What I find beautiful about human language is the, some of the generalizations that happen
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.380]   across the human language, just within and across a language.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.220]   So let me give you an example of something which I find kind of remarkable, that is if
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.860]   a language, if it has a word order such that the verbs tend to come before their objects,
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.380]   and so that's like English does that.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:59.100]   So we have the first, the subject comes first in a simple sentence, so I say, the dog chased
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.980]   the cat, or Mary kicked the ball, so the subject's first, and then after the subject, there's
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.220]   the verb, and then we have objects, all these things come after in English.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.940]   So it's generally a verb, and most of the stuff that we want to say comes after the
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.060]   subject, it's the objects, there's a lot of things we want to say that come after.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.060]   And there's a lot of languages like that, about 40% of the languages of the world look
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.180]   like that, they're subject-verb-object languages.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:34.500]   And then these languages tend to have prepositions, these little markers on the nouns that connect
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.340]   nouns to other nouns, or nouns to verbs.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:44.100]   So a preposition like in, or on, or of, or about, I say I talk about something, the something
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.260]   is the object of that preposition, we have these little markers come, just like verbs,
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.820]   they come before their nouns.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   Okay, and then, so, now we look at other languages, like Japanese, or Hindi, or some, these are
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.980]   so-called verb-final languages, those, maybe a little more than 40%, maybe 45% of the world's
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.500]   languages, or more, I mean 50% of the world's languages are verb-final, those tend to be
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:17.580]   postpositions, those markers, the states have the same kinds of markers as we do in English,
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.980]   but they put 'em after.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.340]   So, sorry, but they put 'em first, the markers come first, so you say, instead of, you know,
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:32.700]   talk about a book, you say a book about, the opposite order there, in Japanese or in Hindi,
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.660]   you do the opposite, and the talk comes at the end, so the verb will come at the end
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   as well.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.660]   So instead of Mary kicked the ball, it's Mary ball kicked, and then if it says Mary kicked
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.540]   the ball to John, it's John to, the to, the marker there, the preposition, it's a postposition
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.540]   in these languages.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.180]   And so the interesting thing, fascinating thing to me, is that within a language, this
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:05.980]   order aligns, it's harmonic, and so if it's one or the other, it's either verb-initial
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.660]   or verb-final, but then you'll have prepositions, prepositions, or postpositions, and that's
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.420]   across the languages that we can look at, we've got around 1,000 languages for, there's
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:22.760]   around 7,000 languages on the Earth right now, but we have information about, say, word
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.120]   order on around 1,000 of those, a pretty decent amount of information.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.060]   And for those 1,000 which we know about, about 95% fit that pattern, so they will have either
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.660]   verb-initial, it's about half and half, half a verb-initial, like English, and half a verb-final,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.660]   like Japanese.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.300]   - So just to clarify, verb-initial is subject-verb-object.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.300]   - That's correct.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.160]   - Verb-final is still subject-object-verb.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.220]   - That's correct, yeah, the subject is generally first.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.500]   - That's so fascinating, "I ate an apple," or "I apple ate," okay, and it's fascinating
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.660]   that there's a pretty even division in the world amongst those, 40, 45%.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.780]   - Yeah, it's pretty even.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.900]   And those two are the most common by far, those two word orders, the subject tends to
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   be first.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.900]   There's so many interesting things, but these things are, the thing I find so fascinating
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.340]   is there are these generalizations within and across a language.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.540]   And not only those, and there's actually a simple explanation, I think, for a lot of
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.660]   that, and that is you're trying to minimize dependencies between words.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.220]   That's basically the story, I think, behind a lot of why word order looks the way it is,
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.220]   is we're always connecting, what is the thing I'm telling you?
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.060]   I'm talking to you in sentences, you're talking to me in sentences, these are sequences of
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:47.860]   words which are connected, and the connections are dependencies between the words.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.580]   And it turns out that what we're trying to do in a language is actually minimize those
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.580]   dependency links.
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.300]   It's easier for me to say things if the words that are connecting for their meaning are
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   close together.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.500]   It's easier for you in understanding if that's also true.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.820]   If they're far away, it's hard to produce that, and it's hard for you to understand.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.020]   And the languages of the world, within a language and across languages, fit that generalization,
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:21.220]   which is, so it turns out that having verbs initial and then having prepositions ends
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.140]   up making dependencies shorter.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.500]   And having verbs final and having postpositions ends up making dependencies shorter than if
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.500]   you cross them.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.380]   If you cross them, it ends up, you just end up, it's possible.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.380]   You can do it.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.380]   - Within a language.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.460]   - Within a language, you can do it.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.060]   It just ends up with longer dependencies than if you didn't.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.740]   And so languages tend to go that way.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.900]   They tend to, they call it harmonic.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.860]   So it was observed a long time ago, without the explanation, by a guy called Joseph Greenberg,
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.460]   who's a famous typologist from Stanford.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.220]   He observed a lot of generalizations about how word order works, and these are some of
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.380]   the harmonic generalizations that he observed.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.820]   - Harmonic generalizations about word order.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.740]   There's so many things I want to ask you.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.740]   - Okay, good.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.900]   - Okay, let me just, sometimes basics.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.540]   You mentioned dependencies a few times.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.140]   - What do you mean by dependencies?
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.820]   - Well, what I mean is, in language, there's kind of three structures to, three components
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.860]   to the structure of language.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.260]   One is the sounds.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.940]   So cat is /k/, /æ/, and /t/ in English.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.420]   I'm not talking about that part, I'm talking, then there's two meaning parts, and those
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.420]   are the words, and you were talking about meaning earlier.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.300]   So words have a form, and they have a meaning associated with them, and so cat is a full
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.760]   form in English, and it has a meaning associated with whatever a cat is.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.180]   And then the combinations of words, that's what I'll call grammar or syntax, and that's
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.660]   like when I have a combination like "the cat" or "two cats," okay?
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.960]   So where I take two different words there and put them together, and I get a compositional
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.180]   meaning from putting those two different words together, and so that's the syntax.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:04.340]   And in any sentence or utterance, whatever I'm talking to you, you're talking to me,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.980]   we have a bunch of words and we're putting together in a sequence, it turns out they
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:17.020]   are connected so that every word is connected to just one other word in that sentence.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.460]   And so you end up with what's called technically a tree, it's a tree structure, where there's
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.740]   a root of that utterance, of that sentence, and then there's a bunch of dependents, like
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.140]   branches from that root that go down to the words.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.700]   The words are the leaves in this metaphor for a tree.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.180]   So a tree is also sort of a mathematical construct.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   Yeah, yeah, it's a graph theoretical thing, exactly.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.380]   So it's fascinating that you can break down a sentence into a tree, and then every word
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.820]   is hanging on to another, it's depending on it.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.820]   That's right.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.380]   And everyone agrees on that, so all linguists will agree with that, that is not controversial.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.700]   There's nobody sitting here listening mad at you.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.700]   I do not think so.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.700]   I don't think so.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.700]   No one is sitting there mad at this.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.700]   No, no.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.540]   I think in every language, I think everyone agrees that all sentences are trees at some
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   level.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.540]   Can I pause on that?
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.540]   Sure.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:14.380]   'Cause it, to me, just as a layman, it's surprising that you can break down sentences
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.820]   in many, mostly all languages into a tree.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.820]   I think so.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.820]   That's weird.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.500]   I've never heard of anyone disagreeing with that.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   That's weird.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.580]   The details of the trees are what people disagree about.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.860]   Well, okay, so what's at the root of a tree, how do you construct, how hard is it, what
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.180]   is the process of constructing a tree from a sentence?
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.420]   Well, this is where, you know, depending on what your, there's different theoretical notions.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.380]   I'm gonna say the simplest thing, dependency grammar.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.060]   It's like a bunch of people invented this, Tenier was the first French guy, back in,
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.900]   I mean, the paper was published in 1959, but he was working on the '30s and stuff, so,
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:57.980]   and it goes back to, you know, philologist Pignini was doing this in ancient India, okay?
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.420]   And so, you know, doing something like this, the simplest thing we can think of is that
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.420]   there's just connections between the words to make the utterance.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.980]   And so, let's just say I have, like, two dogs entered a room, okay, here's a sentence.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.100]   And so, we're connecting two and dogs together, that's like, there's some dependency between
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.780]   those words to make some bigger meaning, and then we're connecting dogs now to entered,
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.860]   right?
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.620]   And we connect a room somehow to entered, and so I'm gonna connect to room and then
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.580]   room back to entered.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.060]   That's the tree, is I, the root is entered, that's, the thing is like an entering event,
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.740]   that's what we're saying here, and the subject, which is whatever that dog is, is two dogs,
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.380]   it was, and the connection goes back to dogs, which goes back to, then that goes back to
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.380]   two.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.780]   I'm just, that's my tree.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.300]   It starts at entered, goes to dogs, down to two, and then the other side, after the verb,
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.500]   the object, it goes to room, and then that goes back to the determiner or article, whatever
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   you want to call that word.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.780]   So, there's a bunch of categories of words here, we're noticing, so there are verbs,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.660]   those are these things that typically mark, they refer to events and states in the world,
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.660]   and there are nouns, which typically refer to people, places, and things, is what people
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.060]   say, but they can refer to other more, they can refer to events themselves as well.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:22.980]   They're marked by, you know, how they get, the category, the part of speech of a word
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.700]   is how it gets used in language.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.140]   It's like, that's how you decide what the category of a word is, not by the meaning,
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.580]   but how it gets used.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.580]   - How it's used.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.820]   What's usually the root, is it gonna be the verb that defines the event?
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.220]   - Usually, usually, yes, yes.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.220]   - Okay.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.380]   - Yeah, I mean, if I don't say a verb, then there won't be a verb, and so it'll be something
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.380]   else.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.300]   - What if you're messing, are we talking about language that's like, correct language?
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.020]   What if you're doing poetry and messing with stuff, is it, then rules go out the window,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.020]   right?
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.020]   Then it's--
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.020]   - No.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.020]   - You're still--
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.700]   - No, no, no, no, you're constrained by whatever language you're dealing with.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.900]   Probably you have other constraints in poetry, such that you're, like usually in poetry there's
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.820]   multiple constraints that you want to, like you want to usually convey multiple meanings
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.980]   is the idea, and maybe you have like a rhythm or a rhyming structure as well, and depending,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.660]   but you usually are constrained by your, the rules of your language for the most part,
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.620]   and so you don't violate those too much.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.300]   You can violate them somewhat, but not too much, so it has to be recognizable as your
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   language.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.500]   Like in English, I can't say, "Dogs two entered room a."
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:33.540]   I mean, I meant that, you know, two dogs entered a room, and I can't mess with the order of
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.420]   the articles, the articles and the nouns, you just can't do that.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.380]   In some languages, you can mess around with the order of words much more.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.900]   I mean, you speak Russian, Russian has a much freer word order than English, and so in fact
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.540]   you can move around words in, you know, I told you that English has a subject, verb,
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.320]   object, word order, so does Russian, but Russian is much freer than English, and so you can
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.740]   actually mess around with the word order, so probably Russian poetry is gonna be quite
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.820]   different from English poetry because the word order is much less constrained.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:10.540]   - Yeah, there's a much more extensive culture of poetry throughout the history of the last
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.780]   hundred years in Russia, and I always wondered why that is, but it seems that there's more
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.100]   flexibility in the way the language is used.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.340]   You're morphing the language easier by altering the words, altering the order of the words,
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.340]   messing with it.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.780]   - Well, you can just mess with different things in each language, and so in Russian, you have
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:35.820]   case markers, which are just these endings on the nouns which tell you how each noun
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.100]   connects to the verb, right?
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.820]   We don't have that in English, and so when I say Mary kissed John, I don't know who the
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.220]   agent or the patient is except by the order of the words, right?
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.820]   In Russian, you actually have a marker on the end if you're using a Russian name, and
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:55.660]   each of those names, you'll also say is it, you know, it'll be the nominative, which is
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.900]   marking the subject, or an accusative will mark the object.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.780]   And you could put them in the reverse order.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:07.340]   You could put accusative first, you could put subject, you could put the patient first,
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.660]   and then the verb, and then the subject, and that would be a perfectly good Russian sentence,
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:17.900]   and it would still mean, I could say John kissed Mary, meaning Mary kissed John, as
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.740]   long as I use the case markers in the right way.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.020]   You can't do that in English.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:27.940]   - I love the terminology of agent and patient, and the other ones you used, those are sort
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.320]   of linguistic terms, correct?
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.540]   - Those are, those are for, like, kind of meaning, those are meaning, and subject and
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.140]   object are generally used for position, so subject is just like the thing that comes
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.180]   before the verb, and the object is the one that comes after the verb.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.380]   The agent is kind of like the thing doing, that's kind of what that means, right?
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.500]   The subject is often the person doing the action, right, the thing, so yeah.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.780]   - Okay, this is fascinating.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.260]   So how hard is it to form a tree in general, is there a procedure to it, like if you look
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.140]   at different languages, is it supposed to be a very natural, like is it automatable,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.220]   or is there some human genius involved in constructing it?
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.820]   - I think it's pretty automatable at this point.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.860]   People can figure out what the words are, they can figure out the morphemes, which are
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.980]   the, technically, morphemes are the minimal meaning units within a language, okay?
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:16.300]   And so, when you say eats, or drinks, it actually has two morphemes in it in English, there's
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.540]   the root, which is the verb, and then there's some ending on it which tells you, you know,
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.340]   that's this third person, third person singular.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.860]   - Can you say what morphemes are?
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.060]   - Morphemes are just the minimal meaning units within a language, and a word is just, kind
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.940]   of the things we put spaces between in English, and they're a little bit more, they have the
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.140]   morphology as well, they have the endings, this inflectional morphology on the endings
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140]   on the roots.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.100]   - It modifies something about the word that adds additional meaning.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.300]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so we have a little bit of that in English, very little, much
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.340]   more in Russian, for instance, but we have a little bit in English, and so we have a
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.220]   little on the nouns, you can say it's either singular or plural, and you can say, same
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:58.100]   thing for verbs, like simple past tense, for example, it's like, you know, notice in English
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.860]   we say drinks, you know, he drinks, but everyone else is I drink, you drink, we drink, it's
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.420]   unmarked in a way, and then, but in the past tense, it's just drank, for everyone, there's
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.820]   no morphology at all for past tense.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.820]   There is morphology, it's marking past tense, but it's kind of, it's an irregular now, so
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.720]   we don't even, you know, drink to drank, you know, it's not even a regular word, so in
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.380]   most verbs, many verbs, there's an -ed, we kind of add, so walk to walked, we add that
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.480]   to say it's the past tense, that I just happened to choose an irregular, 'cause it's a high-frequency
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.380]   word, and the high-frequency words tend to have irregulars in English for.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.380]   - What's an irregular?
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.480]   - Irregular is just, there isn't a rule, so drink to drank, it's an irregular.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.260]   - Drink, drank, okay, versus walked.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.020]   - As opposed to walk, walked, talked, talked.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.420]   - And there's a lot of irregulars in English.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.180]   - There's a lot of irregulars in English.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.760]   The frequent ones, the common words, tend to be irregular, there's many, many more low-frequency
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.120]   words, and those tend to be, those are regular ones.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.240]   - The evolution of the irregulars are fascinating, 'cause it's essentially slang that's sticky,
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.960]   'cause you're breaking the rules, and then everybody uses it and doesn't follow the rules,
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.840]   and they say screw it to the rules, it's fascinating, so you said morphemes, lots of questions,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.040]   so morphology is what, the study of morphemes?
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.880]   - Morphemes is the connections between the morphemes onto the roots, the roots.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.840]   So in English, we mostly have suffixes, we have endings on the words, not very much,
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.000]   but a little bit, as opposed to prefixes.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.120]   Some words, depending on your language, can have mostly prefixes, mostly suffixes, or
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.840]   mostly, or both, and then even languages, several languages have things called infixes,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:41.760]   where you have some kind of a general form for the root, and you put stuff in the middle,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   you change the vowels.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:48.760]   - That's fascinating, that's fascinating, so in general, there's what, two morphemes
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   per word, usually one or two, or three?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.640]   - Well in English, it's one or two, in English, it tends to be one or two, there can be more.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.800]   In other languages, a language like Finnish, which has a very elaborate morphology, there
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.720]   may be 10 morphemes on the end of a root, and so there may be millions of forms of a
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   given word.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:18.800]   - Okay, I will ask the same question over and over, but how does, just sometimes to
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.560]   understand things like morphemes, it's nice to just ask the question, how do these kinds
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.480]   of things evolve?
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:35.320]   So you have a great book studying sort of the, how the cognitive processing, how language
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.360]   used for communication, so the mathematical notion of how effective language is for communication,
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:46.120]   what role that plays in the evolution of language, but just high level, like how do we, how does
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.520]   a language evolve with, where English is two morphemes, or one or two morphemes per word,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.760]   and then Finnish has infinity per word?
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   So what, how does that happen, is it just people?
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.600]   - That's a really good question.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:06.640]   That's a very good question, is why do languages have more morphology versus less morphology,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.520]   and I don't think we know the answer to this.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.440]   I think there's just a lot of good solutions to the problem of communication.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:22.080]   So I believe, as you hinted, that language is an invented system by humans for communicating
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.560]   their ideas, and I think it comes down to we label the things we want to talk about,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.320]   those are the morphemes and words, those are the things we want to talk about in the world,
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:36.120]   and we invent those things, and then we put them together in ways that are easy for us
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.120]   to convey, to process.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.960]   But that's like a naive view, and I don't, I mean, I think it's probably right, right?
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   It's naive and probably right, but--
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.640]   - One has to notice, I don't know if it's naive, I think it's simple.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   - Simple, yeah.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.760]   - Naive is an indication that it's incorrect somehow, it's a trivial, too simple, I think
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.720]   it could very well be correct.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.400]   But it's interesting how sticky, it feels like two people got together, it just feels
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.480]   like once you figure out certain aspects of a language, that just becomes sticky and the
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.800]   tribe forms around that language, or maybe the language, maybe the tribe forms first
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.560]   and then the language evolves, and then you just kind of agree and you stick to whatever
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   that is.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.720]   - These are very interesting questions, we don't know really about how words, even words,
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.640]   get invented very much about, we don't really, I mean, assuming they get invented, we don't
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.280]   really know how that process works and how these things evolve.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:39.760]   What we have is kind of a current picture, a current picture of a few thousand languages,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.960]   a few thousand instances.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   We don't have any pictures of really how these things are evolving, really.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:52.260]   And then the evolution is massively confused by contact, right?
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:58.640]   So as soon as one language group, one group runs into another, we are smart, humans are
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.780]   smart and they take on whatever is useful in the other group.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:08.480]   And so any kind of contrast which you're talking about, which I find useful, I'm gonna start
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   using as well.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:16.240]   And I worked a little bit in specific areas of words, in number words and in color words.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.760]   And in color words, so we have, in English, we have around 11 words that everyone knows
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.080]   for colors.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.520]   And many more, if you happen to be interested in color for some reason or other, if you're
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.800]   a fashion designer or an artist or something, you may have many, many more words.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.960]   But we can see millions, like if you have normal color vision, normal trichromatic color
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.560]   vision, you can see millions of distinctions in color.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.200]   So we don't have millions of words.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.240]   The most efficient, no, the most detailed color vocabulary would have over a million
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.280]   terms to distinguish all the different colors that we can see.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.760]   But of course we don't have that.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:26:01.560]   So it's somehow, it's kind of useful for English to have evolved in some way to, there's 11
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:08.920]   terms that people find useful to talk about, black, white, red, blue, green, yellow, purple,
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.440]   black, gray, pink, and I probably missed something there.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:17.960]   Anyway, there's 11 that everyone knows, but you go to different cultures, especially the
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.080]   non-industrialized cultures, and there'll be many fewer.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   So some cultures will have only two, believe it or not.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.400]   The Danai in Papua New Guinea have only two labels that the group uses for color.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.000]   Those are roughly black and white.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.800]   They are very, very dark and very, very light, which are roughly black and white.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.120]   And you might think, oh, they're dividing the whole color space into light and dark
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   or something.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   And that's not really true.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.040]   They mostly just only label the black and the white things.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.320]   They just don't talk about the colors for the other ones.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   And then there's other groups.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:56.920]   I worked with a group called the Chimani down in Bolivia in South America, and they have
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   three words that everyone knows, but there's a few others that several people, that many
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.160]   people know.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.120]   And so they have, kind of depending on how you count, between three and seven words that
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.840]   the group knows.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.120]   And again, they're black and white.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   Everyone knows those.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.120]   And red, red is, that tends to be the third word that everyone, that cultures bring in.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.480]   If there's a word, it's always red, the third one.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.560]   And then after that, it's kind of all bets are off about what they bring in.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.680]   And so after that, they bring in a sort of a big blue-green group.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.120]   They have one for that.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   And then different people have different words that they'll use for other parts of the space.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:45.680]   And so anyway, it's probably related to what they want to talk, not what they see, because
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.880]   they see the same colors as we see.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:54.320]   So it's not like they have a weak, a low color palette in the things they're looking at.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:01.600]   They're looking at a lot of beautiful scenery, a lot of different colored flowers and berries
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   and things.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.400]   And so there's lots of things of very bright colors, but they just don't label the color
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   in those cases.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.880]   And the reason, probably, we don't know this, but we think probably what's going on here
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.720]   is that what you do, why you label something, is you need to talk to someone else about
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   it.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.080]   And why do I need to talk about a color?
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.280]   Well, if I have two things which are identical, and I want you to give me the one that's different,
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.640]   and the only way it varies is color, then I invent a word which tells you, "This is
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   the one I want."
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.360]   So I want the red sweater off the rack, not the green sweater.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.040]   And so those things will be identical, because these are things we made, and they're dyed,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.680]   and there's nothing different about them.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:50.640]   And so in industrialized society, everything we've got is pretty much arbitrarily colored.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.520]   But if you go to a non-industrialized group, that's not true.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.480]   And so they don't, it's not only that they're not interested in color, if you bring bright
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.080]   colored things to them, they like them just like we like them.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   Bright colors are great, they're beautiful, but they just don't need to, no need to talk
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   about them.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   They don't have--
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.320]   - So probably color words is a good example of how language evolves from sort of function,
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.800]   when you need to communicate the use of something.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   - I think so.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.200]   - Then you kind of invent different variations, and basically, you can imagine that the evolution
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.680]   of a language has to do with what the early tribe's doing, like what kind of problems
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.720]   are facing them, and they're quickly figuring out how to efficiently communicate the solution
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.600]   to those problems, whether it's aesthetic or functional, all that kind of stuff, running
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   away from a mammoth or whatever.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.840]   But I think what you're pointing to is that we don't have data on the evolution of language,
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.160]   because many languages were formed a long time ago, so you don't get the chatter.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:56.120]   We have a little bit of old English to modern English, because there was a writing system,
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.680]   and we can see how old English looked.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.440]   So the word order changed, for instance, in old English to middle English to modern English,
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.080]   and so we can see things like that, but most languages don't even have a writing system.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.120]   So of the 7,000, only a small subset of those have a writing system, and even if they have
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.360]   a writing system, it's not a very modern writing system, and so they don't have it, so we just
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.880]   basically have, for Mandarin, for Chinese, we have a lot of evidence for a long time,
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.600]   and for English, and not for much else.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.240]   Not for German a little bit, but not for a whole lot of long-term language evolution.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   We don't have a lot.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.960]   We just have snapshots, is what we've got, of current languages.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.640]   - Yeah, you get an inkling of that from the rapid communication on certain platforms,
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   like on Reddit.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.200]   There's different communities, and they'll come up with different slang.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.400]   Especially from my perspective, German, by a little bit of humor, or maybe mockery or
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:57.040]   whatever, just talking shit in different kinds of ways, and you could see the evolution of
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.920]   language there, because I think a lot of things on the internet, you don't want to be the
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:11.960]   boring mainstream, so you want to deviate from the proper way of talking, and so you
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:18.240]   get a lot of deviation, rapid deviation, and then when communities collide, you get, just
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   like you said, humans adapt to it, and you can see it through the lens of humor.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.420]   It's very difficult to study, but you can imagine 100 years from now, if there's a new
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.000]   language born, for example, we'll get really high-resolution data.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.040]   - I mean, English is changing.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.100]   English changes all the time.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:40.680]   All languages change all the time, so there's the famous result about the Queen's English.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.520]   So if you look at the Queen's vowels, the Queen's English is supposed to be, originally
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.080]   the proper way for the talk was sort of defined by whoever the Queen talked, or the King,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:57.800]   whoever was in charge, and so if you look at how her vowels changed from when she first
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.040]   became Queen in 1952, '53, when she was coronated, I mean, that's Queen Elizabeth who died recently,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.240]   of course, until 50 years later, her vowels changed, her vowels shifted a lot.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:15.200]   And so even in the sounds of British English, in her, the way she was talking was changing.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.800]   The vowels were changing slightly.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.280]   So that's just, in the sounds, there's change.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.040]   I don't know what's, I'm interested, we're all interested in what's driving any of these
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   changes.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.400]   The word order of English changed a lot over 1,000 years, right?
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.880]   So it used to look like German, it used to be a verb-final language with case marking,
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.120]   and it shifted to a verb-medial language, a lot of contact, so a lot of contact with
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.600]   French, and it became a verb-medial language with no case marking.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.640]   And so it became this verb-initially thing.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.200]   And so that's-- - It's evolving.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.240]   - It totally evolved, and so it may very well, I mean, it doesn't evolve maybe very much
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.600]   in 20 years, is maybe what you're talking about, but over 50 and 100 years, things change
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   a lot, I think.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.040]   - We'll now have good data on it, which is great.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   - That's for sure, yeah.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.960]   - Can you talk to what is syntax and what is grammar?
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.920]   So you wrote a book on syntax.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   - I did.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.600]   You were asking me before about how do I figure out what a dependency structure is.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.760]   I'd say the dependency structures aren't that hard to, generally, I think there's a lot
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.600]   of agreement of what they are for almost any sentence in most languages.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.680]   I think people will agree on a lot of that.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.960]   There are other parameters in the mix such that some people think there's a more complicated
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.080]   grammar than just a dependency structure.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:36.760]   And so, you know, like Noam Chomsky, he's the most famous linguist ever, and he is famous
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.800]   for proposing a slightly more complicated syntax.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.720]   And so he invented phrase structure grammar.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:50.120]   So he's well-known for many, many things, but in the '50s and early '60s, but late '50s,
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.420]   he was basically figuring out what's called formal language theory.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:34:01.480]   And he figured out sort of a framework for figuring out how complicated a certain type
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.120]   of language might be, so-called phrase structure grammars of language might be.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:14.120]   And so his idea was that maybe we can think about the complexity of a language by how
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.160]   complicated the rules are, okay?
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.720]   And the rules will look like this.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.840]   They will have a left-hand side and they'll have a right-hand side.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.560]   And on the left-hand side, we'll expand to the thing on the right-hand side.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.640]   So say we'll start with an S, which is like the root, which is a sentence, okay?
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.240]   And then we're going to expand to things like a noun phrase and a verb phrase is what he
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.800]   would say, for instance, okay?
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.560]   An S goes to an NP and a VP is a kind of a phrase structure rule.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.280]   And then we figure out what an NP is.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.960]   An NP is a determiner and a noun, for instance, and a verb phrase is something else, is a
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.920]   verb and another noun phrase and another NP, for instance.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.280]   Those are the rules of a very simple phrase structure, okay?
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.120]   And so he proposed phrase structure grammar as a way to sort of cover human languages.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.080]   And then he actually figured out that, well, depending on the formalization of those grammars,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.280]   you might get more complicated or less complicated languages.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.480]   And so he said, well, these are things called context-free languages that rule.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.040]   He thought human languages would tend to be what he calls context-free languages.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   But there are simpler languages, which are so-called regular languages, and they have
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.840]   a more constrained form to the rules of the phrase structure of these particular rules.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:36.400]   So he basically discovered and kind of invented ways to describe the language, and those are
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.640]   phrase structure, a human language.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.280]   And he was mostly interested in English initially in his work in the '50s.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.600]   - So quick questions around all this.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.320]   So formal language theory is the big field of just studying language formally.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.440]   - Yes, and it doesn't have to be human language there.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:36:00.880]   We can have computer languages, any kind of system which is generating some set of expressions
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   in a language.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:08.280]   And those could be like the statements in a computer language, for example.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.240]   So it could be that or it could be human language.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.840]   - So technically you can study programming languages.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.680]   - Yes, and have been.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.480]   Heavily studied using this formalism.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.600]   There's a big field of programming languages within the formal language.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.960]   - Okay, and then phrase structure, grammar, is this idea that you can break down language
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.920]   into this S-N-P-V-P type of thing?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.760]   - It's a particular formalism for describing language.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.120]   And Chomsky was the first one.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   He's the one who figured that stuff out back in the '50s.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.720]   And that's equivalent, actually.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.080]   The context-free grammar is kind of equivalent in the sense that it generates the same sentences
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.400]   as a dependency grammar would.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.720]   The dependency grammar is a little simpler in some way.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.200]   You just have a root, and it goes, we don't have any of these.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.840]   The rules are implicit, I guess.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.440]   We just have connections between words.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.960]   The phrase structure grammar is kind of a different way to think about the dependency
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   grammar.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.720]   It's slightly more complicated, but it's kind of the same in some ways.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.840]   - So to clarify, dependency grammar is the framework under which you see language, and
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.160]   you make the case that this is a good way to describe language.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   - That's correct.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.920]   - And Noam Chomsky's watching.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.280]   This is very upset right now, so let's, just kidding.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:31.440]   But what's the difference between, where's the place of disagreement between phrase structure
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.480]   grammar and dependency grammar?
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   - They're very close.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.240]   So phrase structure grammar and dependency grammar aren't that far apart.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.500]   I like dependency grammar because it's more perspicuous.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.200]   It's more transparent about representing the connections between the words.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.100]   It's just a little harder to see in phrase structure grammar.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:55.320]   The place where Chomsky sort of devolved or went off from this is he also thought there
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.580]   was something called movement.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.220]   And that's where we disagree.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.440]   That's the place where I would say we disagree.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   And I mean, maybe we'll get into that later, but the idea is, if you wanna, do you want
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   me to explain that?
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.040]   - I would love, can you explain movement?
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   - Movement, okay, so Chomsky--
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.040]   - There's so many interesting things.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.020]   Okay, so here's the, movement is, Chomsky basically sees English and he says, okay,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:22.380]   I said, we had that sentence earlier, it was like two dogs entered the room, but it's changed
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.180]   a little bit, say, two dogs will enter the room.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:30.660]   And he notices that, hey, English, if I wanna make a question, a yes/no question from that
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.060]   same sentence, I say, instead of two dogs will enter the room, I say, will two dogs
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   enter the room?
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.780]   Okay, there's a different way to say the same idea, and it's like, well, the auxiliary verb
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.600]   that will thing, it's at the front as opposed to in the middle, okay?
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.660]   And so, and he looked, if you look at English, you see that that's true for all those modal
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.460]   verbs and for other kinds of auxiliary verbs in English, you always do that, you always
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:39:01.560]   put an auxiliary verb at the front, and when he saw that, so if I say, I can win this bet,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.580]   can I win this bet, right, so I move a can to the front.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.740]   So actually, that's a theory, I just gave you a theory there, he talks about it as movement,
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.540]   that word in the declarative is the root, is the sort of default way to think about
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.940]   the sentence, and you move the auxiliary verb to the front.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:23.260]   That's a movement theory, okay, and he just thought that was just so obvious that it must
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:28.660]   be true, that there's nothing more to say about that, that this is how auxiliary verbs
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.980]   work in English.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:35.080]   There's a movement rule, such that you move, like to get from the declarative to the interrogative,
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.060]   you're moving the auxiliary to the front, and it's a little more complicated as soon
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:45.100]   as you go to simple present and simple past, because if I say John slept, you have to say
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.900]   did John sleep, not slept John, right, and so you have to somehow get an auxiliary verb
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:54.660]   and I guess underlyingly, it's like slept, it's a little more complicated than that,
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.380]   but that's his idea, there's a movement, okay, and so a different way to think about that,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.580]   that isn't, I mean, then he ended up showing later, so he proposed this theory of grammar,
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.660]   which has movement, and there's other places where he thought there's movement, not just
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:14.340]   auxiliary verbs, but things like the passive in English and things like questions, WH questions,
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.220]   a bunch of places where he thought there's also movement going on, and in each one of
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:23.260]   those, he thinks there's words, well, phrases and words are moving around from one structure
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.300]   to another, which he called deep structure to surface structure, I mean, there's like
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.860]   two different structures in his theory, okay.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.540]   There's a different way to think about this, which is there's no movement at all, there's
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:41.380]   a lexical copying rule, such that the word will or the word can, these auxiliary verbs,
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.580]   they just have two forms, and one of them is the declarative and one of them is interrogative,
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:50.860]   and you basically have the declarative one, and oh, I form the interrogative, or I can
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.900]   form one from the other, doesn't matter which direction you go, and I just have a new entry,
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.820]   which has the same meaning, which has a slightly different argument structure, argument structure
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:07.540]   is just a fancy word for the ordering of the words, and so if I say, it was the dogs, two
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:16.220]   dogs can or will enter the room, there's two forms of will, one is will declarative, and
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.660]   then okay, I've got my subject to the left, it comes before me, and the verb comes after
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:25.940]   me in that one, and then the will interrogative, it's like, oh, I go first, interrogative,
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.860]   will is first, and then I have the subject immediately after, and then the verb after
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:35.020]   that, and so you can just generate from one of those words, another word with a slightly
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.820]   different argument structure, with different ordering.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.140]   - And these are just lexical copies, they're not necessarily moving from one to another.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.140]   - There's no movement.
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:48.940]   - There's a romantic notion that you have one main way to use a word, and then you could
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.820]   move it around, which is essentially what movement is implying.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.420]   - Yeah, but that's the lexical copying is similar, so then we do lexical copying for
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.100]   that same idea, that maybe the declarative is the source, and then we can copy it, and
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:08.740]   so an advantage, there's multiple advantages of the lexical copying story, it's not my
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:14.140]   story, this is like, Ivan Sog, linguists, a bunch of linguists have been proposing these
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:20.060]   stories as well, in tandem with the movement story, okay, Ivan Sog died a while ago, but
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.900]   he was one of the proponents of the non-movement of the lexical copying story, and so that
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:34.500]   is that, a great advantage is, well, Chomsky, really famously in 1971, showed that the movement
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:41.220]   story leads to learnability problems, it leads to problems for how language is learned, it's
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.940]   really, really hard to figure out what the underlying structure of a language is if you
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.380]   have both phrase structure and movement, it's like really hard to figure out what came from
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.460]   what, there's like a lot of possibilities there.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.220]   If you don't have that problem, the learning problem gets a lot easier.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:02.140]   - Just say there's lexical copies, and when we say the learning problem, do you mean humans
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   learning a new language?
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:09.220]   - Yeah, just learning English, so a baby is lying around listening to me talk, and how
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:13.940]   are they learning English, or maybe it's a two-year-old who's learning interrogatives
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:20.940]   and stuff, how are they doing that, are they doing it from, are they figuring out, so Chomsky
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:26.300]   said it's impossible to figure it out, actually, he said it's actually impossible, not hard,
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:31.220]   but impossible, and therefore, that's where universal grammar comes from, is that it has
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:37.140]   to be built in, and so what they're learning is, there's some built in, movement is built
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:44.380]   in in his story, it's absolutely part of your language module, and then you are, you're
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:48.340]   just setting parameters, you're said, depending on English, it's just sort of a variant of
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.940]   the universal grammar, and you're figuring out, oh, which orders does English do these
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:59.500]   things, that's, the non-movement story doesn't have this, it's like much more bottom up,
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:04.420]   you're learning rules, you're learning rules one by one, and oh, there's, this word is
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.880]   connected to that word, a great advantage, another advantage, it's learnable, another
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.300]   advantage of it is that it predicts that not all auxiliaries might move, like it might
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:19.140]   depend on the word, depending on whether you, and that turns out to be true, so there's
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:25.860]   words that don't really work as auxiliary, they work in declarative and not in interrogative,
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:32.820]   so I can say, I'll give you the opposite first, I can say, "Aren't I invited to the party?"
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:38.180]   And that's an interrogative form, but it's not from, "I aren't invited to the party,"
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.540]   there is no, "I aren't," so that's interrogative only.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:50.100]   And then we also have forms like, "Ought," "I ought to do this," and I guess some old
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.140]   British people can say, "Ought I?"
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.140]   Exactly.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.140]   It doesn't sound right, does it?
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.780]   For me, it sounds ridiculous.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.100]   I don't even think "ought" is great, but I mean, I totally recognize, "I ought to,"
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.020]   it's not too bad, actually, I can say, "I ought to do this," that sounds pretty good.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.020]   "Ought I?"
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.280]   If I'm trying to sound sophisticated, maybe.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.500]   I don't know, it just sounds completely out to me.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   "Ought I?"
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.100]   Anyway, so there are variants here, and a lot of these words just work in one versus
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:17.660]   the other, and that's fine under the lexical copying story, it's like, well, you just
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:23.780]   learn the usage, whatever the usage is, is what you do with this word.
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.700]   But it's a little bit harder in the movement story.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.460]   The movement story, that's an advantage, I think, of lexical copying, and in all these
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:37.860]   different places, there's all these usage variants which make the movement story a little
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.980]   bit harder to work.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.940]   So one of the main divisions here is the movement story versus the lexical copying story, that
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:49.580]   has to do about the auxiliary words and so on, but if you rewind to the phrase structured
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.540]   grammar versus dependency grammar.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.780]   Those are equivalent in some sense, in that for any dependency grammar, I can generate
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:03.220]   a phrase structured grammar which generates exactly the same sentences, I just like the
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:11.020]   dependency grammar formalism because it makes something really salient, which is the lengths
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.220]   of dependencies between words, which isn't so obvious in the phrase structure.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.640]   In the phrase structure, it's just kind of hard to see.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.060]   It's in there, it's just very, very, it's opaque.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:25.100]   - Technically, I think phrase structured grammar is mappable to dependency grammar.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.100]   - And vice versa.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.100]   - And vice versa.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.580]   - It's just like these little labels, SMPVP.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.220]   - Yeah, for a particular dependency grammar, you can make a phrase structured grammar which
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:39.340]   generates exactly those same sentences, and vice versa, but there are many phrase structured
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.980]   grammars which you can't really make a dependency grammar.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.460]   I mean, you can do a lot more in a phrase structured grammar, but you get many more
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.860]   of these extra nodes, basically.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:53.180]   You can have more structure in there, and some people like that, and maybe there's value
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   to that.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   I don't like it.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:01.020]   - Well, for you, so we should clarify, so dependency grammar, it's just, well, one word
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:07.220]   depends on only one other word, and you form these trees, and that makes, it really puts
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.660]   priority on those dependencies, just like as a tree that you can then measure the distance
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.140]   of the dependency from one word to the other.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:22.620]   They can then map to the cognitive processing of the sentences, how easy it is to understand,
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:31.220]   So, it just puts the focus on just like the mathematical distance of dependence between
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.220]   words.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.300]   So, like, it's just a different focus.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.460]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.420]   - Just continue on the thread of Chomsky, 'cause it's really interesting, 'cause as you're
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.440]   discussing disagreement, to the degree there's disagreement, you're also telling the history
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.220]   of the study of language, which is really awesome.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.660]   So, you mentioned context-free versus regular.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:54.420]   Does that distinction come into play for dependency grammars?
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   - No.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   - Okay.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.420]   - Not at all.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:02.540]   I mean, regular languages are too simple for human languages.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.380]   It's a part of the hierarchy.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:11.620]   But human languages are, in the phrase structure world, are definite, they're at least context-free.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.300]   Maybe a little bit more, a little bit harder than that.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:19.460]   So, there's something called context-sensitive as well, where you can have, like this is
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.860]   just the formal language description.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:28.140]   In a context-free grammar, you have one, this is like a bunch of formal language theory
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.140]   we're doing here.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.140]   - I love it.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.140]   - Okay.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.700]   So, you have a left-hand side category, and you're expanding to anything on the right.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.700]   That's a context-free.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.660]   So, the idea is that that category on the left expands in independent of context to
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.820]   those things, whatever they are on the right, doesn't matter what.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:50.140]   And a context-sensitive says, okay, I actually have more than one thing on the left.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.580]   I can tell you only in this context, maybe you have a left and a right context, or just
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.700]   a left context or a right context, I have two or more stuff on the left, tells you how
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.220]   to expand those things in that way.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.700]   Okay, so it's context-sensitive.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:09.540]   A regular language is just more constrained, and so it doesn't allow anything on the right.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:17.260]   It allows very, basically, it's one very complicated rule, is kind of what a regular language is.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:21.620]   And so, it doesn't have any, what's it say, long-distance dependencies?
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.300]   It doesn't allow recursion, for instance.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   There's no recursion.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.260]   Yeah, recursion is where you, which is, human languages have recursion, they have embedding,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.460]   and you can't, well, it doesn't allow center-embedded recursion, which human languages have, which
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:34.460]   is what--
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.460]   - Center-embedded recursion.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.460]   - We're gonna get to that.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.460]   - So, within a sentence, within a sentence.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.460]   - Yeah, within a sentence.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.460]   Yeah, we're gonna get to that.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.100]   But, you know, the formal language stuff is a little aside, Chomsky wasn't proposing it
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.500]   for human languages, even.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:49.380]   He was just pointing out that human languages are context-free, and then he was most, for
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.960]   human, 'cause that was kind of stuff we did for formal languages, and what he was most
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:50:00.120]   interested in was human language, and that's like, the movement is where we, where he sort
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.740]   of set off on, I would say, a very interesting, but wrong foot.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.040]   It was kind of interesting, it's a very, I agree, it's a very interesting history.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.640]   So there's this, so he proposed this multiple theories in '57 and then '65, they all have
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.020]   this framework, though, it was phrase structure plus movement, different versions of the phrase
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.180]   structure and the movement in the '57, these are the most famous original bits of Chomsky's
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.180]   work.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:27.540]   And then '71 is when he figured out that those lead to learning problems, that there's cases
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:34.980]   where a kid could never figure out which rule, which set of rules was intended.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:37.620]   And so, and then he said, well, that means it's innate.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.820]   It's kind of interesting, he just really thought the movement was just so obviously true that
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:47.180]   he couldn't, he didn't even entertain giving it up, it's just obvious, that's obviously
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.180]   right.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:53.500]   And it was later where people figured out that there's all these subtle ways in which
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:58.820]   things, which look like generalizations aren't generalizations, and they, across the category,
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.780]   they're word-specific, and they have, and they kind of work, but they don't work across
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.940]   various other words in the category, and so it's easier to just think of these things
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.820]   as lexical copies.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:13.220]   And I think he was very obsessed, I don't know, I'm guessing, that he just, he really
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.940]   wanted this story to be simple in some sense, and language is a little more complicated
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:18.940]   in some sense.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.940]   He didn't like words, he never talks about words, he likes to talk about combinations
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.940]   of words.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:28.900]   And words are, you know, look up a dictionary, there's 50 senses for a common word, right?
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.060]   The word "take" will have 30 or 40 senses in it.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.400]   So there'll be many different senses for common words.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.900]   And he just doesn't think about that, or he doesn't think that's language.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:45.760]   I think he doesn't think that's language, he thinks that words are distinct from combinations
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   of words.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   I think they're the same.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:54.180]   If you look at my brain in the scanner, while I'm listening to a language I understand,
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:59.320]   and you compare, I can localize my language network in a few minutes, in like 15 minutes.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.000]   And what you do is I listen to a language I know, I listen to, you know, maybe some
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:09.180]   language I don't know, or I listen to muffled speech, or I read sentences, and I read non-words,
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.140]   like I can do anything like this, anything that's sort of really like English, and anything
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.700]   that's not very like English.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.660]   So I've got something like it and not, and I've got a control.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:22.740]   And the voxels, which is just, you know, the 3D pixels in my brain that are responding
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:30.540]   most is a language area, and that's this left-lateralized area in my head.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:36.460]   And wherever I look in that network, if you look for the combinations versus the words,
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.460]   it's everywhere.
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.460]   It's the same.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.460]   It's the same.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.460]   That's fascinating.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.460]   And so it's like hard to find.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.940]   There are no areas that we know, I mean, that's, it's a little overstated right now.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.980]   At this point, the technology isn't great, it's not bad, but we have the best way to
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.860]   figure out what's going on in my brain when I'm listening or reading language is to use
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.780]   fMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:02.140]   And that's a very good localization method.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:06.460]   So I can figure out where exactly these signals are coming from, pretty, you know, down to,
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.400]   you know, millimeters, you know, cubic millimeters or smaller, okay?
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.400]   Very small.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   We can figure those out very well.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.940]   The problem is the when, okay?
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.420]   It's measuring oxygen, okay?
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:21.140]   And oxygen takes a little while to get to those cells, so it takes on the order of seconds.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.860]   So I talk fast, I probably listen fast, and I can probably understand things really fast.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.060]   So a lot of stuff happens in two seconds.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:34.620]   And so to say that we know what's going on, that the words, right now in that network,
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.820]   our best guess is that whole network is doing something similar, but maybe different parts
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.340]   of that network are doing different things.
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:43.900]   And that's probably the case.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.820]   We just don't have very good methods to figure that out, right, at this moment.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.500]   And so since we're kind of talking about the history of the study of language, what other
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.180]   interesting disagreements, and you're both at MIT, or were for a long time, what kind
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:03.860]   of interesting disagreements there, tension of ideas are there between you and Noam Chomsky?
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:10.660]   And we should say that Noam was in the linguistics department, and you're, I guess for a time
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:16.140]   were affiliated there, but primarily brain and cognitive science department, which is
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.940]   another way of studying language, and you've been talking about fMRI.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:25.700]   So what, is there something else interesting to bring to the surface about the disagreement
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.980]   between the two of you, or other people in the discipline?
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:35.180]   - Yeah, I mean, I've been at MIT for 31 years, since 1993, and he, Chomsky's been there much
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.860]   longer.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:42.580]   So I met him, I knew him, I met when I first got there, I guess, and we would interact
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.580]   every now and then.
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:52.300]   So I'd say our biggest difference is our methods, and so that's the biggest difference between
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:57.820]   me and Noam, is that I gather data from people.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:02.940]   I do experiments with people, and I gather corpus data, whatever corpus data's available,
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:08.900]   and we do quantitative methods to evaluate any kind of hypothesis we have.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:09.900]   He just doesn't do that.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:16.620]   And so, he has never once been associated with any experiment or corpus work, ever.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.600]   And so, it's all thought experiments.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.720]   It's his own intuitions, so I just don't think that's the way to do things.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:31.260]   That's a cross-the-street, they're-across-the-street-from-us kind of difference between brain and cog sci
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.260]   and linguistics.
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:37.020]   I mean, not all linguists, some of the linguists, depending on what you do, more speech-oriented,
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:43.100]   they do more quantitative stuff, but in the meaning, words and, well, it's combinations
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:49.420]   of words, syntax semantics, they tend not to do experiments and corpus analysis.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:56.020]   - So on the linguistic side, probably, well, but the method is a symptom of a bigger approach,
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:01.820]   which is sort of a psychology/philosophy side, and, Noam, for you, it's more sort of data-driven,
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.500]   sort of almost like a mathematical approach.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm a psychologist.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.500]   So I would say we're in psychology.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.060]   Brain and cognitive science is MIT's old psychology department.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:16.000]   It was a psychology department up until 1985, and it became the Brain and Cognitive Science
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Department.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.900]   And so, I mean, my training is math and computer science, but I'm a psychologist.
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.380]   I mean, I don't know what I am.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380]   - So data-driven psychologist.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.380]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.380]   - You are.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.540]   - I don't know what I am, but I'm happy to be called a linguist, I'm happy to be called
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.980]   a computer scientist, I'm happy to be called a psychologist, any of those things.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:39.660]   - In the actual, like how that manifests itself outside of the methodology is like these differences,
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.460]   these subtle differences about the movement story versus the lexical copy story.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.640]   - Yeah, those are theories, right?
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:51.980]   So the theories are, but I think the reason we differ in part is because of how we evaluate
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.980]   the theories.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.780]   And so I evaluate theories quantitatively, and Noam doesn't.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.380]   - Got it.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:04.420]   Okay, well, let's explore the theories that you explore in your book.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:10.140]   Let's return to this dependency grammar framework of looking at language.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:14.580]   What's a good justification why the dependency grammar framework is a good way to explain
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:15.580]   language?
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.800]   What's your intuition?
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.660]   - So the reason I like dependency grammar, as I've said before, is that it's very transparent
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:26.120]   about its representation of distance between words.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.980]   So it's like, all it is, is you've got a bunch of words, you're connecting together to make
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:39.100]   a sentence, and a really neat insight, which turns out to be true, is that the further
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.140]   apart the pair of words are that you're connecting, the harder it is to do the production, the
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.740]   harder it is to do the comprehension.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.500]   It's harder to produce, it's harder to understand when the words are far apart.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:51.900]   When they're close together, it's easy to produce and it's easy to comprehend.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.720]   Let me give you an example, okay?
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:58:00.840]   So we have, in any language, we have mostly local connections between words, but they're
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.840]   abstract.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.180]   The connections are abstract, they're between categories of words.
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:12.840]   And so you can always make things further apart if you add modification, for example,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   after a noun.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.320]   So a noun in English comes before a verb, the subject noun comes before a verb, and
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.120]   then there's an object after, for example.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.480]   I can say what I said before, you know, "The dog entered the room," or something like that.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.120]   So I can modify "dog."
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:32.280]   If I say something more about "dog" after it, then what I'm doing is, indirectly, I'm
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:37.100]   lengthening the dependence between "dog" and "entered" by adding more stuff to it.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.320]   So I just make it explicit here.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:50.400]   If I say, "The boy who the cat scratched cried," we're going to have a mean cat here.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.320]   And so what I've got here is, "The boy cried," it would be a very short, simple sentence,
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:59.960]   and I just told you something about the boy, and I told you it was the boy who the cat
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.240]   scratched, okay?
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:05.000]   So the "cried" is connected to the "boy," the "cried" at the end is connected to the
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   "boy" in the beginning.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Right.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   And so I can do that, and I can say that.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.860]   That's a perfectly fine English sentence.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:16.880]   And I can say, "The cat which the dog chased ran away," or something, okay?
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.920]   I can do that.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:23.960]   But it's really hard now, I've got, you know, whatever I have here, I have, "The boy who
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.080]   the cat"—now let's say I try to modify "cat," okay?
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:32.880]   "The boy who the cat which the dog chased scratched ran away."
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   Oh my God, that's hard, right?
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.960]   I'm sort of just working that through in my head, how to produce, and it's really just
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.600]   horrendous to understand.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   It's not so bad.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.480]   At least I've got intonation there to sort of mark the boundaries and stuff, but that's
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.160]   really complicated.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.480]   That's sort of English in a way.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.400]   I mean, that follows the rules of English.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.200]   So what's interesting about that is that what I'm doing is nesting dependencies there.
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.920]   I'm putting one—I've got a subject connected to a verb there, and then I'm modifying that
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.240]   with a clause, another clause, which happens to have a subject and a verb relation.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.120]   I'm trying to do that again on the second one.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:12.320]   And what that does is it lengthens out the dependence—multiple dependents actually
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   get lengthened out there.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.720]   So the dependencies get longer, and the outside ones get long, and even the ones in between
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.800]   get kind of long.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.760]   So what's fascinating is that that's bad.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.120]   That's really horrendous in English.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.200]   But that's horrendous in any language.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.680]   So no matter what language you look at, if you do—just figure out some structure where
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.640]   I'm going to have some modification following some head, which is connected to some later
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.040]   head, and I do it again, it won't be good.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]   Guaranteed.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.800]   So 100%, that will be uninterpretable in that language in the same way that was uninterpretable
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   in English.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.800]   - Let's just clarify.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:55.880]   The distance of the dependencies is whenever the boy cried, there's a dependence between
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.520]   two words, and then you're counting the number of, what, morphemes between them?
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520]   - That's a good question.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   I'll just say words.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.000]   Your words are morphemes between.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   We don't know that.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   Actually, that's a very good question.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.300]   What is the distance metric?
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.480]   But let's just say it's words, sure.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:15.080]   And you're saying the longer the distance of that dependence, the more—no matter the
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080]   language, except Ligali's—
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080]   - Even Ligali's.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.080]   - Even Ligali's.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080]   Okay, we'll talk about it.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080]   - We'll talk about it.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   - We'll get to that.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.240]   But that—the people will be very upset that speak that language.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.120]   Not upset, but they'll either not understand it, or they'll be like this is—their brain
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.040]   will be working in overtime.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.600]   - They will have a hard time either producing or comprehending it.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.020]   They might tell you that's not their language.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.020]   It's sort of their language.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.220]   I mean, it's following their—like, they'll agree with each of those pieces as part of
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:48.080]   their language, but somehow that combination will be very, very difficult to produce and
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   understand.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   - Is that a chicken or the egg issue here?
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.080]   So like, is—
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.240]   - Well, I'm giving you an explanation.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   - Right.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.040]   - So the—well, I mean—and then there's—I'm giving you two kinds of explanations.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.840]   I'm telling you that center embedding, that's nesting, those are the same—those are synonyms
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.980]   for the same concept here.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.760]   And the explanation for what—those are always hard.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.080]   Center embedding and nesting are always hard.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.580]   And I gave you an explanation for why they might be hard, which is long-distance connections.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.940]   When you do center embedding, when you do nesting, you always have long-distance connections
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.940]   between the dependents.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.880]   You just—and so that's not necessarily the right explanation, it just—I can go through
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.560]   reasons why that's probably a good explanation.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.240]   And it's not really just about one of them.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.200]   So probably it's a pair of them or something of these dependents that you—get long that
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.980]   drives you to like be really confused in that case.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:39.920]   And so what the behavioral consequence there—I mean, we—this is kind of methods.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.540]   Like how do we get at this?
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.600]   You could try to do experiments to get people to produce these things.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.160]   They're going to have a hard time producing them.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.800]   You can try to do experiments to get them to understand them and get—see how well
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.720]   they understand them, can they understand them.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.440]   Another method you can do is give people partial materials and ask them to complete them, you
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.360]   know, those center-embedded materials, and they'll fail.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.360]   So I've done that.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.360]   I've done these kinds of things.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.820]   - So, so, so, wait a minute.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.720]   So central embedding meaning, like you take a normal sentence like boy cried and inject
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.360]   a bunch of crap in the middle that separates the boy and the cried.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   Okay.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   That's central embedding.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.640]   And nesting is on top of that.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.120]   - No, no, nesting is the same thing.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.080]   Center-embedding, those are totally equivalent terms.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.160]   I'm sorry I sometimes use one and sometimes use the other.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.160]   - Ah, got it, got it.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   Totally equivalent.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   - They don't mean anything different.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   - Got it.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   And then what you're saying is there's a bunch of different kinds of experiments you can
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   do.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.600]   And the way to understand anyone is like have more embedding, more central embedding.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.320]   Is it easier or harder to understand?
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.600]   But then you have to measure the level of understanding, I guess.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.600]   - Yeah, yeah, you could.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.360]   I mean, there's multiple ways to do that.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.000]   I mean, there's the simplest way is just ask people how good does it sound?
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.220]   How natural does it sound?
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.400]   That's a very blunt but very good measure.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.820]   It's very, very reliable.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.240]   People will do the same thing.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.720]   And so it's like, I don't know what it means exactly, but it's doing something such that
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.000]   we're measuring something about the confusion, the difficulty associated with those.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.840]   - And those, like those are giving you a signal.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.760]   That's why you can say them.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.560]   What about the completion of the central embed?
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:13.800]   - So if you give them a partial sentence, say I say the book which the author who, and
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.600]   I ask you to now finish that off for me.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.680]   I mean, either say it, yeah, yeah, but say it's written in front of you and you can just
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.480]   type in, have as much time as you want.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.240]   They will, even though that one's not too hard, right?
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   So if I say it's like the book, it's like, oh, the book which the author who I met wrote
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   was good.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.840]   That's a very simple completion for that.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.280]   If I give that completion online somewhere to a crowdsourcing platform and ask people
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.640]   to complete that, they will miss off a verb very regularly, like half the time, maybe
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   two thirds of the time.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.520]   They'll say, they'll just leave off one of those verb phrases.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:58.960]   Even with that simple, so say the book which the author who, and they'll say was, you need
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960]   three verbs, right?
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.080]   Three verbs are who I met, wrote, was good.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   And they'll give me two.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.880]   They'll say, who was famous, was good, or something like that.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.400]   They'll just give me two.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.360]   And that'll happen about 60% of the time.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.600]   So 40%, maybe 30, they'll do it correctly, correctly, meaning they'll do a three verb
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600]   phrase.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   I don't know what's correct or not.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   This is hard.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   It's a hard task.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   - Yeah, I can actually, I'm struggling with it in my head.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.360]   - Well, it's easier written.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360]   - When you stare at it.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.200]   - If you look, it's a little easier than listening, it's pretty tough.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.320]   'Cause you have to, 'cause there's no trace of it.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.640]   You have to remember the words that I'm saying, which is very hard auditorily.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.640]   We wouldn't do it this way.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.640]   You do it written.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.840]   You can look at it and figure it out.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.680]   It's easier in many dimensions in some ways, depending on the person.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:47.400]   It's easier to gather written data for, I mean, most sort of, I work in psycholinguistics,
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   right?
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   Psychology of language and stuff.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.740]   And so a lot of our work is based on written stuff because it's so easy to gather data
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.240]   from people doing written kinds of tasks.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.480]   Written tasks are just more complicated to administer and analyze because people do weird
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.880]   things when they speak, and it's harder to analyze what they do.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.080]   But they generally point to the same kinds of things.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:19.320]   - Okay, so the universal theory of language by Ted Gibson is that you can form dependency,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.920]   you can form trees from any sentences, and you can measure the distance in some way of
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.760]   those dependencies, and then you can say that most languages have very short dependencies.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   - All languages.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760]   - All languages.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   - All languages have short dependencies.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.880]   You can actually measure that.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.680]   So an ex-student of mine, this guy's at University of California, Irvine, Richard Futrell did
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.720]   a thing a bunch of years ago now, where he looked at all the languages we could look
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:50.640]   at, which was about 40 initially, and now I think there's about 60, for which there
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.760]   are dependency structures.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.120]   So meaning there's gotta be a big text, a bunch of texts, which have been parsed for
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.840]   the dependency structures, and there's about 60 of those which have been parsed that way.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:09.720]   And for all of those, what he did was take any sentence in one of those languages, and
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.360]   you can do the dependency structure, and then start at the root, we're talking about dependency
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.080]   structures, that's pretty easy now, and he's trying to figure out what a control way you
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.280]   might say the same sentence is in that language.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:26.360]   And so he's just like, all right, there's a root, and let's say the sentence is, let's
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.160]   go back to two dogs entered the room.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:35.440]   So entered is the root, and entered has two dependents, it's got dogs, and it has room.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.280]   And what he does is, let's scramble that order, that's three things, the root, and the head,
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.400]   and the two dependents, in just some random order, just random, and then just do that
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.000]   for all the dependents down the tree.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.480]   So now look, do it for the, and whatever, it's two, and dogs, and for, and room.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.120]   And that's not, it's a very short sentence, when sentences get longer, and you have more
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:00.800]   dependents, there's more scrambling that's possible, and what he found, so that's one,
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.000]   you can figure out one scrambling for that sentence, he did this like a hundred times,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.880]   for every sentence in every one of these texts, every corpus, and then he just compared the
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.640]   dependency lengths in those random scramblings to what actually happened, what the English
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.480]   or the French or the German was in the original language, or Chinese, or what all these like
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.960]   80, no, 60 languages, okay?
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.400]   And the dependency lengths are always shorter in the real language, compared to this kind
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   of a control.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:36.120]   And there's another, it's a little more rigid, his control, so the way I described it, you
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:41.440]   could have crossed dependencies, like by scrambling that way, you could scramble in any way at
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   all, languages don't do that, they tend not to cross dependencies very much.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.240]   Like so the dependency structure, they tend to keep things non-crossed, and there's a
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.720]   technical term, they call that projective, but it's just non-crossed is all that is projective.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.680]   And so if you just constrain the scrambling, so that it only gives you projective, sort
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.320]   of non-crossed, the same thing holds.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.720]   So still human languages are much shorter than this kind of a control.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.400]   So there's like, what it means is that we're, in every language, we're trying to put things
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.920]   close relative to this kind of a control.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.720]   It doesn't matter about the word order, some of these are verb-final, some of these are
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.800]   verb-medial-like English, and some are even verb-initial, there are a few languages in
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.080]   the world which have VSO, word order, verb, subject, object languages, haven't talked
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.000]   about those, it's like 10% of the...
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.640]   - And even in those languages, it's still short dependencies.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.080]   - Short dependencies is rules.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.120]   - Okay, so what are some possible explanations for that?
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.160]   For why languages have evolved that way?
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:53.240]   So that's one of the, I suppose, disagreements you might have with Chomsky, so you consider
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:10:02.680]   the evolution of language in terms of information theory, and for you, the purpose of language
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.040]   is ease of communication, right, and processing.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.280]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.520]   So I mean, the story here is just about communication, it is just about production, really, it's
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.600]   about ease of production, is the story.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.120]   - When you say production, can you--
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.360]   - Oh, I just mean ease of language production, it's easier for me to say things when the,
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.240]   what I'm doing whenever I'm talking to you is somehow I'm formulating some idea in my
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.840]   head and I'm putting these words together, and it's easier for me to do that, to put,
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.600]   to say something where the words are closely connected in a dependency, as opposed to separated,
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.600]   by putting something in between and over and over again, it's just hard for me to keep
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.880]   that in my head, that's the whole story, the story, it's basically, the dependency grammar
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.440]   sort of gives that to you, just like long is bad, short is good, it's easier to keep
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.660]   in mind because you have to keep it in mind for, probably for production, probably matters
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.160]   in comprehension as well, also matters in comprehension.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.400]   - It's on both sides, the production and the--
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.040]   - But I would guess it's probably evolved for production, it's about producing, what's
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:09.800]   easier for me to say, that ends up being easier for you also, that's very hard to disentangle,
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.160]   this idea of who is it for, is it for me, the speaker, or is it for you, the listener,
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.320]   I mean part of my language is for you, like the way I talk to you is gonna be different
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:24.600]   from how I talk to different people, I'm definitely angling what I'm saying to who I'm saying,
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.920]   it's not like I'm just talking the same way to every single person, and so I am sensitive
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:37.480]   to my audience, but does that work itself out in the dependency length differences,
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.280]   I don't know, maybe that's about just the words, that part, which words I select.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:48.320]   - My initial intuition is that you optimize language for the audience, but it's just kind
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.440]   of like messing with my head a little bit to say that some of the optimization might
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.400]   be, maybe the primary objective of the optimization might be the ease of production.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:03.920]   - We have different senses I guess, I'm very selfish, and you're like, I think it's all
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.520]   about me, I'm just doing what's easiest for me, I don't wanna, I mean but I have to of
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.200]   course choose the words that I think you're gonna know, I'm not gonna choose words you
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:20.280]   don't know, in fact I'm gonna fix that, so there it's about, but maybe for the syntax,
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.040]   for the combinations it's just about me, I feel like it's, I don't know though, it's
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.920]   very hard to-- - Wait, wait, wait, but the purpose of communication is to be understood,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.680]   is to convince others and so on, so like the selfish thing is to be understood, so it's
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.000]   about the listener. - Okay, it's a little circular there too
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.200]   then, okay. - Right, I mean like the ease of production--
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.320]   - Helps me be understood then, I don't think it's circular, so I want what's--
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:49.400]   - No I think the primary objective is about the listener, 'cause otherwise if you're optimizing
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.320]   for the ease of production then you're not gonna have any of the interesting complexity
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.120]   of language, like you're trying to like explain-- - Well let's control for what it is I want
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.880]   to say, like I'm saying let's control for the thing, the message, control for the message,
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.280]   I want to tell you-- - But that means the message needs to be
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.440]   understood, that's the goal. - Oh but that's the meaning, so I'm still
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.920]   talking about the form, just the form of the meaning, how do I frame the form of the meaning
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.040]   is all I'm talking about, you're talking about a harder thing I think, it's like how am I,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:21.200]   like trying to change the meaning, let's keep the meaning constant, like which, if you keep
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.360]   the meaning constant, how can I phrase whatever it is I need to say, like I gotta pick the
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.920]   right words and I'm gonna pick the order so that it's easy for me, that's what I think
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.040]   it's probably like. - I think I'm still tying meaning and form
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:40.320]   together in my head, but you're saying if you keep the meaning of what you're saying
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:46.120]   constant, the optimization, yeah it could be the primary objective that optimization
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:54.120]   is for production, that's interesting. I'm struggling to keep constant meaning, it's
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:14:02.440]   just so, I mean I'm a human, so for me the form, without having introspected on this,
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:09.680]   the form and the meaning are tied together, like deeply, because I'm a human, like for
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.800]   me when I'm speaking, 'cause I haven't thought about language, like in a rigorous way, about
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:22.360]   the form of language. - But look, for any event, there's an unbounded,
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.760]   I don't wanna say infinite, but sort of ways that I might communicate that same event.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.360]   This two dogs entered a room, I can say in many, many different ways, I can say hey,
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:37.120]   there's two dogs, they entered the room. Hey, the room was entered by something, the thing
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.960]   that was entered was two dogs, I mean that's kind of awkward and weird and stuff, but those
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:48.040]   are all similar messages with different forms, different ways I might frame, and of course
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.960]   I use the same words there all the time. I could have referred to the dogs as a Dalmatian
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.760]   and a poodle or something. I could have been more specific or less specific about what
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:02.520]   they are, and I could have said, been more abstract about the number. So I'm trying to
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:08.280]   keep the meaning, which is this event, constant, and then how am I gonna describe that to get
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.360]   that to you, it kind of depends on what you need to know, right, and what I think you
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.680]   need to know, but I'm like trying to, let's control for all that stuff, and not, and I'm
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.800]   just choosing, I'm doing something simpler than you're doing, which is just forms, just
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.960]   words. - So to you, specifying the breed of dog
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.320]   and whether they're cute or not is changing the meaning.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.840]   - That might be, yeah, yeah, that would be changing, oh, that would be changing the meaning
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.640]   for sure. - Right, so you're just, well, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.600]   That's changing the meaning, but say, even if we keep that constant, we can still talk
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.000]   about what's easier or hard for me, right, the listener and the, right? Which phrase
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.080]   structures I use, which combinations, which, you know.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   - This is so fascinating and just like a really powerful window into human language, but I
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:03.480]   wonder still throughout this how vast the gap between meaning and form. I just have
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:09.120]   this like maybe romanticized notion that they're close together, that they evolve close, like
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:15.880]   hand in hand, that you can't just simply optimize for one without the other being in the room
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:21.920]   with us. Like it's, well, it's kind of like an iceberg. Form is the tip of the iceberg
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.120]   and the rest, the meaning is the iceberg, but you can't like separate.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.640]   - But I think that's why these large language models are so successful is 'cause they're
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.960]   good at form and form isn't that hard in some sense. And meaning is tough still and that's
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.120]   why they're not, you know, they don't understand what they're doing. We're gonna talk about
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.920]   that later maybe, but like we can distinguish in our, forget about large language models,
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.200]   like humans, maybe you'll talk about that later too, is like the difference between
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.440]   language, which is a communication system, and thinking, which is meaning. So language
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.760]   is a communication system for the meaning, it's not the meaning. And so that's why, I
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.560]   mean, and there's a lot of interesting evidence we can talk about relevant to that.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.800]   - Well, I mean, that's a really interesting question. What is the difference between language,
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:19.040]   written, communicated, versus thought? What to use the difference between them?
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.640]   - Well, you or anyone has to think of a task, which they think is a good thinking task.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.320]   And there's lots and lots of tasks, which should be good thinking tasks. And whatever
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.160]   those tasks are, let's say it's, you know, playing chess, or that's a good thinking
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:39.640]   task, or playing some game, or doing some complex puzzles, maybe remembering some digits,
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.160]   that's thinking, remembering some, a lot of different tasks we might think, maybe just
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.520]   listening to music is thinking, or there's a lot of different tasks we might think of
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.640]   as thinking. There's this woman in my department, F. Fedorenko, and she's done a lot of work
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:56.680]   on this question about what's the connection between language and thought. And so she uses,
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:02.860]   I was referring earlier to MRI, fMRI, that's her primary method. And so she has been really
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:08.600]   fascinated by this question about whether, what language is. And so, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:13.920]   you can localize my language area, your language area, in a few minutes. In like 15 minutes
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:18.760]   I can listen to language, listen to non-language, or backward speech, or something, and we'll
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.640]   find areas, left lateralized network in my head, which is specially, which is very sensitive
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.080]   to language, as opposed to whatever that control was, okay?
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.880]   - Can you specify what you mean by language, like communicated language? Like what is language?
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.680]   - Just sentences. You know, I'm listening to English of any kind, a story, or I can
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.720]   read sentences, anything at all that I understand, if I understand it, then it'll activate my
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.720]   language network.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.720]   - In a stable way.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.960]   - My language network is going like crazy when I'm talking, and when I'm listening to
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.120]   you, because we're both, we're communicating.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.480]   - And that's pretty stable.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.400]   - Yeah, it's incredibly stable. So I've, I happen to be married to this woman at Federico,
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.680]   and so I've been scanned by her over, and over, and over, since 2007, or six, or something.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:04.480]   And so my language network is exactly the same, you know, like a month ago, as it was
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480]   back in 2007.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.480]   - Oh, wow.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.720]   - It's amazingly stable, it's astounding. It's a really fundamentally cool thing. And
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.720]   so my language network is, it's like my face, okay? It's not changing much over time, inside
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:17.720]   my head.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:22.280]   - Can I ask a quick question? Sorry, this is a small tangent. At which point in the,
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.000]   as you grow up from baby to adult, does it stabilize?
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   - We don't know.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   - We don't know.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.560]   - That's a very hard question. They're working on that right now, because of the problem
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.520]   scanning little kids. Like doing the, trying to do local, trying to do the localization
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.280]   on little children in this scanner. You're lying in the fMRI scan, that's the best way
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.680]   to figure out where something's going on inside our brains. And the scanner's loud, and you're
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.360]   in this tiny little area, you're claustrophobic. And it doesn't bother me at all, I can go
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.520]   to sleep in there. But some people are bothered by it, and little kids don't really like it,
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.760]   and they don't like to lie still. And you have to be really still, because if you move
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.160]   around, that messes up the coordinates of where everything is. And so, you know, try
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:07.440]   to get, you know, your question is, how and when are language developing, you know, how
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.480]   does this left lateralized system come to play? And it's really hard to get a two year
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.600]   old to do this task. But you can maybe, they're starting to get three and four and five year
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.960]   olds to do this task for short periods, and it looks like it's there pretty early.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:26.120]   - So clearly, when you lead up to a baby's first words, before that, there's a lot of
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:32.720]   fascinating turmoil going on about figuring out, what are these people saying? And you're
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.960]   trying to make sense, how does that connect to the world, and all that kind of stuff.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.760]   That might be just fascinating development that's happening there. That's hard to introspect.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.640]   - But anyway, we're back to the scanner. And I can find my network in 15 minutes, and now
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:53.080]   we can ask, find my network, find yours, find, you know, 20 other people do this task. And
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.880]   we can do some other tasks. Anything else you think is thinking of some other thing.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:03.920]   I can do a spatial memory task. I can do a music perception task. I can do programming
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:10.080]   task, if I program, okay? I can do, where I can understand computer programs. And none
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.320]   of those tasks tap the language network at all. Like, at all. There's no overlap. They're
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:20.880]   highly activated in other parts of the brain. There's a bilateral network, which I think
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.360]   she tends to call the multiple demands network, which does anything kind of hard. And so anything
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.480]   that's kind of difficult in some ways will activate that multiple demands network. I
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:36.560]   mean, music will be in some music area. You know, there's music-specific kinds of areas.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.440]   But none of them are activating the language area at all, unless there's words. Like, so
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.640]   if you have music, and there's a song, and you can hear the words, then you get the language
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   area.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.520]   - Are we talking about speaking and listening? Or are we also talking about reading?
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.840]   - This is all comprehension of any kind.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.680]   - That is fascinating.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:00.720]   - So this network doesn't make any difference if it's written or spoken. So the thing that
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.160]   she calls, Federico calls, the language network is this high-level language. So it's not about
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.240]   the spoken language, and it's not about the written language. It's about either one of
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.840]   them. And so when you do speech, you either listen to speech, and you subtract away some
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:20.760]   language you don't understand, or you subtract away backward speech, which sounds like speech,
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:26.680]   but it isn't. And then so you take away the sound part altogether. And then if you do
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:32.040]   written, you get exactly the same network. So for just reading the language versus reading
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.280]   sort of nonsense words or something like that, you'll find exactly the same network. And
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.560]   so this is about high-level comprehension of language, yeah, in this case. And the same
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.280]   thing happens, production's a little harder to run the scanner, but the same thing happens
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.320]   in production. You get the same network. So production's a little harder, right? You have
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.920]   to figure out how do you run a task in the network such that you're doing some kind of
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.360]   production. And I can't remember what, they've done a bunch of different kinds of tasks there
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.720]   where you get people to produce things, yeah, figure out how to produce. And the same network
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.600]   goes on there. It's actually the same place. - Wait, wait, so if you read random words?
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.480]   - Yeah, if you read things like-- - Like gibberish.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:12.600]   - Yeah, yeah, Lewis Carroll's twas brillig, jabberwocky, right? They call that jabberwocky
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.760]   speech. - The network doesn't get activated.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.880]   - Not as much. There are words in there. - Yeah, 'cause it's still--
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.600]   - There's function words and stuff, so it's lower activation.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.440]   - Fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So there's like,
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.000]   basically, the more language-like it is, the higher it goes in the language network. And
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.560]   that network is there from when you speak, as soon as you learn language. And it's there,
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.640]   like you speak multiple languages, the same network is going for your multiple languages.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:43.000]   So you speak English, you speak Russian, both of them are hitting that same network if you're
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.080]   fluent in those languages. - So programming--
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.520]   - Not at all. Isn't that amazing? Even if you're a really good programmer, that is not a human
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.480]   language. It's just not conveying the same information. And so it is not in the language
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.240]   network. - That is mind-blowing,
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.600]   as I think. That's weird. - It's pretty cool.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.880]   - That's weird. - It is amazing.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.800]   - That's really weird. - And so that's like one set of data.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:07.080]   This is hers, shows that what you might think is thinking is not language. Language is just
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:14.600]   this conventionalized system that we've worked out in human languages. Oh, another fascinating
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:21.560]   little tidbit is that even if there are these constructed languages like Klingon, or I don't
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.600]   know the languages from Game of Thrones, I'm sorry, I don't remember those languages.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.200]   - There's a lot of people offended right now. - There's people that speak those languages.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:34.040]   They really speak those languages because the people that wrote the languages for the shows,
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:40.840]   they did an amazing job of constructing something like a human language. And that lights up the
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:46.840]   language area. Because they can speak pretty much arbitrary thoughts in a human language.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.560]   It's a constructed human language, and probably it's related to human languages because the people
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.040]   that were constructing them were making them like human languages in various ways. But it also
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.400]   activates the same network, which is pretty cool. Anyway.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.760]   - Sorry to go into a place where you may be a little bit philosophical, but is it possible
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.960]   that this area of the brain is doing some kind of translation into a deeper set of
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.760]   almost like concepts? - It has to be doing.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.960]   So it's doing in communication, right? It is translating from thought, whatever that is,
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.920]   it's more abstract, and it's doing that. That's what it's doing. That is kind of what it is doing.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.240]   It's kind of a meaning network, I guess. - Yeah, like a translation network. But I
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.800]   wonder what is at the core, at the bottom of it, what are thoughts? Are thoughts,
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:41.960]   to me like thoughts and words, are they neighbors, or is it one turtle sitting on top of the other?
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:46.280]   Meaning like, is there a deep set of concepts that we--
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.240]   - Well, there's connections between what these things mean, and then there's probably other
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.360]   parts of the brain that what these things mean. And so when I'm talking about whatever it is I
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.400]   want to talk about, it'll be represented somewhere else. That knowledge of whatever that is will be
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.840]   represented somewhere else. - Well, I wonder if there's some stable,
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:14.200]   nicely compressed encoding of meanings that's separate from language. I guess the implication
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:21.720]   here is that we don't think in language. - That's correct. Isn't that cool? And that's
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.680]   so interesting. So people, I mean, this is like hard to do experiments on, but there is this idea
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:32.360]   of inner voice, and a lot of people have an inner voice. And so if you do a poll on the internet and
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.720]   ask if you hear yourself talking when you're just thinking or whatever, about 70 or 80% of people
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:44.280]   will say yes. Most people have an inner voice. I don't. And so I always find this strange. So when
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:50.360]   people talk about an inner voice, I always thought this was a metaphor, and they hear. I know most of
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.240]   you, whoever's listening to this, thinks I'm crazy now 'cause I don't have an inner voice, and I just
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.000]   don't know what you're listening to. It sounds so kind of annoying to me to have this voice going on
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.760]   while you're thinking, but I guess most people have that, and I don't have that, and we don't
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.280]   really know what that connects to. - I wonder if the inner voice activates
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.280]   that same network. I wonder. - I don't know. I don't know. I mean,
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.720]   this could be speechy, right? So that's like, you hear. Do you have an inner voice?
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.280]   - I don't think so. - Oh. A lot of people have
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:25.960]   this sense that they hear themselves, and then say they read someone's email. I've heard people tell
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:31.640]   me that they hear that other person's voice when they read other people's emails, and I'm like,
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.520]   wow, that sounds so disruptive. - I do think I vocalize what I'm reading,
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.800]   but I don't think I hear a voice. - Well, you probably don't have
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.840]   an inner voice. - Yeah, I don't think I have an inner voice.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:46.600]   - People have an inner voice. People have this strong percept of hearing sound in their heads
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.000]   when they're just thinking. - I refuse to believe
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.320]   that's the majority of people. - Majority, absolutely.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.320]   - What? - It's like two-thirds or
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.600]   three-quarters. It's a lot. - What?
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.280]   - I would never ask class, and when I go on the internet, they always say that.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.320]   So you're in a minority. - It could be a self-report flaw.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.480]   - It could be. - You know, when I'm reading
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:12.120]   inside my head, I'm kind of like saying the words, which is probably the wrong way to read,
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:19.400]   but I don't hear a voice. There's no percept of a voice. I refuse to believe the majority
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.560]   people have it. Anyway, it's a fascinating, the human brain is fascinating, but it still blew
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:31.240]   my mind that language does appear, comprehension does appear to be separate from thinking.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:39.160]   - Mm-hmm, so that's one set. One set of data from Fedorenko's group is that no matter what task you
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:43.800]   do, if it doesn't have words and combinations of words in it, then it won't light up the language
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.320]   network. It'll be active somewhere else, but not there. So that's one. And then this other
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:56.680]   piece of evidence relevant to that question is it turns out there are this group of people who've
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:02.520]   had a massive stroke on the left side and wiped out their language network. And as long as they
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.280]   didn't wipe out everything on the right as well, in that case, they wouldn't be cognitively
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.160]   functionable. But if they just wiped out language, which is pretty tough to do because it's very
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:17.240]   expansive on the left, but if they have, then there is patients like this, so-called global
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:24.760]   aphasics, who can do any task just fine, but not language. They can't talk to them. I mean,
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:31.240]   they don't understand you. They can't speak, can't write, they can't read, but they can play chess,
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:36.520]   they can drive their cars, they can do all kinds of other stuff, do math. So math is not in the
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.680]   language area, for instance. You do arithmetic and stuff, that's not language area. It's got
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.440]   symbols. So people sort of confuse some kind of symbolic processing with language, and symbolic
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.400]   processing is not the same. So there are symbols and they have meaning, but it's not language. It's
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:55.720]   not a conventionalized language system. And so math isn't there. And so they can do math. They
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:01.080]   do just as well as their age-matched controls and all these tasks. This is Rosemary Varley over in
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.320]   University College London, who has a bunch of patients who she's shown this, that they're just,
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:14.040]   so that sort of combination suggests that language isn't necessary for thinking. It doesn't mean you
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.640]   can't think in language. You could think in language, 'cause language allows a lot of
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:22.280]   expression, but it's just, you don't need it for thinking. It suggests that language is separate,
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.920]   is a separate system. - This is kind of blowing
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.040]   my mind right now. - It's cool, isn't it?
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:32.120]   - I'm trying to load that in, because it has implications for large language models.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.280]   - It sure does, and they've been working on that.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:39.320]   - Well, let's take a stroll there. You wrote that the best current theories of human language are
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.760]   arguably large language models. So this has to do with form.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:49.720]   - It's kind of a big theory, but the reason it's arguably the best is that it does the best at
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:55.800]   predicting what's English, for instance. It's incredibly good, better than any other theory.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:31:00.760]   It's so, but we don't, it's not sort of, there's not enough detail.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.960]   - Well, it's opaque. You don't know what's going on.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.640]   - You don't know what's going on. It's another black box. But I think it is a theory.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:13.640]   - What's your definition of a theory? 'Cause it's a gigantic black box with a very large
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:19.960]   number of parameters controlling it. To me, theory usually requires a simplicity, right?
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.920]   - Well, I don't know. Maybe I'm just being loose there. I think it's not a great theory,
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:28.760]   but it's a theory. It's a good theory in one sense, in that it covers all the data.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:33.080]   Like anything you want to say in English, it does. And so that's how it's arguably the best,
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:38.440]   is that no other theory is as good as a large language model in predicting exactly what's good
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:43.800]   and what's bad in English. Now you're saying, is it a good theory? Well, probably not, you know,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.920]   because I want a smaller theory than that. It's too big. I agree.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:53.400]   - You could probably construct a mechanism by which it can generate a simple explanation
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:32:01.400]   of a particular language, like a set of rules. It could generate a dependency
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.240]   grammar for a language, right? - Yes.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:14.520]   - You could probably just ask it about itself. - Well, you know, that presumes,
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:20.680]   and there's some evidence for this, that some large language models are implementing something
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:25.560]   like dependency grammar inside them. And so there's work from a guy called Chris Manning
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:31.960]   and colleagues over at Stanford in natural language. And they looked at, I don't know
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:38.120]   how many large language model types, but certainly BERT and some others, where you do some kind of
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.320]   fancy math to figure out exactly what kind of abstractions of representations are going on.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:49.160]   And they were saying, it does look like dependency structure is what they're constructing. So it's
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:55.960]   actually a very, very good map. So they are constructing something like that. Does it mean
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.360]   that they're using that for meaning? I mean, probably, but we don't know.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:05.000]   - You write that the kinds of theories of language that LLMs are closest to
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.160]   are called construction-based theories. Can you explain what construction-based theories are?
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:15.240]   - It's just a general theory of language such that there's a form and a meaning pair
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:21.720]   for lots of pieces of the language. And so it's primarily usage-based, is the construction
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:27.480]   grammar. It's trying to deal with the things that people actually say, actually say and actually
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:33.720]   write. And so it's a usage-based idea. And what's a construction? A construction is either a simple
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:38.600]   word, so like a morpheme plus its meaning, or a combination of words. It's basically
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:49.560]   combinations of words, like the rules. But it's unspecified as to what the form of the grammar
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:56.760]   is underlyingly. And so I would argue that the dependency grammar is maybe the right form to use
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:03.480]   for the types of construction grammar. Construction grammar typically isn't kind of formalized quite.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:08.760]   And so maybe the formalization, a-formalization of that, it might be in dependency grammar.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.520]   I mean, I would think so. But I mean, it's up to people, other researchers in that area,
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.160]   if they agree or not. - Do you think
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:23.720]   that large language models understand language? Are they mimicking language? I guess the deeper
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:29.720]   question there is, are they just understanding the surface form? Or do they understand something
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:35.160]   deeper about the meaning that then generates the form? - I mean, I would argue they're doing the
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.440]   form. They're doing the form, they're doing it really, really well. And are they doing the
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:44.120]   meaning? No, probably not. I mean, there's lots of these examples from various groups showing that
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:48.440]   they can be tricked in all kinds of ways. They really don't understand the meaning of what's
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:55.400]   going on. And so there's a lot of examples that he and other groups have given, which show they
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.440]   don't really understand what's going on. So you know the Monty Hall problem is this silly problem,
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:06.040]   right? Where if you have three door, it's let's make a deal, it's this old game show,
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:12.680]   and there's three doors, and there's a prize behind one, and there's some junk prizes behind
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:18.760]   the other two, and you're trying to select one. And if you, he knows, Monty, he knows where the
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.360]   target item is, the good thing, he knows everything is back there. And you're supposed to, he gives
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.040]   you a choice, you choose one of the three, and then he opens one of the doors, and it's some
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.360]   junk prize. And then the question is, should you trade to get the other one? And the answer is yes,
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.440]   you should trade, because he knew which ones you could turn around, and so now the odds are two
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:41.720]   thirds, okay? And then if you just change that a little bit to the large language model, the large
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:47.560]   language model has seen that explanation so many times that it just, if you change the story, it's
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.720]   a little bit, but it makes it sound like it's the Monty Hall problem, but it's not. You just say,
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:57.400]   "Oh, there's three doors, and one behind them is a good prize, and there's two bad doors. I happen
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.800]   to know it's behind door number one. The good prize, the car, is behind door number one. So,
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.560]   I'm going to choose door number one. Monty Hall opens door number three and shows me nothing
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.560]   there. Should I trade for door number two, even though I know the good prize is in door number
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.960]   one?" And then the large language model will say, "Yes, you should trade," because it just goes
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:20.920]   through the forms that it's seen before so many times on these cases, where it's, "Yes, you should
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.640]   trade, because your odds have shifted from one and three now to two out of three to being that thing."
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:31.800]   It doesn't have any way to remember that actually you have 100% probability behind that door number
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:37.160]   one. You know that. That's not part of the scheme that it's seen hundreds and hundreds of times
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:43.080]   before. Even if you try to explain to it that it's wrong, that it can't do that, it'll just keep
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:48.200]   giving you back the problem. - But it's also possible the large language model will be aware
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:54.920]   of the fact that there's sometimes over-representation of a particular kind of formulation.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.880]   And it's easy to get tricked by that. So you could see if they get larger and larger,
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:08.040]   models be a little bit more skeptical. So you see over-representation. So it just feels like
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:17.880]   training on form can go really far in terms of being able to generate
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:28.200]   things that look like the thing understands deeply the underlying world model of the kind of
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:36.600]   mathematical world, physical world, psychological world that would generate these kinds of sentences.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:42.600]   It just feels like you're creeping close to the meaning part. Easily fooled, all this kind of
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:51.320]   stuff. But that's humans too. So it just seems really impressive how often it seems like it
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:58.120]   understands concepts. - I mean, you don't have to convince me of that. I am very, very impressed.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:05.480]   I mean, you're giving a possible world where maybe someone's going to train some other versions such
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:11.880]   that it'll be somehow abstracting away from types of forms. I mean, I don't think that's happened.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.640]   - Well, no, no, no. I'm not saying that. I think when you just look at anecdotal examples
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.680]   and just showing a large number of them where it doesn't seem to understand and it's easily fooled,
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:32.360]   that does not seem like a scientific data-driven analysis of how many places is damn impressive
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.560]   in terms of meaning and understanding and how many places is easily fooled.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.760]   - That's not the inference. So I don't want to make that. The inference I wouldn't want to make
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.120]   was that inference. The inference I'm trying to push is just that is it like humans here? It's
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.920]   probably not like humans here. It's different. So humans don't make that error. If you explain that
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:55.320]   to them, they're not going to make that error. They don't make that error. And so it's doing
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:00.360]   something different from humans that they're doing in that case. - Well, what's the mechanism by which
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:04.840]   humans figure out that it's an error? - I'm just saying the error there is like, if I explain to
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:11.240]   you there's a 100% chance that the car is behind this door, well, do you want to trade? People say
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:17.480]   no. But this thing will say yes because it's so, that trick, it's so wound up on the form
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:22.840]   that it's, that's an error that a human doesn't make, which is kind of interesting.
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.640]   - Less likely to make, I should say. - Yeah, less likely.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.440]   - Because like humans are very. - Oh yeah.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.200]   - I mean, you're asking, you know, you're asking humans to, you're asking a system to understand
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:40.600]   100%, like you're asking some mathematical concepts. And so like. - Look, the places
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.840]   where large language models are, the form is amazing. So let's go back to nested structures,
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.920]   center-embedded structures, okay? If you ask a human to complete those, they can't do it.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.960]   Neither can a large language model. They're just like humans in that. If you ask, if I ask a large
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.440]   language model. - That's fascinating, by the way. The
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.400]   central embedding, the central embedding is, it struggles with.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:06.360]   - Just like humans, exactly like humans. Exactly the same way as humans. And that's not trained.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:13.400]   So they do exactly, so that is a similarity. So but then it's, that's not meaning, right? This
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.960]   is form. But when we get into meaning, this is where they get kind of messed up, where you start
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:22.920]   to saying, oh, what's behind this door? Oh, it's, you know, this is the thing I want. Humans don't
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:31.160]   mess that up as much. Here, the form is just like, the form matches amazing, similar, without being
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.840]   trained to do that. I mean, it's trained in the sense that it's getting lots of data, which is
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:41.720]   just like human data, but it's not being trained on bad sentences and being told what's bad. It
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:46.760]   just can't do those. It'll actually say things like, those are too hard for me to complete,
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.120]   or something, which is kind of interesting, actually. How does it know that? I don't know.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:58.280]   Oh, but it really often doesn't just complete sentences. It very often says stuff that's true,
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.840]   and sometimes says stuff that's not true. And almost always the form is great.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:12.440]   But it's still very surprising that with really great form, it's able to generate a lot of things
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:19.800]   that are true, based on what it's trained on and so on. So it's not just form that is
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:28.040]   generating. It's mimicking true statements from the internet. I guess the underlying idea there
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.160]   is that on the internet, truth is overrepresented versus falsehoods.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.840]   Yeah, I think that's probably right, yeah.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.240]   So, but the fundamental thing it's trained on, you're saying, is just form.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.160]   I think so, yeah. Yeah, I think so.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:47.320]   Well, that's a sad... To me, that's still a little bit of an open question. I probably lean
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:54.440]   agreeing with you, especially now you've just blown my mind that there's a separate module
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:42:00.680]   in the brain for language versus thinking. Maybe there's a fundamental part missing from
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.840]   the large language model approach that lacks the thinking, the reasoning capability.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:13.800]   Yeah, that's what this group argues. So the same group, Fedorenko's group,
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:20.360]   has a recent paper arguing exactly that. There's a guy called Kyle Mahowell, who's here in Austin,
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.000]   Texas, actually. He's an old student of mine, but he's a faculty in linguistics at Texas,
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.200]   and he was the first author on that.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.440]   That's fascinating. Still, to me, an open question.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.920]   What to you are the interesting limits of LLMs?
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:38.920]   You know, I don't see any limits to their form. Their form is perfect.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:39.480]   Impressive.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's pretty much... I mean, it's close to...
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.920]   Well, you said ability to complete central embeddings.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.560]   Yeah, it's just the same as humans. It seems the same.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.080]   But that's not perfect, right? It should be able to...
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.400]   That's good. No, but I want it to be like humans. I want a model of humans.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.080]   Oh, wait, wait, wait. Oh, so perfect is as close to humans as possible. I got it.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:42:59.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:03.160]   But you should be able to, if you're not human, like you're superhuman,
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.880]   you should be able to complete central embedded sentences, right?
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.840]   I mean, that's the mechanism. If it's modeling something,
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.320]   I think it's kind of really interesting that it can't...
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.120]   That it's really interesting.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.240]   That it's more like... I think it's potentially
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.560]   underlyingly modeling something like the way the form is processed.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.600]   The form of human language.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.400]   Yeah, the way that...
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.960]   And how humans process the language.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.800]   Yes, yes. I think that's plausible.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.400]   And how they generate language. Process language and generate language, that's fascinating.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:31.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:34.040]   So in that sense, they're perfect.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:40.040]   If we can just linger on the center embedding thing, that's hard for LLMs to produce,
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.400]   and that seems really impressive because that's hard for humans to produce.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:48.520]   And how does that connect to the thing we've been talking about before,
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.920]   which is the dependency grammar framework in which you view language,
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:58.120]   and the finding that short dependencies seem to be a universal part of language.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.960]   So why is it hard to complete center embeddings?
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:05.480]   So what I like about dependency grammar is it makes
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:14.360]   the cognitive cost associated with longer distance connections very transparent.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.480]   Turns out there is a cost associated with producing and comprehending
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:23.320]   connections between words which are just not beside each other.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.160]   The further apart they are, the worse it is, according to...
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.520]   Well, we can measure that.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.200]   And there is a cost associated with that.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:33.960]   Can you just linger on what do you mean by cognitive cost?
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.200]   Sure.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:34.840]   And how do you measure it?
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:36.760]   Oh, well, you can measure it in a lot of ways.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.280]   The simplest is just asking people to say how good a sentence sounds.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.320]   We just ask.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.360]   That's one way to measure.
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.920]   And you can try to triangulate then across sentences and across structures
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.840]   to try to figure out what the source of that is.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:56.040]   You can look at reading times in controlled materials.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.320]   In certain kinds of materials, and then we can measure the dependency distances there.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.320]   There's a recent study which looked at...
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.120]   We're talking about the brain here.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.960]   We could look at the language network, okay?
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.240]   We could look at the language network and we could look at the activation
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.480]   in the language network and how big the activation is depending on
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.920]   the length of the dependencies.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.720]   And it turns out in just random sentences that you're listening to,
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.440]   if you're listening to...
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.280]   So it turns out there are people listening to stories here.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.080]   And the bigger...
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:33.400]   The longer the dependency is, the stronger the activation in the language network.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.240]   And so there's some measure.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.240]   There's a bunch of different measures we could do.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.880]   That's kind of a neat measure, actually, of actual...
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:40.760]   - Activations.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.880]   - Activation in the brain.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.920]   - So you can somehow, in different ways, convert it to a number.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:47.880]   I wonder if there's a beautiful equation connecting cognitive costs
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.240]   and length of dependency.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.920]   E equals MC squared kind of thing.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.040]   - Yeah, it's complicated, but probably it's doable.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.480]   I would guess it's doable.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:00.360]   I tried to do that a while ago and I was reasonably successful,
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.200]   but for some reason I stopped working on that.
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.600]   I agree with you that it would be nice to figure out...
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.400]   So there's some way to figure out the cost.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.680]   I mean, it's complicated.
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:12.120]   Another issue you raised before was how do you measure distance?
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:12.840]   Is it words?
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.960]   It probably isn't part of the problem.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:22.040]   Is that some words matter more than others, and probably meaning nouns
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.080]   might matter, and then it maybe depends on which kind of noun.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.440]   Is it a noun we've already introduced or a noun that's already been mentioned?
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.960]   Is it a pronoun versus a name?
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.280]   All these things probably matter.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:34.120]   So probably the simplest thing to do is just like,
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.200]   "Oh, let's forget about all that and just think about words or morphemes."
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.160]   - For sure.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:47.480]   But there might be some insight in the kind of function that fits the data,
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:49.320]   meaning like a quadratic, like what...
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.480]   - I think it's an exponential.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:51.720]   - Exponential.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.560]   - So we think it's probably an exponential such that the longer the distance,
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.080]   the less it matters.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.440]   And so then it's the sum of those is my...
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.120]   That was our best guess a while ago.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.560]   So you've got a bunch of dependencies.
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.680]   If you've got a bunch of them that are being connected at some point,
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:13.240]   that's at the ends of those, the cost is some exponential function of those is my guess.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:18.200]   But because the reason it's probably an exponential is like it's not just the distance
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.960]   between two words because I can make a very, very long subject verb dependency
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.400]   by adding lots and lots of noun phrases and prepositional phrases,
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.240]   and it doesn't matter too much.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.040]   It's when you do nested, when I have multiple of these,
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:34.360]   then things go really bad, go south.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.920]   - Probably somehow connected to working memory or something like this.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:40.760]   - Yeah, that's probably a function of the memory here is the access,
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.640]   is trying to find those earlier things.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:47.320]   It's kind of hard to figure out what was referred to earlier.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.280]   Those are those connections.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.960]   That's the sort of notion of merking, as opposed to a storagy thing,
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:57.480]   but trying to connect, retrieve those earlier words depending on what was in between.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.240]   And then we're talking about interference of similar things in between.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.200]   That's the right theory probably has that kind of notion,
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.280]   and it is an interference of similar.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.000]   And so I'm dealing with an abstraction over the right theory,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.600]   which is just, you know, let's count words.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.120]   It's not right, but it's close.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.800]   And then maybe you're right though, there's some sort of an exponential
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.280]   or something to figure out the total,
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:22.920]   so we can figure out a function for any given sentence in any given language.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.640]   But you know, it's funny, people haven't done that too much,
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.560]   which I do think is, I'm interested that you find that interesting.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:30.760]   I really find that interesting,
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.600]   and a lot of people haven't found it interesting.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.480]   And I don't know why I haven't got people to want to work on that.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:36.440]   I really like that too.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.120]   - No, that's a beautified, and the underlying idea is beautiful,
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:43.400]   that there's a cognitive cost that correlates with the length of dependency.
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.440]   It feels like, I mean, language is so fundamental to the human experience,
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:55.560]   and this is a nice, clean theory of language where it's like, wow, okay,
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:00.200]   so we like our words close together, dependent words close together.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.800]   - Yeah, that's why I like it too.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.600]   It's so simple.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.000]   - Yeah, the simplicity of the theory, yeah.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.160]   - It's so simple, and yet it explains some very complicated phenomena.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.640]   If I write these very complicated sentences,
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:11.400]   it's kind of hard to know why they're so hard,
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:13.320]   and you can like, oh, nail it down.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.960]   I can give you a math formula for why each one of them is bad and where,
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.160]   and that's kind of cool.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.120]   I think that's very neat.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.480]   - Have you gone through the process?
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.560]   Is there like, if you take a piece of text and then simplify,
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.720]   sort of like there's an average length of dependency,
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:35.320]   and then you like, you know, reduce it and see comprehension on the entire,
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.480]   not just single sentence, but like, you know,
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.040]   you go from James Joyce to Hemingway or something.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.880]   - No, no, simple answer is no.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.760]   That does, there's probably things you can do in that kind of direction.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:47.480]   - That's fun.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.760]   - We might, you know, we're gonna talk about legalese at some point,
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.400]   so maybe we'll talk about that kind of thinking with applied to legalese.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:58.040]   - Well, let's talk about legalese, 'cause you mentioned that as an exception.
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.880]   We're just taking it tangent upon tangent.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.760]   That's an interesting one.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.360]   You give it as an exception.
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:03.480]   - It's an exception.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.840]   - That you say that most natural languages, as we've been talking about,
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.440]   have local dependencies, with one exception, legalese.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.080]   - That's right.
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:15.160]   - So what is legalese, first of all?
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:18.520]   - Oh, well, legalese is what you think it is.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:19.880]   It's just any legal language.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.440]   - Well, I mean, like, I actually know very little
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.120]   about the kind of language that lawyers use.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.280]   - So I'm just talking about language in laws and language in contracts.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:28.680]   - Got it.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.520]   - So the stuff that you have to run into,
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:34.040]   we have to run into every other day or every day,
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:38.280]   and you skip over because it reads poorly.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:40.760]   And, or, you know, partly it's just long, right?
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.480]   There's a lot of text there that we don't really want to know about.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.200]   And so, but the thing I'm interested in,
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.960]   so I've been working with this guy called Eric Martinez,
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.560]   who is a, he was a lawyer who was taking my class.
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.800]   I was teaching a psycholinguistics lab class,
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.640]   and I have been teaching it for a long time at MIT,
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:00.120]   and he's a, he was a law student at Harvard.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.400]   And he took the class 'cause he had done some linguistics as an undergrad,
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:09.320]   and he was interested in the problem of why legalese sounds hard to understand.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.880]   You know, why, and so why is it hard to understand,
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.320]   and why do they write that way if it is so hard to understand?
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:17.320]   It seems apparent that it's hard to understand.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.760]   The question is, why is it?
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.280]   And so we didn't know.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:24.760]   And we did an evaluation of a bunch of contracts.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.640]   Actually, we just took a bunch of sort of random contracts,
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:29.240]   'cause I don't know, you know, there's,
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:31.400]   contracts in laws might not be exactly the same,
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.720]   but contracts are kind of the things
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:36.040]   that most people have to deal with most of the time.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.680]   And so that's kind of the most common thing that humans have,
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.000]   like humans, that adults in our industrialized society
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.200]   have to deal with a lot.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.520]   And so that's what we polled.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.520]   And we didn't know what was hard about them,
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:53.320]   but it turns out that the way they're written is very center-embedded,
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.600]   has nested structures in them.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.920]   So it has low-frequency words as well.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:57.800]   That's not surprising.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.000]   Lots of texts have low,
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.200]   it does have surprising, slightly lower-frequency words
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.520]   than other kinds of control texts,
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.200]   even sort of academic texts.
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.720]   Legalese is even worse.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.880]   It is the worst that we were able to find.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.680]   - This is fascinating.
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.840]   You just revealed a game that lawyers are playing.
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:13.400]   - They're not, though.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.080]   - They're optimizing a different, well...
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:15.880]   - You know, it's interesting.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:17.720]   That's a, now you're getting at why.
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:18.920]   And so, and I don't think,
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.760]   so now you're saying it's, they're doing it intentionally.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.960]   I don't think they're doing it intentionally.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.480]   But let's, let's, let's get to this.
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:24.920]   - It's an emergent phenomena, okay.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get to that.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:26.920]   We'll get to that.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.760]   And so, but we wanted to see why.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.520]   So we see what first, as opposed,
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.840]   so like, 'cause it turns out that we're not the first
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.200]   to observe that legalese is weird.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:40.040]   Like, back to, Nixon had a plain language act in 1970,
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.480]   and Obama had one.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:44.280]   And boy, a lot of these, you know,
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:45.640]   a lot of presidents have said,
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.520]   "Oh, we've got to simplify legal language, must simplify it."
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.760]   But if you don't know how it's complicated,
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.040]   it's not easy to simplify it.
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.960]   You need to know what it is you're supposed to do
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:55.480]   before you can fix it, right?
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.400]   And so you need to like, you need a psycholinguist
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:00.680]   to analyze the text and see what's wrong with it
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.040]   before you can like, fix it.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:02.840]   You don't know how to fix it.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.960]   How am I supposed to fix something?
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.400]   I don't know what's wrong with it.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:07.080]   And so what we did was just, that's what we did.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.280]   We figured out, well, that's okay.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:09.880]   We just took a bunch of contracts, had people,
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:14.600]   and we encoded them for a bunch of features.
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:15.800]   And so another feature of the people,
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:17.240]   one of them was central embedding.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:23.240]   And so that is like, basically how often a clause
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:26.200]   would intervene between a subject and a verb.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.360]   For example, that's one kind of a central embedding
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:29.480]   of a clause, okay?
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:32.440]   And turns out they're massively central embedded.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:35.720]   Like, so I think in random contracts and in random laws,
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.480]   I think you get about 70% or 80, something like 70%
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.480]   of sentences have a central embedded clause in them,
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.400]   which is insanely high.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.680]   If you go to any other text, it's down to 20% or something.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:50.280]   It's so much higher than any control you can think of,
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.880]   including you think, oh, people think,
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.280]   oh, technical, academic texts.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:56.600]   No, people don't write central embedded sentences
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.120]   in technical, academic texts.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.720]   I mean, they do a little bit, but much,
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:03.080]   it's on the 20%, 30% realm, as opposed to 70.
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:05.720]   And so there's that, and there's low-frequency words.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.800]   And then people, oh, maybe it's passive.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:09.000]   People don't like the passive.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.480]   Passive, for some reason, the passive voice in English
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.160]   has a bad rap, and I'm not really sure
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.200]   where that comes from.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:19.160]   And there is a lot of passive in the,
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.600]   there's much more passive voice in legalese
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.120]   than there is in other texts. - And the passive voice
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.720]   accounts for some of the low-frequency words.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.040]   - No, no, no, no, those are separate, those are separate.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.920]   - Oh, so passive voice sucks, low-frequency word sucks.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:31.960]   - Well, sucks is different.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.480]   - That's a judgment on passive.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:35.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, drop the judgment.
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.120]   It's just like, these are frequent.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:38.200]   These are things which happen in legalese text.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:38.920]   Then we can ask.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.760]   The dependent measure is how well you understand
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.840]   those things with those features, okay?
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.360]   And so then, and it turns out the passive
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.240]   makes no difference.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:50.200]   So it has zero effect on your comprehension ability,
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.360]   on your recall ability, nothing at all.
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:53.240]   It has no effect.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.880]   The words matter a little bit.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.960]   They do, and low-frequency words are gonna hurt you
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.480]   in recall and understanding.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.600]   But what really hurts is the center embedding.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:03.560]   That kills you.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.640]   That is like, that slows people down.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:08.920]   That makes them very poor at understanding.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.800]   That makes them, they can't recall what was said
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:12.760]   as well, nearly as well.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:14.680]   And we did this not only on laypeople.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:16.040]   We did it on a lot of laypeople.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.560]   We ran it on 100 lawyers.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.840]   We recruited lawyers from a wide range
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:25.800]   of sort of different levels of law firms and stuff.
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.880]   And they have the same pattern.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.160]   So they also, like when they did this,
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.040]   I did not know what happened.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:33.720]   I thought maybe they could process.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:34.840]   They're used to legalese.
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.320]   They didn't process it just as well as it was normal.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:41.240]   No, no, they're much better than laypeople.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:44.200]   So they can much better recall, much better understanding,
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:45.720]   but they have the same main effects
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.280]   as laypeople, exactly the same.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.400]   So they also much prefer the non-center.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.880]   So we constructed non-center embedded versions
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.600]   of each of these.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.680]   We constructed versions which have higher frequency words
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:55:59.480]   in those places.
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:02.360]   And we did, we un-passivized.
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.200]   We turned them into active versions.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.360]   The passive active made no difference.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.280]   The words made little difference.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.240]   And the un-center embedding makes big differences
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:12.280]   in all the populations.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.640]   - Un-center embedding.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:14.920]   How hard is that process, by the way?
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.240]   - It's not very hard.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.280]   - For societies, don't question.
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:18.760]   But how hard is it to detect center embedding?
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:20.280]   - Oh, easy, easy to detect.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:21.960]   - You're just looking at long dependencies?
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.720]   - Yeah, yeah, you can just, you can.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.640]   So there's automatic parsers for English,
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:26.440]   which are pretty good.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.040]   - And they can detect center embedding?
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:28.760]   - Oh, yeah, very.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:30.040]   - Or, I guess, nesting.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.200]   - Perfectly, yeah, pretty much.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:34.280]   - So you're not just looking for long dependencies.
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:35.880]   You're just literally looking for center embedding.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.480]   - Yeah, yeah, we are in this case, in these cases.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.800]   But long dependencies, they're highly correlated.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.160]   - So like a center embedding is a big bomb
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.040]   you throw inside of a sentence that just blows up the,
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.000]   that makes, super.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:47.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.560]   Can I read a sentence for you from these things?
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:49.560]   - Sure.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.280]   - I mean, this is just like one of the things that,
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:52.840]   this is just terrible.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.480]   - My eyes might glaze over in mid-sentence.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:58.040]   No, I understand that.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.800]   I mean, legalese is hard.
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.040]   - So here we go.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:00.600]   This is a good one.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.920]   It goes, "In the event that any payment or benefit
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.240]   by the company, all such payments and benefits,
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.440]   including the payments and benefits
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.400]   under Section 3A hereof, being here and after
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:10.920]   referred to as a total payment,
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.160]   would be subject to the excise tax,
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.320]   then the cash severance payments shall be reduced."
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:17.800]   So that's something we pulled from a regular text,
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:18.760]   from a contract.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:19.400]   - Wow.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.480]   - And the center embedded bit there is just,
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:23.400]   for some reason, there's a definition.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:28.120]   They throw the definition of what payments and benefits are
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:29.720]   in between the subject and the verb.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.240]   Let's, how about don't do that?
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:31.560]   - Yeah.
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.560]   - How about put the definition somewhere else,
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.880]   as opposed to in the middle of the sentence?
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.360]   And so that's very, very common, by the way.
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:39.480]   That's what happens.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.240]   You just throw your definitions.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.160]   You use a word, a couple of words,
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.440]   and then you define it.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:46.360]   And then you continue the sentence.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:47.800]   Like, just don't write like that.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.400]   And you ask, so then we asked lawyers.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:51.080]   We thought, "Oh, maybe lawyers like this."
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:51.960]   Lawyers don't like this.
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.800]   They don't like this.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.480]   They don't wanna write like this.
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:58.440]   We asked them to rate materials
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.880]   which are with the same meaning,
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:02.440]   with un-centerbed and centerbed,
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:05.000]   and they much preferred the un-centerbed versions.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.920]   - On the comprehension, on the reading side.
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.040]   - Yeah, and we asked them, "Would you hire someone
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:11.000]   who writes like this or this?"
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.360]   We asked them all kinds of questions,
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.560]   and they always preferred the less complicated version,
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:16.120]   all of them.
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:18.120]   So I don't even think they want it this way.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.480]   - Yeah, but how did it happen?
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:20.040]   - How did it happen?
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:21.160]   That's a very good question.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:23.400]   And the answer is, we still don't know.
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.040]   But-- - I have some theories.
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:28.600]   - Well, our best theory at the moment is
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:33.080]   that there's actually some kind of a performative meaning
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.400]   in the center embedding, in the style,
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:37.000]   which tells you it's legalese.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.520]   We think that that's the kind of a style
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:40.120]   which tells you it's legalese.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:43.560]   Like, that's a reasonable guess, and maybe it's just...
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:45.080]   So, for instance, if you're...
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.480]   Like, it's like a magic spell.
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.880]   So we kind of call this the magic spell hypothesis.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:53.240]   So when you tell someone to put a magic spell on someone,
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:53.740]   what do you do?
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:56.680]   You know, people know what a magic spell is,
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.440]   and they do a lot of rhyming.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.440]   You know, that's kind of what people will tend to do.
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:02.280]   They'll do rhyming, and they'll do sort of like
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:03.560]   some kind of poetry kind of thing.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.760]   - Abracadabra type of thing.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:05.320]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.960]   And maybe there's a syntactic sort of reflex here
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:12.760]   of a magic spell, which is center embedding.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.160]   And so that's like, oh, it's trying to tell you
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:17.560]   this is something which is true,
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.960]   which is what the goal of law is, right?
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:22.840]   It's telling you something that we want you to believe
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:24.280]   as certainly true, right?
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:27.080]   That's what legal contracts are trying to enforce on you.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:31.400]   And so maybe that's like a form which has...
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:34.040]   This is like a very abstract form, center embedding,
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:36.360]   which has a meaning associated with it.
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:39.720]   - Well, don't you think there's an incentive
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:44.840]   for lawyers to generate things that are hard to understand?
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.760]   - That was one of our working hypotheses.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.760]   We just couldn't find any evidence of that.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:50.600]   - No, lawyers also don't understand it.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:50.920]   - But we asked lawyers.
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.360]   - But you're creating space.
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:58.360]   I mean, you ask in a communist Soviet Union,
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:01.480]   the individual members, their self-report
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:05.080]   is not going to correctly reflect
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:07.320]   what is broken about the gigantic bureaucracy
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.240]   that leads to Chernobyl or something like this.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:14.760]   I think the incentives under which you operate
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:17.960]   are not always transparent to the members
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.320]   within that system.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:22.440]   So it just feels like a strange coincidence
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:26.760]   that there is benefit if you just zoom out,
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.480]   look at the system, as opposed to asking individual lawyers
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.560]   that making something hard to understand
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:34.200]   is going to make a lot of people money.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.160]   - Yeah.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:40.120]   - Like you're gonna need a lawyer to figure that out,
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.360]   I guess, from the perspective of the individual.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.360]   But then that could be the performative aspect.
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.520]   It could be as opposed to the incentive-driven
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:47.320]   to be complicated.
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.720]   It could be performative to where we lawyers
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.440]   speak in this sophisticated way
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.520]   and you regular humans don't understand it,
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.040]   so you need to hire a lawyer.
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.080]   Yeah, I don't know which one it is,
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:58.120]   but it's suspicious.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.800]   Suspicious that it's hard to understand
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:03.480]   and that everybody's eyes glaze over
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.520]   and they don't read.
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:05.960]   - I'm suspicious as well.
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:07.560]   I'm still suspicious.
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:08.680]   And I hear what you're saying.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.680]   It could be no individual,
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:12.040]   and even average of individuals,
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.440]   it could just be a few bad apples in a way
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.760]   which are driving the effect in some way.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.400]   - Influential bad apples that everybody looks up to,
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:25.240]   or whatever, they're like central figures in how--
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.720]   - But it is kind of interesting
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:29.800]   that among our hundred lawyers,
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:31.080]   they did not share that.
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:31.800]   - They didn't want this.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.640]   They really didn't like it.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.720]   - And they weren't better
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:37.800]   than regular people at comprehending it,
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.880]   or they were on average better,
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:41.000]   but they had the same difference.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:41.880]   - They had the same difference.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.600]   - Exact same difference.
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:45.160]   But they wanted it fixed.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:49.240]   And so that gave us hope
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:51.400]   that because it actually isn't very hard
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.800]   to construct a material
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:55.480]   which is un-center-embedded
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:56.680]   and has the same meaning,
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:57.720]   it's not very hard to do.
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:58.920]   Just basically in that situation,
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:59.880]   just putting definitions
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.480]   outside of the subject-verb relation
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.360]   in that particular example,
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.840]   and that's pretty general.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.840]   What they're doing is just throwing stuff in there
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:08.200]   which you didn't have to put in there.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.520]   There's extra words involved.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:12.680]   Typically, you may need a few extra words
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:14.520]   to refer to the things
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.280]   that you're defining outside in some way,
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.160]   'cause if you only use it in that one sentence,
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.720]   then there's no reason to introduce extra terms.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.400]   So we might have a few more words,
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.080]   but it'll be easier to understand.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.560]   So I mean, I have hope
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:32.520]   now that maybe we can make legalese
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.080]   less convoluted in this way.
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.320]   - So maybe the next president of the United States
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.160]   can, instead of saying generic things,
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.480]   say, "I ban center embeddings,"
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.000]   and make Ted the language czar of the United States.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:47.800]   - Or he can make Eric.
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.440]   Martinez is the guy you should really put in there.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.400]   - Eric Martinez, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:52.440]   (laughing)
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:53.160]   - I mean, yeah.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.280]   - But center embeddings are the bad thing to have.
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:57.160]   - That's right.
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.360]   - So if you get rid of that--
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.320]   - That'll do a lot of it.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.120]   - That'll fix a lot.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:01.080]   - Oh, that's fascinating.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.280]   - Yeah. - That is so fascinating.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:02.780]   - Yeah.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:05.960]   - And it is really fascinating on many fronts
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.480]   that humans are just not able to deal
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.440]   with this kind of thing.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.120]   And that language, because of that,
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.160]   evolved in the way you did.
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.040]   It's fascinating.
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:15.560]   So one of the mathematical formulations you have
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.440]   when talking about languages communication
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.760]   is this idea of noisy channels.
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.160]   What's a noisy channel?
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:26.360]   - Well, so that's about communication.
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.360]   And so this is going back to Shannon.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.080]   So Shannon, Claude Shannon was a student at MIT
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:33.800]   in the '40s.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:37.320]   And so he wrote this very influential piece of work
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:40.120]   about communication theory or information theory.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.560]   And he was interested in human language, actually.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:46.600]   He was interested in this problem of communication,
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.080]   of getting a message from my head to your head.
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:54.440]   And he was concerned or interested
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:59.080]   in what was a robust way to do that.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.640]   And so assuming we both speak the same language,
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.480]   we both already speak English,
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:06.040]   whatever the language is, we speak that,
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:10.280]   what is a way that I can say the language
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.360]   so that it's most likely to get the signal
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.200]   that I want to you?
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.720]   And then the problem there in the communication
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.760]   is the noisy channel,
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:23.080]   is that there's a lot of noise in the system.
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.520]   I don't speak perfectly, I make errors, that's noise.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:29.560]   There's background noise, you know that.
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:30.840]   - Like a literal--
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.960]   - Literal background noise.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:33.560]   There is like white noise in the background
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:34.520]   or some other kind of noise.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:38.440]   There's some speaking going on that you're at a party,
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:39.320]   that's background noise.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:41.400]   You're trying to hear someone, it's hard to understand them
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:42.760]   because there's all this other stuff going on
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:43.320]   in the background.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.520]   And then there's noise on the receiver side
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:52.040]   so that you have some problem maybe understanding me
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:54.200]   for stuff that's just internal to you in some way.
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:56.840]   So you've got some other problems, whatever,
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:59.080]   with understanding for whatever reasons.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:01.240]   Maybe you've had too much to drink.
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.800]   You know, who knows why you're not able to pay attention
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:04.360]   to the signal.
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.800]   So that's the noisy channel.
[02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:08.520]   And so that language, if it's a communication system,
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:12.440]   we are trying to optimize in some sense
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:15.160]   the passing of the message from one side to the other.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:21.640]   And so, I mean, one idea is that maybe aspects of like
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:24.440]   word order, for example, might've optimized in some way
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:28.440]   to make language a little more easy to be passed
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:29.880]   from speaker to listener.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.040]   And so Shannon's the guy that did this stuff
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:32.920]   way back in the '40s.
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:34.920]   You know, it's very interesting, historically,
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.080]   he was interested in working in linguistics.
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:40.280]   He was at MIT and he did, this was his master's thesis
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:40.840]   of all things.
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:43.880]   You know, it's crazy how much he did for his master's thesis
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:46.280]   in 1948, I think, or '49, something.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.440]   And he wanted to keep working in language.
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:53.960]   And it just wasn't a popular, communication as a reason,
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.760]   a source for what language was, wasn't popular at the time.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:58.760]   So Chomsky was becoming, it was moving in there.
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.880]   And he just wasn't able to get a handle there, I think.
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:05.880]   And so he moved to Bell Haps and worked on communication
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:09.240]   from a mathematical point of view and was, you know,
[02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:11.560]   did all kinds of amazing work.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:12.120]   And so he's just--
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:14.520]   - More on the signal side versus like the language side.
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:14.920]   - Yeah.
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.400]   - Yeah, it would've been interesting to see
[02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:18.680]   if he pursued the language side.
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:19.000]   - Yeah.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:19.800]   - That's really interesting.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.240]   - Yeah, he was interested in that.
[02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:24.120]   His examples in the '40s are kind of like,
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:27.080]   they're very language-like things.
[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:27.480]   - Yeah.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:31.160]   - We can kind of show that there's a noisy channel process
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:34.520]   going on in when you're listening to me, you know,
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:37.640]   you can often sort of guess what I meant by what I, you know,
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.560]   what you think I meant, given what I said.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:43.240]   And I mean, with respect to sort of why language
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.480]   looks the way it does, we might, there might be sort of,
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:49.000]   as I alluded to, there might be ways in which word order
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.520]   is somewhat optimized for, because of the noisy channel
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.000]   in some way.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.480]   - I mean, that's really cool to sort of model
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:57.800]   if you don't hear certain parts of a sentence
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:00.920]   or have some probability of missing that part,
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.200]   like how do you construct a language
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.320]   that's resilient to that?
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.680]   That's somewhat robust to that.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:05.720]   - Yeah, that's the idea.
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:07.880]   - And then you're kind of saying like the word order
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:11.080]   and the syntax of language, the dependency length
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:13.560]   are all helpful.
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:17.080]   - Yeah, well, the dependency length is really about memory.
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.640]   I think that's like about sort of what's easier or harder
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.920]   to produce in some way.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:23.560]   And these other ideas are about sort of robustness
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:24.440]   to communication.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:28.840]   So the problem of potential loss of signal due to noise.
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:31.640]   It's so that there may be aspects of word order,
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:33.480]   which is somewhat optimized for that.
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:36.360]   And, you know, we have this one guess in that direction.
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:38.040]   These are kind of just so stories.
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:39.240]   I have to be, you know, pretty frank.
[02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:41.480]   They're not like, I can't show this is true.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.320]   All we can do is like, look at the current languages
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:44.120]   of the world.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:46.520]   This is like, we can't sort of see how languages change
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:49.320]   or anything because we've got these snapshots of a few,
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.480]   you know, a hundred or a few thousand languages.
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:54.920]   We don't really, we can't do the right kinds
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:57.560]   of modifications to test these things experimentally.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:00.520]   And so, you know, so just take this with a grain of salt.
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:01.720]   Okay, from here, this stuff.
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:04.840]   The dependency stuff I can, I'm much more solid on.
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:06.280]   And like, here's what the lengths are.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:07.400]   And here's what's hard.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:08.040]   Here's what's easy.
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:09.400]   And this is a reasonable structure.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.600]   I think I'm pretty reasonable.
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:13.320]   Here's like, why, you know, why does a word order
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:14.040]   look the way it does?
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:17.000]   We're now into shaky territory, but it's kind of cool.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.400]   - But we're talking about, just to be clear,
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.240]   we're talking about maybe just actually
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.360]   the sounds of communication.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.120]   Like you and I are sitting in a bar.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.320]   It's very loud.
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:30.360]   And you model with a noisy channel, the loudness,
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.480]   the noise, and we have the signal that's coming across.
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.200]   And you're saying word order might have something
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:39.560]   to do with optimizing that, where there's presence of noise.
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:40.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.480]   - I mean, it's really interesting.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.400]   I mean, to me, it's interesting how much you can load
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:44.360]   into the noisy channel.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.640]   Like how much can you bake in?
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:48.440]   You said like, you know, cognitive load
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:49.320]   on the receiver end.
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:51.480]   - We think that those are, there's three,
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.960]   at least three different kinds of things going on there.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:56.040]   And we probably don't want to treat them all as the same.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:56.440]   - Sure.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.760]   - And so I think that you, you know, the right model,
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.840]   a better model of a noisy channel would treat,
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:03.240]   would have three different sources of noise,
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.720]   which are background noise, you know,
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.040]   speaker inherent noise, and listener inherent noise.
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:11.640]   And those are not, those are all different things.
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:11.960]   - Sure.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:15.080]   But then underneath it, there's a million other subsets.
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:16.680]   - Oh yeah, that's true.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:18.120]   - On the receiving end, I mean,
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:21.000]   I just mentioned cognitive load on both sides.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.200]   Then there's like speech impediments,
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.640]   or just everything.
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:27.960]   World view, I mean, on the meaning,
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.440]   we start to creep into the meaning realm of like,
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.640]   we have different worldviews.
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:33.160]   - Well, how about just form still though?
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:34.840]   Like just what language you know.
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.760]   Like, so how well you know the language.
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.200]   And so if it's second language for you versus first language,
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.360]   and how, maybe what other languages you know,
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.200]   these are still just form stuff.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:46.760]   And that's like potentially very informative.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:48.360]   And, you know, how old you are.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.800]   These things probably matter, right?
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.000]   So like a child learning a language is a, you know,
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.280]   as a noisy representation of English grammar,
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:58.520]   you know, depending on how old they are.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.040]   So maybe when they're six, they're perfectly formed.
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:04.200]   But-- - You mentioned one of the things
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:08.280]   is like a way to measure a language is learning problems.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:11.640]   So like, what's the correlation between everything
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:12.520]   we've been talking about
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.600]   and how easy it is to learn a language?
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:20.200]   So is like short dependencies correlated
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.200]   to ability to learn a language?
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.840]   Is there some kind of, or like the dependency grammar,
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:28.040]   is there some kind of connection there?
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:30.120]   How easy it is to learn?
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:33.160]   - Yeah, well, all the languages in the world's language,
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:36.600]   none is right now we know is any better than any other
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:39.080]   with respect to sort of optimizing dependency links.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:41.240]   For example, they're all kind of do it well.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:42.200]   They all keep low.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.320]   So I think of every human language
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:46.600]   as some kind of an opposite,
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:48.040]   sort of an optimization problem,
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.440]   a complex optimization problem
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:51.960]   to this communication problem.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.880]   And so they've like, they've solved it.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:56.120]   You know, they're just sort of noisy solutions
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:57.800]   to this problem of communication.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:59.880]   There's just so many ways you can do this.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:01.880]   - So they're not optimized for learning.
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:03.400]   They're probably optimized for communication.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:04.840]   - Oh, and learning.
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:07.160]   So yes, one of the factors which is,
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:09.320]   yeah, so learning is messing this up a bit.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.240]   And so, for example,
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:14.280]   if it were just about minimizing dependency links
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:15.720]   and that was all that matters,
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:17.000]   you know, then we, you know,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.720]   so then we might find grammars
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.600]   which didn't have regularity in their rules,
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.800]   but languages always have regularity in their rules.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:27.400]   So what I mean by that is that
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.240]   if I wanted to say something to you
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:30.840]   in the optimal way to say it was,
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.360]   what really mattered to me,
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.360]   all that mattered was keeping the dependencies
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.520]   as close together as possible.
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:38.680]   Then I would have a very lax set
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:40.680]   of free structure or dependency rule.
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:42.040]   I wouldn't have very many of those.
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:43.320]   I would have very little of that.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.720]   And I would just put the words as close,
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:46.920]   the things that refer to the things
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.080]   that are connected right beside each other.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.040]   But we don't do that.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:52.520]   Like there are word order rules, right?
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.440]   So they're very, and depending on the language,
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.040]   they're more and less strict, right?
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:58.520]   So you speak Russian, they're less strict than English.
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:00.840]   English has very rigid word order rules.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:03.160]   We order things in a very particular way.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:05.320]   And so why do we do that?
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:08.760]   Like that's probably not about communication.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:09.800]   That's probably about learning.
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:11.080]   I mean, then we're talking about learning.
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:14.440]   It's probably easier to learn regular things,
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:16.760]   things which are very predictable and easy to,
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:19.480]   so that's probably about learning is our guess,
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:20.840]   'cause that can't be about communication.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.720]   - Can it be just noise?
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:24.760]   Can it be just the messiness
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.120]   of the development of a language?
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:27.720]   - Well, if it were just a communication,
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:29.160]   then we should have languages
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:31.080]   which have very, very free word order.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:31.800]   And we don't have that.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:35.080]   We have free-er, but not free, like there's always--
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.720]   - Well, no, but what I mean by noise
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:40.600]   is like cultural, like sticky cultural things,
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.760]   like the way you communicate,
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:44.760]   just there's a stickiness to it,
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:49.160]   that it's an imperfect, it's a noisy, optimistic, stochastic.
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.080]   The function over which you're optimizing is very noisy.
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:57.720]   So, because I don't, it feels weird to say
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:00.120]   that learning is part of the objective function,
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:02.680]   'cause some languages are way harder to learn than others,
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:05.400]   right, or is that, that's not true?
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.680]   - That's not true. - That's interesting.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:07.320]   - I mean-- - I mean, that's
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.760]   the public sort of perception, right?
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:11.640]   - Yes, that's true for a second language.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:12.520]   - For a second language.
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.920]   - But that depends on what you started with, right?
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:17.880]   So, it really depends on how close that second language
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.080]   is to the first language you've got.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:22.360]   And so, yes, it's very, very hard to learn Arabic
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:23.800]   if you've started with English,
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:26.280]   or it's hard to learn Japanese,
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:29.000]   or if you've started with, Chinese, I think, is the worst.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.840]   There's like Defense Language Institute in the United States
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.200]   has like a list of how hard it is
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:37.800]   to learn what language from English,
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:38.640]   and I think Chinese is the worst.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.280]   - But that's just a second language.
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:41.400]   You're saying babies don't care.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.400]   - No, no, there's no evidence
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.920]   that there's anything harder or easier,
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:46.840]   but any baby, any language learned,
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:49.320]   like by three or four, they speak that language.
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:52.280]   And so, there's no evidence of anything harder or easier
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:53.160]   about any human language.
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:53.960]   They're all kind of equal.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:56.440]   - So, to what degree is language,
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.600]   this is returning to Chomsky a little bit, is innate?
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:04.200]   You said that for Chomsky, he used the idea
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:06.440]   that some aspects of language are innate
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:09.000]   to explain away certain things that are observed.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.920]   But how much are we born with language
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.160]   at the core of our mind, brain?
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.080]   - I mean, the answer is I don't know, of course.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:24.360]   But I mean, I like to, I'm an engineer at heart, I guess,
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.560]   and I sort of think it's fine to postulate
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:28.600]   that a lot of it's learned.
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:31.240]   And so, I'm guessing that a lot of it's learned.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:34.120]   So, I think the reason Chomsky went with the innateness
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:40.120]   is because he hypothesized movement in his grammar.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.680]   He was interested in grammar, and movement's hard to learn.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:43.400]   I think he's right.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.320]   Movement is a hard, it's a hard thing to learn,
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:47.720]   to learn these two things together and how they interact.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:50.280]   And there's a lot of ways in which you might generate
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:52.280]   exactly the same sentences, and it's really hard.
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.840]   And so, he's like, oh, I guess it's learned.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:56.600]   Sorry, so I guess it's not learned, it's innate.
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:59.160]   And if you just throw out the movement
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.680]   and just think about that in a different way,
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:04.280]   then you get some messiness.
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:07.160]   But the messiness is human language,
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.320]   which it actually fits better.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:11.320]   That messiness isn't a problem.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:17.800]   It's actually, it's a valuable asset of the theory.
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:21.000]   And so, I think I don't really see a reason
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.640]   to postulate much innate structure.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:25.640]   And that's kind of why I think these large language models
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.520]   are learning so well, is because I think you can learn
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:32.200]   the form, the forms of human language from the input.
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:34.040]   I think that's like, it's likely to be true.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:35.880]   - So, that part of the brain that lights up
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:37.160]   when you're doing all the comprehension,
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:37.880]   that could be learned.
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:40.280]   That could be just, you don't need, you don't need any.
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.160]   - Yeah, it doesn't have to be innate.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.840]   So, like lots of stuff is modular
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:46.680]   in the brain that's learned.
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:49.480]   It doesn't have to, so there's something called
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.400]   the visual word form area in the back.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:52.760]   And so, it's in the back of your head,
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:56.040]   near the visual cortex, okay?
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:59.640]   And that is very specialized language,
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:01.160]   sorry, very specialized brain area,
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.720]   which does visual word processing if you read,
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:06.600]   if you're a reader, okay?
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.520]   If you don't read, you don't have it, okay?
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:08.920]   Guess what?
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.600]   You spend some time learning to read
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:12.520]   and you develop that brain area,
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:13.720]   which does exactly that.
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:17.480]   And so, the modularization is not evidence for innateness.
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:19.400]   So, the modularization of a language area
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:21.240]   doesn't mean we're born with it.
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:23.080]   We could have easily learned that.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:25.000]   We might have been born with it.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.160]   We just don't know at this point.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.680]   We might very well have been born
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.760]   with this left-lateralized area.
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:31.880]   I mean, there's like a lot
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:33.960]   of other interesting components here,
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:36.280]   features of this kind of argument.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.000]   So, some people get a stroke
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.320]   or something goes really wrong on the left side,
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.240]   where the language area would be.
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:45.560]   And that isn't there.
[02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:46.520]   It's not available.
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:48.120]   And it develops just fine on the right.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:49.960]   So, it's not about the left.
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:52.360]   It goes to the left.
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:53.720]   Like, this is a very interesting question.
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:57.720]   It's like, why are any of the brain areas
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:58.520]   the way that they are?
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:00.440]   And how did they come to be that way?
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:04.280]   And there's these natural experiments which happen,
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:06.760]   where people get these strange events
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:08.680]   in their brains at very young ages,
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:10.600]   which wipe out sections of their brain.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:13.400]   And they behave totally normally,
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.760]   and no one knows anything was wrong.
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:15.880]   And we find out later,
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:17.720]   'cause they happen to be accidentally scanned
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:18.360]   for some reason.
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:20.600]   It's like, what happened to your left hemisphere?
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:21.480]   It's missing.
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:22.520]   There's not many people who've missed
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:23.400]   their whole left hemisphere,
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:24.920]   but they'll be missing some other section
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.280]   of their left or their right.
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.800]   And they behave absolutely normally.
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:28.920]   We'd never know.
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.440]   So, that's like a very interesting current research.
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.320]   This is another project that this person,
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.520]   Ev Fedorenko, is working on.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:38.600]   She's got all these people contacting her,
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:40.520]   because she's scanned some people
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:44.040]   who have been missing sections.
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:46.040]   One person missed a section of her brain
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:47.560]   and was scanned in her lab.
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:50.200]   And she happened to be a writer for the New York Times.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.720]   And there was an article in the New York Times
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.280]   just about the scanning procedure
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.920]   and about what might be learned
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:02.200]   by sort of the general process of MRI and language.
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:04.040]   And that's her language.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:06.040]   And because she's writing for the New York Times,
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.440]   all these people started writing to her,
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:11.880]   who also have similar kinds of deficits,
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:16.360]   because they've been accidentally scanned for some reason
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:19.160]   and found out they're missing some section.
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.960]   And they volunteer to be scanned.
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.560]   - So, these are natural experiments.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:24.360]   - Natural experiments.
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:26.440]   They're kind of messy, but natural experiments.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:26.920]   It's kind of cool.
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.000]   She calls them interesting brains.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.520]   - The first few hours, days, months of human life
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.320]   are fascinating.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.880]   It's like, well, inside the womb, actually,
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:36.920]   like that development.
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:41.320]   That machinery, whatever that is,
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.040]   seems to create powerful humans
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:46.040]   that are able to speak, comprehend, think,
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.960]   all that kind of stuff, no matter what happens.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.400]   Not no matter what, but robust to the different ways
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:56.280]   that the brain might be damaged and so on.
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.200]   That's really interesting.
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:01.240]   But what would Chomsky say about the fact,
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.760]   the thing you're saying now,
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:08.440]   that language seems to be happening separate from thought?
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:09.720]   Because as far as I understand,
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:10.600]   maybe you can correct me,
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:12.360]   he thought that language underpins--
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:13.800]   - Yeah, he thinks so.
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:14.680]   I don't know what he'd say.
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.800]   - He would be surprised.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:18.200]   Because for him, the idea is that language
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:20.680]   is sort of the foundation of thought.
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:22.600]   - That's right, absolutely.
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:26.600]   - And it's pretty mind-blowing to think
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.600]   that it could be completely separate from thought.
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:28.920]   - That's right.
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:32.360]   So he's basically a philosopher,
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:33.560]   philosopher of language, in a way,
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:34.440]   thinking about these things.
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:35.320]   It's a fine thought.
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:39.240]   You can't test it in his methods.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:41.720]   You can't do a thought experiment to figure that out.
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:44.760]   You need a scanner, you need brain-damaged people,
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:47.320]   you need something, you need ways to measure that.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:49.400]   And that's what fMRI offers.
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:53.880]   And patients are a little messier.
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:56.600]   fMRI is pretty unambiguous, I'd say.
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:57.800]   It's very unambiguous.
[02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:01.320]   There's no way to say that the language network
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:03.320]   is doing any of these tasks.
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.400]   You should look at those data.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:07.160]   It's like there's no chance that you can say
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:09.400]   that those networks are overlapping.
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:10.120]   They're not overlapping.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:11.400]   They're just completely different.
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:16.200]   So you can always make, "Oh, it's only two people.
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:18.920]   "It's four people," or something for the patients.
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:20.760]   And there's something special about them we don't know.
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:24.680]   But these are just random people, and with lots of them.
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:27.160]   And you find always the same effects.
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:28.600]   And it's very robust, I'd say.
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:30.200]   - Well, it's a fascinating effect.
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:33.000]   You mentioned Bolivia.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:37.000]   What's the connection between culture and language?
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:45.400]   You've also mentioned that much of our study of language
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:49.880]   comes from W-E-I-R-D, weird people,
[02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:52.680]   Western-educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:57.160]   So when you study remote cultures,
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:20:59.080]   such as around the Amazon jungle,
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:01.000]   what can you learn about language?
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.400]   - So that term "weird" is from Joe Henrich.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.840]   He's at Harvard.
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:09.240]   He's a Harvard evolutionary biologist.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:13.400]   And so he works on lots of different topics.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:17.000]   And he basically was pushing that observation
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.360]   that we should be careful
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:20.360]   about the inferences we want to make
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:23.880]   when we're talking in psychology or sociology,
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:25.240]   yeah, mostly in psychology, I guess,
[02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:30.280]   about humans if we're talking about undergrads
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:31.320]   at MIT and Harvard.
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:33.160]   Those aren't the same, right?
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:34.120]   These aren't the same things.
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:35.640]   And so if you want to make inferences
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.640]   about language, for instance,
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:42.120]   there's a lot of other kinds of languages in the world
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:44.680]   than English and French and Chinese.
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:48.280]   And so maybe for language,
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.120]   we care about how culture,
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:51.960]   'cause cultures can be very,
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.960]   I mean, of course, English and Chinese cultures
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:54.600]   are very different,
[02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:59.160]   but hunter-gatherers are much more different in some ways.
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:03.080]   And so if culture has an effect on what language is,
[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:06.760]   then we kind of want to look there as well as looking.
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:08.680]   It's not like the industrialized cultures aren't interesting.
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.640]   Of course they are.
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:13.000]   But we want to look at non-industrialized cultures as well.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.520]   And so I've worked with two.
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:15.560]   I've worked with the Chimani,
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:19.880]   which are in Bolivia and Amazon,
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:21.400]   both in the Amazon in these cases.
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:24.040]   And there are so-called farmer-foragers,
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.480]   which is not hunter-gatherers.
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:28.440]   It's sort of one up from hunter-gatherers
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:30.360]   in that they do a little bit of farming as well,
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.960]   a lot of hunting as well,
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:33.400]   but a little bit of farming.
[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:34.520]   And the kind of farming they do
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.440]   is the kind of farming that I might do
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:38.600]   if I ever were to grow like tomatoes
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:39.880]   or something in my backyard.
[02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:42.280]   So it's not like big field farming.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:44.600]   It's just farming for a family,
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:45.800]   a few things, you do that.
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:47.400]   So that's the kind of farming they do.
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.600]   And the other group I've worked with
[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:54.200]   are the Piraha, which are also in the Amazon
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:56.040]   and happen to be in Brazil.
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:59.000]   And that's with a guy called Dan Everett,
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.440]   who is a linguist anthropologist
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:05.240]   who actually lived and worked in the,
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:07.800]   I mean, he was a missionary actually initially
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:09.560]   back in the '70s,
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:12.280]   working with trying to translate languages
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:13.880]   so they could teach them the Bible,
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:14.760]   teach them Christianity.
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.280]   - What can you say about that?
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:19.160]   - Yeah, so the two groups I've worked with,
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:22.440]   the Chimani and the Piraha are both isolate languages,
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:26.280]   meaning there's no known connected languages at all.
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:27.320]   They're just like on their own.
[02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:27.560]   - Oh, cool.
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:28.760]   - Yeah, there's a lot of those.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:34.040]   And most of the isolates occur in the Amazon
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.240]   or in Papua New Guinea.
[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:38.840]   And these places where the world
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:41.720]   has sort of stayed still for a long enough,
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:45.560]   and so there aren't earthquakes.
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:49.240]   There aren't, well, certainly no earthquakes
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:50.520]   in the Amazon jungle.
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:53.720]   And the climate isn't bad,
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:55.080]   so you don't have droughts.
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:58.680]   And so in Africa, you've got a lot of moving of people
[02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:00.120]   because there's drought problems.
[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:01.960]   And so they get a lot of language contact
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:03.560]   when you have, when people have to,
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:07.240]   if you've got to move because you've got no water,
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:08.600]   then you've got to get going.
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:12.120]   And then you run into contact with other tribes,
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:13.320]   other groups.
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:15.000]   In the Amazon, that's not the case.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.400]   And so people can stay there for hundreds and hundreds
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:19.000]   and probably thousands of years, I guess.
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.280]   And so these groups, the Chimani and the Piraha
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:23.720]   are both isolates in that.
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:25.480]   And they can just, I guess they've just lived there
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:28.440]   for ages and ages with minimal contact
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:30.600]   with other outside groups.
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:35.000]   And so, I mean, I'm interested in them because they are,
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000]   I mean, in these cases, I'm interested in their words.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.680]   I would love to study their syntax,
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:43.240]   their orders of words, but I'm mostly just interested
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.800]   in how languages are connected
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.320]   to their cultures in this way.
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:51.560]   And so with the Piraha, sort of most interesting,
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:54.760]   I was working on number there, number information.
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:57.400]   And so the basic idea is I think language is invented.
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:58.760]   That's what I get from the words here
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:00.440]   is that I think language is invented.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.800]   We talked about color earlier.
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:05.880]   It's the same idea so that what you need to talk about
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:09.160]   with someone else is what you're gonna invent words for.
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:12.680]   And so we invent labels for colors that I need,
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:16.920]   not that I can see, but the things I need to tell you about
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:18.440]   so that I can get objects from you
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.040]   or get you to give me the right objects.
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:21.800]   And I just don't need a word for teal
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:26.920]   or a word for aquamarine in the Amazon jungle
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.760]   for the most part, because I don't have two things
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.280]   which differ on those colors.
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:31.480]   I just don't have that.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.400]   And so numbers are really another fascinating source
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:39.640]   of information here where you might, naively,
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.400]   I certainly thought that all humans would have words
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:47.160]   for exact counting and the Piraha don't.
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:50.440]   Okay, so they don't have any words for even one.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:54.040]   There's not a word for one in their language.
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:56.040]   And so there's certainly not a word for two, three or four.
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:59.160]   So that kind of blows people's minds off.
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:00.600]   - Yeah, that is blowing my mind.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:01.800]   - That's pretty weird, isn't it?
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:03.720]   - How are you gonna ask, I want two of those?
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:04.840]   - You just don't.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:07.720]   And so that's just not a thing you can possibly ask
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.240]   in the Piraha, it's not possible.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:10.680]   That is, there's no words for that.
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:12.440]   So here's how we found this out.
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.200]   Okay, so it was thought to be a one, two, many language.
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:19.480]   There are three words for quantifiers for sets,
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:23.800]   but people had thought that those meant one, two and many.
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:26.920]   But what they really mean is few, some and many.
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:29.000]   Many is correct, it's few, some and many.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]   And so the way we figured this out,
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:35.960]   and this is kind of cool, is that we gave people,
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:38.520]   we had a set of objects, okay?
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:39.880]   These were having to be spools of thread,
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:42.280]   doesn't really matter what they are, identical objects.
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:46.120]   And I sort of start off here, I just give you one of those
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:46.920]   and say, what's that?
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:49.640]   Okay, so you're a Piraha speaker and you tell me what it is.
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:51.640]   And then I give you two and say, what's that?
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.080]   And nothing's changing in the set except for the number, okay?
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:56.760]   And then I just ask you to label these things.
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:58.280]   We just do this for a bunch of different people.
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:00.600]   And frankly, I did this task.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:02.440]   - This is fascinating. - And it's a weird,
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:03.320]   it's a little bit weird.
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:06.920]   So they say the word that we thought was one, it's few,
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:09.160]   but for the first one, and then maybe they say few,
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:11.000]   or maybe they say some for the second.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.200]   And then for the third or the fourth,
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:15.160]   they start using the word many for the set.
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.280]   And then five, six, seven, eight, I go all the way to 10.
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:20.520]   And it's always the same word.
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:21.880]   And they look at me like I'm stupid
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:26.040]   because they told me what the word was for six, seven, eight.
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:28.680]   And I'm gonna continue asking them at nine and 10.
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:30.200]   I'm like, I'm sorry, I just...
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:32.360]   They understand that I wanna know their language.
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:33.640]   That's the point of the task,
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:35.960]   is I'm trying to learn their language, and so that's okay.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.960]   But it does seem like I'm a little slow
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:41.880]   'cause they already told me what the word for many was,
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:43.480]   five, six, seven, and I keep asking.
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:46.040]   So it's a little funny to do this task over and over.
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:49.160]   We did this with a guy called, Dan was our translator.
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.160]   He's the only one who really speaks Piraha fluently.
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:56.760]   He's a good bilingual for a bunch of languages,
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:59.160]   but also English and Piraha.
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:00.440]   And then a guy called Mike Frank
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.840]   was also a student with me down there.
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.040]   He and I did these things.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:06.840]   And so you do that, okay?
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:07.960]   And everyone does the same thing.
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:10.520]   We asked like 10 people,
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:13.400]   and they all do exactly the same labeling for one up.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:15.400]   And then we just do the same thing down
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:16.680]   on like random order, actually.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:19.000]   We do some of them up, some of them down first, okay?
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.280]   And so we do, instead of one to 10, we do 10 down to one.
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:24.680]   And so I give them 10, nine, at eight,
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.920]   they start saying the word for some.
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:28.920]   And then when you get to four,
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:31.000]   everyone is saying the word for few,
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.280]   which we thought was one.
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:34.360]   So it's like the context determined
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:37.480]   what that quantifier they used was.
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:38.760]   So it's not a count word.
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:40.360]   They're not count words.
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:41.480]   They're just approximate words.
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:42.440]   - And they're gonna be noisy
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.960]   when you interview a bunch of people
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:45.480]   with the definition of few,
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:47.240]   and there's gonna be a threshold in the context.
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:49.160]   - Yeah, yeah, I don't know what that means.
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.680]   That's gonna depend on the context.
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:51.960]   I think it's true in English too, right?
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:53.640]   If you ask an English person what a few is,
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.960]   I mean, that's gonna depend completely on the context.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:58.680]   - And that might actually be, at first, hard to discover,
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:00.680]   'cause for a lot of people,
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:03.960]   the jump from one to two will be few, right?
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:04.600]   So it's a jump.
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:06.600]   - Yeah, it might still be there, yeah.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:09.000]   - I mean, that's fascinating.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]   That's fascinating that numbers don't present themselves.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.440]   - Yeah, so the words aren't there.
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:13.960]   And so then we do these other things.
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:16.280]   Well, if they don't have the words,
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.480]   can they do exact matching kinds of tasks?
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:21.480]   Can they even do those tasks?
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:24.360]   And the answer is sort of yes and no.
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:26.440]   And so yes, they can do them.
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:28.040]   So here's the tasks that we did.
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:30.360]   We put out those spools of thread again, okay?
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:32.280]   So maybe I put like three out here.
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:34.680]   And then we gave them some objects.
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:37.320]   And those happened to be uninflated red balloons.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:39.000]   It doesn't really matter what they are.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.080]   It's just they're a bunch of exactly the same thing.
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:43.000]   And it was easy to put down
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.840]   right next to these spools of thread, okay?
[02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:48.280]   And so then I put out three of these.
[02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:50.280]   And your task was to just put one
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:52.040]   against each of my three things.
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.040]   And they could do that perfectly.
[02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:55.160]   So I mean, I would actually do that.
[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:57.000]   It was a very easy task to explain to them
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.560]   because I did this with this guy, Mike Frank,
[02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:03.480]   and I'd be the experimenter telling him to do this
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:04.600]   and showing him to do this.
[02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:06.040]   And then we just like, just do what he did.
[02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:06.920]   You'll copy him.
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.840]   All we had to, I didn't have to speak Pirohan
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:10.680]   except for know what, copy him.
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:13.160]   Like do what he did is like all we had to be able to say.
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:15.560]   And then they would do that just perfectly.
[02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:16.760]   And so we'd move it up.
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.120]   We do some sort of random number of items up to 10.
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:22.440]   And they basically do perfectly on that.
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:23.480]   They never get that wrong.
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:25.160]   I mean, that's not a counting task, right?
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:26.120]   That is just a match.
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:27.240]   You just put one against it.
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:28.040]   It doesn't matter how many,
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:29.480]   I don't need to know how many there are there
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:31.000]   to do that correctly.
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.040]   And they would make mistakes, but very, very few.
[02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:36.440]   And no more than MIT undergrads.
[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:37.160]   (laughs)
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:40.040]   Just gonna say, like there's no, these are low stakes.
[02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.080]   So, you know, you make mistakes.
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:42.200]   - So counting is not required
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:43.080]   to complete the matching task.
[02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:44.280]   - That's right, not at all.
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:46.680]   Okay, and so that's our control.
[02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:49.160]   And this guy had gone down there before
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:50.680]   and said that they couldn't do this task.
[02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:52.280]   But I just don't know what he did wrong there
[02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:54.200]   'cause they can do this task perfectly well.
[02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:57.000]   And, you know, I can train my dog to do this task.
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.440]   So of course they can do this task.
[02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:00.360]   And so, you know, it's not a hard task.
[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:03.320]   But the other task that was sort of more interesting
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:04.760]   is like, so then we do a bunch of tasks
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:10.280]   where you need some way to encode the set.
[02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:12.360]   So like one of them is just,
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:18.200]   I just put a opaque sheet in front of the things.
[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:19.880]   I put down a bunch, a set of these things
[02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:21.320]   and I put an opaque sheet down.
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:23.160]   And so you can't see them anymore.
[02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:24.680]   And I tell you, do the same thing
[02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:26.040]   you were doing before, right?
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:28.280]   And it's easy if it's two or three, it's very easy.
[02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:30.440]   But if I don't have the words for eight,
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:33.320]   it's a little harder, like maybe, you know,
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:34.920]   with practice, well no.
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:37.000]   - 'Cause you have to count.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.560]   - For us it's easy 'cause we just count them.
[02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:41.240]   It's just so easy to count them.
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:43.320]   But they don't, they can't count them
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:44.040]   because they don't count.
[02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:45.400]   They don't have words for this thing.
[02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:46.760]   And so they would do approximate.
[02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:47.800]   It's totally fascinating.
[02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:49.960]   So they would get them approximately right,
[02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:52.520]   you know, after four or five.
[02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:54.200]   You know, 'cause you can basically,
[02:31:54.200 --> 02:31:55.560]   you always get four right.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:57.240]   Three or four, that looks,
[02:31:57.240 --> 02:31:58.600]   that's something we can visually see.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:01.000]   But after that, you kind of have,
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.360]   it's an approximate number.
[02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:03.960]   And so then, and there's a bunch of tasks we did
[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:07.080]   and they all failed, I mean, failed.
[02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:10.520]   They did approximate after five on all those tasks.
[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:12.280]   And it kind of shows that the words,
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:15.240]   you kind of need the words, you know,
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:17.240]   to be able to do these kinds of tasks.
[02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:19.320]   - There's a little bit of a chicken and egg thing there.
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:21.640]   Because if you don't have the words,
[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:25.320]   then maybe they'll limit you in the kind of,
[02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:27.960]   like a little baby Einstein there
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:31.480]   won't be able to come up with a counting task.
[02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:31.960]   You know what I mean?
[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:34.440]   Like the ability to count enables you
[02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:36.680]   to come up with interesting things probably.
[02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:41.000]   So yes, you develop counting because you need it.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.160]   But then once you have counting,
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:44.280]   you can probably come up
[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:45.800]   with a bunch of different inventions.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:47.800]   Like how to, I don't know.
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.480]   (inhales)
[02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:50.360]   What kind of thing?
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:53.160]   They do matching really well for building purposes,
[02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:55.720]   building some kind of hut or something like this.
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:00.120]   So it's interesting that language is a limiter
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:01.480]   on what you're able to do.
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:03.960]   - Yeah, here language is just, is the words.
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:04.920]   Here is the words.
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:07.000]   Like the words for exact count
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.720]   is the limiting factor here.
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:10.600]   They just don't have them.
[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:12.680]   - Yeah, that's what I mean.
[02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:17.400]   That limit is also a limit on the society
[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:18.520]   of what they're able to build.
[02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:20.520]   - That's gonna be true, yeah.
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:22.840]   So it's probably, I mean, we don't know.
[02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:24.760]   This is one of those problems with the snapshot
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:26.200]   of just current languages
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:28.280]   is that we don't know what causes a culture
[02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:31.800]   to discover/invent a counting system.
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:33.960]   But the hypothesis is the guess out there
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:35.320]   is something to do with farming.
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:37.400]   So if you have a bunch of goats
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:40.520]   and you wanna keep track of them
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.160]   and you have say 17 goats and you go to bed at night
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:44.520]   and you get up in the morning,
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:47.400]   boy, it's easier to have a count system to do that.
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:50.520]   That's an abstraction over a set.
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:53.160]   So they don't have, like, people often ask me
[02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:54.600]   when I tell them about this kind of work,
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:56.840]   they say, "Well, don't these Purahan, don't they have kids?
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:33:57.800]   "Don't they have a lot of children?"
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:33:59.240]   I'm like, "Yeah, they have a lot of children."
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:01.240]   And they do, they often have families
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:02.600]   of three or four or five kids.
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:04.360]   And they go, "Well, don't they need the numbers
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:05.320]   "to keep track of their kids?"
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:07.480]   And I always ask this person who says this,
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:08.520]   like, "Do you have children?"
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:10.760]   And the answer's always no
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:12.600]   because that's not how you keep track of your kids.
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:15.000]   You care about their identities.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000]   It's very important to me when I go,
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:17.960]   "I think I have five children."
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:20.680]   - You don't think one, two, three, four?
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:22.840]   - Yeah, it matters which five.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:26.840]   If you replaced one with someone else, I would care.
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:28.200]   A goat, maybe not, right?
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:29.000]   That's the kind of point.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.200]   It's an abstraction.
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:32.040]   Something that looks very similar to the one
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:33.400]   wouldn't matter to me probably.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.400]   - But if you care about goats,
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:37.640]   you're gonna know them actually individually also.
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:38.200]   - Yeah, you will.
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:40.760]   - I mean, cows, goats, if there's a source of food and milk
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:41.640]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:43.080]   you're gonna actually really, really care.
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:44.600]   - But I'm saying it is an abstraction
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:47.080]   such that you don't have to care about their identities
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:48.120]   to do this thing fast.
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:49.800]   That's the hypothesis, not mine.
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:52.840]   From anthropologists as a guessing
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:55.080]   about where words for counting came from
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:56.360]   is from farming, maybe.
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:57.580]   - Yeah.
[02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:00.840]   Do you have a sense why universal languages
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:02.520]   like Esperanto have not taken off?
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.400]   Like, why do we have all these different languages?
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:07.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:11.480]   Well, my guess is that the function of a language
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:13.240]   is to do something in a community.
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:16.360]   I mean, unless there's some function to that language
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:18.840]   in the community, it's not gonna survive.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:19.720]   It's not gonna be useful.
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:20.840]   So here's a great example.
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:24.760]   Language death is super common, okay?
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:27.800]   Languages are dying all around the world,
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:29.160]   and here's why they're dying.
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:30.760]   Yeah, I see this.
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:33.080]   It's not happening right now
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:35.160]   in either the Chimane or the Piraha,
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:36.520]   but it probably will.
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:38.840]   And so there's a neighboring group called Mocitan,
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:42.760]   which is, I said that it's isolated.
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:43.880]   It's actually, there's a dual.
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:44.840]   There's two of them, okay?
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:47.240]   So there's two languages which are really close,
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:51.000]   which are Mocitan and Chimane,
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.520]   which are unrelated to anything else.
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:54.680]   And Mocitan is unlike Chimane
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:57.400]   in that it has a lot of contact with Spanish,
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:35:58.360]   and it's dying.
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:35:59.560]   So that language is dying.
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:03.000]   The reason it's dying is there's not a lot of value
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.600]   for the local people in their native language.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:08.440]   So there's much more value in knowing Spanish,
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:11.480]   like because they wanna feed their families.
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:12.520]   And how do you feed your family?
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:14.760]   You learn Spanish so you can make money,
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:16.360]   so you can get a job and do these things,
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:17.960]   and then you make money.
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:19.800]   And so they want Spanish things.
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:23.560]   They want, and so Mocitan is in danger and is dying.
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:24.920]   And that's normal.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:27.000]   And so basically the problem is that people,
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:30.760]   the reason we learn language is to communicate,
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:35.000]   and we use it to make money
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.200]   and to do whatever it is to feed our families.
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:42.600]   And if that's not happening, then it won't take off.
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:44.440]   It's not like a game or something.
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:46.040]   This is like something we use.
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:47.320]   Why is English so popular?
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:49.800]   It's not because it's an easy language to learn.
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:51.480]   Maybe it is.
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:52.200]   I don't really know.
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:54.200]   But that's not why it's popular.
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:57.320]   - But because the United States is a gigantic economy,
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:57.720]   and therefore-- - Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:36:59.160]   It's big economies that do this.
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:36:59.880]   It's all it is.
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:02.120]   It's all about money, and that's what,
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:05.480]   and so there's a motivation to learn Mandarin.
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:06.760]   There's a motivation to learn Spanish.
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:08.120]   There's a motivation to learn English.
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:09.880]   These languages are very valuable to know
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:12.280]   because there's so, so many speakers all over the world.
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:13.080]   - That's fascinating.
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:15.400]   - There's less of a value economically.
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:16.760]   It's kind of what drives this.
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:19.880]   It's not just for fun.
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:21.000]   I mean, there are these groups
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.280]   that do want to learn language just for language's sake,
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:26.360]   and there's something to that.
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:29.080]   But those are rarities in general.
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:31.560]   Those are a few small groups that do that.
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:32.680]   Not most people don't do that.
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:34.200]   - Well, if that was the primary driver,
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:35.800]   then everybody was speaking English
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:37.240]   or speaking one language.
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:39.000]   There's also a tension-- - That's happening.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.720]   - And that, well, well-- - We're moving towards
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:43.240]   fewer and fewer languages. - We are.
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:44.520]   - Yeah, yeah. - I wonder, you're right.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:47.480]   Maybe, you know, this is slow,
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:49.000]   but maybe that's where we're moving.
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.760]   But there is a tension.
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:53.640]   You're saying a language that the fringes,
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:58.120]   but if you look at geopolitics and superpowers,
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.040]   it does seem that there's another thing in tension,
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:04.040]   which is a language is a national identity sometimes.
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:05.640]   - Oh, yeah. - For certain nations.
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:07.400]   I mean, that's the war in Ukraine.
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.240]   Language, Ukrainian language is a symbol of that war
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:14.520]   in many ways, like a country fighting for its own identity.
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.760]   So it's not merely the convenience.
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:18.520]   I mean, those two things are a tension,
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:21.720]   is the convenience of trade and the economics
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:25.240]   and be able to communicate with neighboring countries
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:28.200]   and trade more efficiently with neighboring countries,
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:30.280]   all that kind of stuff, but also identity--
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.320]   - That's right. - Of the group.
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:33.720]   - I completely agree. - 'Cause language is the way,
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:39.160]   for every community, like dialects that emerge
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:40.920]   are a kind of identity for people.
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.520]   - Yeah. - And sometimes a way
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.600]   for people to say F-U to the more powerful people.
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:48.280]   - Yeah. - And it's interesting.
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.160]   So in that way, language can be used as that tool.
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:52.760]   - Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.600]   And there's a lot of work to try to create that identity
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:38:57.960]   so people want to do that.
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.840]   As a cognitive scientist and language expert,
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:06.440]   I hope that continues because I don't want languages to die.
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:07.800]   I want languages to survive
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:13.320]   because they're so interesting for so many reasons.
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:15.880]   But I mean, I find them fascinating
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:18.520]   just for the language part, but I think there's a lot
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.040]   of connections to culture as well,
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:21.240]   which is also very important.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:25.400]   - Do you have hope for machine translation
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400]   that can break down the barriers of language?
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.960]   So while all these different diverse languages exist,
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:32.840]   I guess there's many ways of asking this question,
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.760]   but basically how hard is it to translate
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:40.200]   in an automated way from one language to another?
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.400]   - There's gonna be cases
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.160]   where it's gonna be really hard, right?
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:47.080]   So there are concepts that are in one language
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:47.880]   and not in another.
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:49.560]   Like the most extreme kinds of cases
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:51.400]   are these cases of number information.
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.640]   So like good luck translating a lot of English into Piraha.
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.680]   It's just impossible.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:58.600]   There's no way to do it because there are no words
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:00.760]   for these concepts that we're talking about.
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.640]   There's probably the flip side, right?
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:05.640]   There's probably stuff in Piraha
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:08.280]   which is gonna be hard to translate
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:09.800]   into English on the other side.
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:11.800]   And so I just don't know what those concepts are.
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:15.640]   I mean, the space, the world space is different
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:16.600]   from my world space.
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:17.720]   And so I don't know what,
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:19.000]   so that the things they talk about,
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.640]   things are, it's gonna have to do with their life
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:24.280]   as opposed to my industrial life,
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:25.720]   which is gonna be different.
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:28.520]   And so there's gonna be problems like that always.
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:31.240]   There's like, maybe it's not so bad
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:32.520]   in the case of some of these spaces
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:34.120]   and maybe it's gonna be harder in others.
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:36.360]   And so it's pretty bad in number.
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.560]   It's like extreme, I'd say in the number space,
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:42.040]   exact number space, but in the color dimension, right?
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:43.000]   So that's not so bad.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.960]   I mean, but it's a problem
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:49.480]   that you don't have ways to talk about the concepts.
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:51.640]   - And there might be entire concepts that are missing.
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:54.200]   But to you, it's more about the space of concept
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:55.480]   versus the space of form.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:58.040]   Like form, you can probably map.
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:40:59.160]   - Yes, yeah.
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:01.800]   But so you were talking earlier about translation
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:04.280]   and about how translations,
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:06.360]   there's good and bad translations.
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:08.760]   I mean, now we're talking about translations of form, right?
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:11.400]   So what makes a writing good, right?
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.240]   - There's a music to the form.
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:15.320]   - Right, it's not just the content.
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:17.400]   It's how it's written.
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.080]   And translating that, that sounds difficult.
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:24.840]   - So we should say that there is like,
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:26.840]   I don't hesitate to say meaning,
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.280]   but there's a music and a rhythm to the form.
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.120]   When you look at the broad picture,
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:34.840]   like the difference between Dostoevsky and Tolstoy
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:40.840]   or Hemingway, Bukowski, James Joyce, like I mentioned,
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:42.920]   there's a beat to it, there's an edge to it
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:44.760]   that it's like is in the form.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.560]   - We can probably get measures of those.
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:48.040]   - Yeah.
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:49.720]   - I don't know.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:52.840]   I'm optimistic that we could get measures of those things.
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:53.800]   And so maybe that's--
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:54.680]   - Translatable.
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:55.320]   - I don't know.
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:55.960]   I don't know though.
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:57.240]   I have not worked on that.
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:58.520]   - I would love to see--
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:41:59.560]   - That sounds totally fascinating.
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:04.840]   - Translation to Hemingway is probably the lowest,
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:06.920]   I would love to see different authors,
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:11.640]   but the average per sentence dependency length
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:13.720]   for Hemingway is probably the shortest.
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:15.720]   - Huh, huh, that's your sense, huh?
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:18.920]   It's simple sentences with short, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:21.400]   - I mean, that's when, if you have really long sentences,
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:23.320]   even if they don't have center embedding, like--
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:25.000]   - They can have longer connections, yeah.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.040]   - They can have longer connections.
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:27.000]   - They don't have to, right?
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.360]   You can't have a long, long sentence
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:29.800]   with a bunch of local words, yeah.
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:30.200]   - Yeah.
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:33.400]   - But it is much more likely to have the possibility
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.320]   of long dependencies with long sentences, yeah.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:39.000]   - I met a guy named Azaroskin
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.120]   who does a lot of cool stuff, really brilliant.
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:43.960]   He works with Tristan Harris and a bunch of stuff,
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:49.960]   but he was talking to me about communicating with animals.
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.040]   He co-founded Earth Species Project,
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:55.240]   where you're trying to find the common language
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:57.640]   between whales, crows, and humans.
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:02.120]   And he was saying that there's a lot of promising work
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:04.840]   that even though the signals are very different,
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:10.760]   like the actual, if you have embeddings of the languages,
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:14.120]   they're actually trying to communicate similar type things.
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:18.360]   Is there something you can comment on that,
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:20.760]   like where, is there promise to that
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:22.680]   in everything you've seen in different cultures,
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:24.120]   especially like remote cultures,
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:25.400]   that this is a possibility?
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:27.120]   Or no, that we can talk to whales?
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:29.960]   - I would say yes.
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.880]   I think it's not crazy at all.
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:33.480]   I think it's quite reasonable.
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:37.400]   There's this sort of weird view, well, odd view, I think,
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:41.640]   to think that human language is somehow special.
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:44.600]   Maybe it is.
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:48.040]   We can certainly do more than any of the other species.
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:54.600]   And maybe our language system is part of that.
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:55.400]   It's possible.
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.000]   But people have often talked about how human,
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.760]   like Chomsky, in fact, has talked about
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:07.160]   how only human language has this compositionality thing
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:09.480]   that he thinks is sort of key in language.
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:11.960]   And it's, the problem with that argument
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:13.320]   is he doesn't speak whale.
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:16.360]   And he doesn't speak crow.
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:17.400]   And he doesn't speak monkey.
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:19.880]   They say things like, well, they're making
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:21.240]   a bunch of grunts and squeaks.
[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:25.400]   And the reasoning is like, that's bad reasoning.
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:28.600]   I'm pretty sure if you asked a whale what we're saying,
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:30.840]   they'd say, well, I'm making a bunch of weird noises.
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:31.340]   - Exactly.
[02:44:31.340 --> 02:44:35.160]   - And so it's like, this is a very odd reasoning
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.000]   to be making that human language is special
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.600]   because we're the only ones who have human language.
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:42.280]   I'm like, well, we don't know what those other,
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:44.760]   we just don't, we can't talk to them yet.
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.680]   And so there are probably a signal in there.
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.040]   And it might very well be something complicated
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:51.240]   like human language.
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.960]   I mean, sure, with a small brain in lower species,
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:57.720]   there's probably not a very good communication system.
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:00.120]   But in these higher species where you have
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:05.160]   what seems to be abilities to communicate something,
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:07.560]   there might very well be a lot more signal there
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:10.600]   than we might have otherwise thought.
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:13.640]   - But also if we have a lot of intellectual humility here,
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:16.120]   somebody formerly from MIT, Neri Oxman,
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:19.560]   who I admire very much, has talked a lot about,
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:23.640]   has worked on communicating with plants.
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:28.200]   So like, yes, the signal there is even less than,
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:30.840]   but like, it's not out of the realm of possibility
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:34.520]   that all nature has a way of communicating.
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:36.440]   And it's a very different language,
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:39.160]   but they do develop a kind of language
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:40.200]   through the chemistry,
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:43.560]   through some way of communicating with each other.
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:46.120]   And if you have enough humility about that possibility,
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:49.640]   I think you can, I think it would be a very interesting,
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.840]   in a few decades, maybe centuries, hopefully not,
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.240]   a humbling possibility of being able to communicate,
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.560]   not just between humans effectively,
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.840]   but between all of living things on Earth.
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:05.160]   - Well, I mean, I think some of them
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:07.080]   are not gonna have much interesting to say,
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:08.360]   but some of them will. - But you could still--
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:09.160]   - We don't know.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:10.120]   We certainly don't know.
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:13.080]   - But I think if we're humble,
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:15.560]   there could be some interesting trees out there.
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:17.000]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000]   Well, they're probably talking to other trees, right?
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.040]   They're not talking to us.
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:21.880]   And so to the extent they're talking,
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:23.160]   they're saying something interesting
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:27.960]   to some other conspecific, as opposed to us, right?
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:30.040]   And so there probably is, there may be some signal there.
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:32.680]   So there are people out there,
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:36.520]   actually it's pretty common to say that human language
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:38.440]   is special and different
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.680]   from any other animal communication system.
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:43.480]   And I just don't think the evidence
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:44.920]   is there for that claim.
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:46.040]   I think it's not obvious.
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:50.200]   We just don't know,
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:52.680]   'cause we don't speak these other communication systems
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:54.760]   until we get better.
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:57.720]   I do think there are people working on that,
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:46:58.840]   as you pointed out,
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:00.760]   people working on whale speak, for instance.
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:02.120]   That's really fascinating.
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:05.160]   - Let me ask you a wild, out there sci-fi question.
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:08.120]   If we make contact with an intelligent alien civilization
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:11.400]   and you get to meet them,
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:13.720]   how hard do you think,
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:15.080]   like how surprised would you be
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:16.920]   about their way of communicating?
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:19.880]   Do you think it would be recognizable?
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:21.400]   Maybe there's some parallels here
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:23.160]   when you go to the remote tribes.
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.400]   - I mean, I would want Dan Everett with me.
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:28.760]   He is like amazing at learning foreign languages.
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:31.320]   And so this is an amazing feat to be able to go.
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:33.240]   This is a language, Piedmont,
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:35.160]   which has no translators before him.
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:37.320]   - Oh, wow, so he just shows up?
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:39.000]   - Well, there was a guy that had been there before,
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:40.280]   but he wasn't very good.
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:43.320]   And so he learned the language far better
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:45.160]   than anyone else had learned before him.
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:48.600]   He's a very social person.
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:49.800]   I think that's a big part of it,
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:50.840]   is being able to interact.
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:52.040]   So I don't know, it kind of depends on
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:55.800]   the species from outer space,
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:47:57.800]   how much they wanna talk to us.
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:47:58.840]   - Is there something you can say
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:00.200]   about the process he follows?
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:03.800]   How do you show up to a tribe and socialize?
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:05.480]   I mean, I guess colors and counting
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:07.400]   is one of the most basic things to figure out.
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:08.360]   - Yeah, you start that.
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.760]   You actually start with objects
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:13.560]   and you just throw a stick down and say, "Stick."
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:14.760]   And then you say, "What do you call this?"
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:17.000]   And then they'll say the word for whatever.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.520]   And he says, "The standard thing to do
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:20.280]   "is to throw two sticks at two sticks."
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:22.280]   And then he learned pretty quick
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:24.760]   that there weren't any count words in this language
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:27.080]   because they didn't know this wasn't interesting.
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:27.960]   I mean, it was kind of weird.
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:29.080]   They'd say "some" or something,
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:30.280]   the same word over and over again.
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:32.040]   But that is a standard thing.
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:33.080]   You just try to...
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:36.120]   But you have to be pretty out there socially,
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:37.800]   willing to talk to random people,
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:41.320]   which these are really very different people from you.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:43.320]   And he's very social.
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:44.760]   And so I think that's a big part of this,
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:48.120]   is that's how a lot of people know a lot of languages,
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:49.960]   is they're willing to talk to other people.
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:52.760]   - That's a tough one, where you just show up knowing nothing.
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:53.800]   - Yeah, oh God.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:56.600]   - It's beautiful that humans are able to connect in that way.
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:48:57.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:48:59.880]   - You've had an incredible career
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:01.560]   exploring this fascinating topic.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:03.320]   What advice would you give to young people
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:08.200]   about how to have a career like that
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:10.760]   or a life that they can be proud of?
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:13.320]   - When you see something interesting, just go and do it.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:15.080]   I do that.
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:15.800]   That's something I do,
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:17.560]   which is kind of unusual for most people.
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:20.520]   So when I saw that Piero Han was available to go and visit,
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:23.000]   I was like, "Yes, yes, I'll go."
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.360]   And then when we couldn't go back,
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:28.200]   we had some trouble with the Brazilian government.
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.320]   There's some corrupt people there.
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:31.480]   It was very difficult to go back in there.
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:33.720]   And so I was like, "All right, I gotta find another group."
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:36.280]   And so we searched around and we were able to find the Chamani,
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:38.520]   because I wanted to keep working on this kind of problem.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:40.520]   And so we found the Chamani and just go there.
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:42.680]   I didn't really have, we didn't have content.
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:44.680]   We had a little bit of contact and brought someone.
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:48.440]   And that was, we just kind of just try things.
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:51.080]   I say it's like, a lot of that's just like ambition,
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.040]   just try to do something that other people haven't done.
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:57.240]   Just give it a shot is what I, I mean, I do that all the time.
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:49:58.360]   - I love it.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:01.240]   And I love the fact that your pursuit of fun
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:03.080]   has landed you here talking to me.
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:05.160]   This was an incredible conversation.
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:08.920]   Ted, you're just a fascinating human being.
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:10.040]   Thank you for taking a journey
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:12.120]   through human language with me today.
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:12.760]   This is awesome.
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:14.040]   - Thank you very much, Alexis.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:14.760]   It's been a pleasure.
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:17.560]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:19.000]   with Edward Gibson.

[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:31.240]   The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:33.400]   Thank you for listening.
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:35.560]   I hope to see you next time.
