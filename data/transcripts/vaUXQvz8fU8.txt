[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Getting money and investing right can be overwhelming,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.720]   I know, but the upside of financial freedom is so huge.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.800]   So today I'm gonna break down 25 investing
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.000]   and personal finance rules of thumb
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.120]   that will make managing your money simpler
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.560]   and more effective.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.280]   From the rule of 72 for doubling your investments
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040]   to the 4% rule for early retirement.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.360]   These principles will help you make smarter
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.920]   financial decisions and grow your wealth
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.160]   with a lot less stress.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   Plus, me and best-selling author Brian Feraldi
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.320]   are also gonna cover when it's important
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.240]   to break some of these rules.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.320]   I'm Chris Hutchins, this is "All The Hacks"
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.040]   and a big favor before we jump in
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.520]   is to give us a quick thumbs up
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.480]   to help others find this channel.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.620]   And if you're new here and you wanna keep upgrading
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.740]   your life, money and travel, consider subscribing.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.280]   Brian, why do you think that personal finance
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.480]   and investing are just so hard for so many people?
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.560]   - It is a very complex topic
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.240]   and it is filled with mountains of data,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.920]   but more important, mountains of emotions.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.000]   And I think that everybody has their own
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.840]   unique experience with money.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.720]   We grow up in different types of environments,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.240]   we grow with different types of parents
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.320]   and different types of role models to look to.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.040]   And as a big part of that, historically,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.820]   money, personal finance and investing,
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.360]   they haven't been subjects that have ever
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880]   been taught in school.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.520]   A lot of schools have basically said,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.040]   "You're gonna learn this from your parents
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.560]   "and you're gonna learn this from outside of the classroom."
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.320]   So because of that and because it's such an important topic
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.800]   that is emotionally charged,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.200]   I think it is a very easy topic
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.320]   to have a lot of different opinions on.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.020]   - That's why I'm really excited about this conversation
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.800]   because it can be complicated
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.220]   and I would love everyone listening
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.040]   to go become an expert and be able to uncomplicate it.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.400]   But there are a bunch of rules of thumb out there,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.360]   some of which are good, some of which are bad.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.660]   And I thought it'd be good to just run through them
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.040]   to kind of make some of this easier.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.840]   And we can give our feedback on them.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.800]   Not all of them are ones that we're gonna tell you
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.960]   you should be using, but you put together a great list.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.920]   I went and sourced some from myself,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.280]   ChatGPT, the internet to kind of make
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.480]   as much of a comprehensive list as I could
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.240]   of the rules of thumb of investing in personal finance.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.300]   So what do you say we go through them and see where it goes?
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.140]   - Absolutely.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.760]   And to your point, I absolutely love rules of thumb.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.360]   I love rules in general.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.520]   And I think that if you're a beginner on a subject,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.700]   it's essential to know the rules.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.120]   As you get more educated about that subject,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.600]   it's more important to know when to break the rules.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.340]   - Yes, and I think no matter where you are in that journey,
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.640]   this conversation will be interesting
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.680]   'cause we're gonna talk about both the basics
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.240]   and when to break it and how we do them ourselves.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.000]   So the rule I wanna start with is probably the one
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.980]   that of this entire list I kind of have heard
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.760]   for the longest, and that's the rule of 72.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.160]   - So this rule is a calculation that lets you figure out
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.560]   how long it will take approximately for your money to double
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.420]   when invested at a specific interest rate.
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.540]   So the rule of 72, you simply take the number 72,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.000]   divide it by the interest rate
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.360]   at which you are expected to grow your money.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.980]   That will give you the time period in years
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.800]   at which your money will double.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200]   So as a quick example, let's say you invest your money
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   at a 10% interest rate.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.580]   If you take 72, divide it by a 10% interest rate,
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.200]   that gives you 7.2, meaning that in 7.2 years,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.220]   you can expect your portfolio to double
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.440]   at that interest rate.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.240]   - If you were to invest at 5%, which kind of right now,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.400]   treasury rates are at, you know, about 14 years to double.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.600]   And when I looked at this rule, I was like, interesting,
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.760]   there's also a rule of 70.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.120]   - Yeah, the rule of 70 also is similar to the rule of 72.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.600]   And this actually applies more to the purchasing power
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.100]   of your investment.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.360]   So everybody knows that every year,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   the inflation rate erodes the purchasing power
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.840]   of your dollar, which is a big reason
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   why you should be investing in the first place.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.040]   And the rule of 70, very similar to the rule of 72,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.280]   and it effectively tells you how long in years
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.080]   it will be before the purchasing power
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.760]   of your portfolio is halved.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   - If we have inflation at 3%, then in 23 years,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.620]   you're gonna end up with kind of half
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.880]   the purchasing power you had.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.420]   - For anyone mathematically inclined here,
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.760]   the point at which your purchasing power has eroded in half
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.140]   is the point at which inflation
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.940]   has effectively doubled your base.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.760]   So it's the same thing.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.180]   And it turns out the reason why I think the rule of 70
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.140]   is different is purely that it's a different thing, right?
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.860]   They're talking about inflation eroding purchasing power,
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.900]   so it needed a different number.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.940]   But the reason the rule of 72,
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.300]   which I think is older than the rule of 70,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.520]   wasn't originally the rule of 70,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.160]   was actually, best I can tell,
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   because 72 is more divisible simply by more numbers.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.020]   Two, three, four, six, eight, nine, 12.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.280]   It's just an easier number to work with.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   But it turns out that the rule of 70
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.720]   is a little bit more accurate.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.480]   And so for, you could take 70 or 72,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.760]   the numbers are gonna be about the same,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.060]   but they both kind of effectively do the same thing.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.340]   How do you use this rule?
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.580]   I mean, I understand what it tells you,
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.380]   but how could someone apply this to their life?
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.420]   - The way that I think it's most useful
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.220]   is you take your current age
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.500]   and you subtract that from the year 65,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.060]   which 65 is the quote unquote standard retirement age
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.720]   that a lot of people aim towards.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.100]   So I'm 40.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.060]   If we took 65 and subtract that, that would get me,
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.820]   that means that in 25 years, I have to,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.540]   I am going to retire.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.620]   And I wanna know, well, how many times
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.140]   will my current portfolio effectively double in value
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.240]   over that time period?
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.220]   So if I'm aiming for a 10% return in my portfolio
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.660]   using the rule of 72, that tells me that every seven years,
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.580]   I can expect the value of my portfolio to double.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.740]   So I can expect during that 25 year time period,
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.740]   if I'm roughly correct,
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.940]   about three doublings of my portfolio.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.380]   So seven years from now, it'll be a 2X.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.820]   14 years from now, it'll be a 4X.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.220]   And 21 years from now, it'll be an 8X,
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.460]   the value of my portfolio.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.220]   I think that's a very good, easy mental calculation
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.340]   that I can do to figure out,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.240]   well, how big will my portfolio be in so many years?
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.300]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.820]   And I guess if you were to just take
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.940]   the interest rate minus inflation,
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.100]   you'd figure out what your,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.940]   and then use it against the rule of 72.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.900]   So let's say 10% minus 3% inflation,
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.700]   then it would take you 10 years
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.100]   to double your purchasing power.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.020]   - Which I would argue is even more important
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.240]   than doubling the value.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.100]   It's not necessarily the absolute dollars that matter.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.700]   It is what you can use those dollars
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.760]   or what you can purchase with those dollars.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.700]   So I think that's a great way to do it.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.580]   And don't forget to account for inflation.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.300]   That is something that you absolutely have to think about,
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.620]   especially when it comes to your money.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.100]   - So let's jump into some rules
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.540]   that apply to a investment portfolio
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.580]   and start with the 110 rule.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.860]   - The idea here is you take your age
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.180]   and you subtract it from the number 110.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.940]   The answer there will tell you
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.660]   what percentage of your portfolio
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.180]   you should keep in stocks or equities.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.340]   The remainder should be in bonds or cash.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.300]   So as an example, if you are 40 years old,
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.660]   110 minus 40 equals 70.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.220]   So at age 40, you should have roughly 70%
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.740]   of your portfolio devoted to the stock market.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.720]   - And do you follow that rule?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.620]   - I personally do not.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.100]   I do think this is a good rule of thumb
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.660]   and a lot of financial planners follow this rule.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.740]   A lot of target date retirement funds follow this rule.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.640]   So there's a lot of people that are following
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.100]   this kind of thinking and formula,
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.460]   whether they know it or not.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.880]   For me personally, I am extremely comfortable
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.900]   with having basically 100% of my capital
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.820]   in the stock market for a long period of time
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.180]   because it's the asset class that I know best.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.140]   And I've kind of taken this and adapted it to form my own.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.820]   So I actually more consider it
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.300]   how many years of investment,
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.420]   how many years of spending do I want in bond, in cash,
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.920]   as opposed to it being just a raw percentage
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.100]   of my portfolio.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.680]   So for me, when I am all the way up until 10 years
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.100]   from before I "retire," which is something, by the way,
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.020]   I plan on pretty much never doing,
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.220]   but if I was 10 years away from needing
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.540]   to draw down my portfolio, more than 10 years away,
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.620]   I effectively don't want anything in bonds.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.380]   I want my capital in the stock market.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.660]   As I get closer to needing to draw down my portfolio
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.300]   and use it for my living expenses,
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.700]   then I would actually devote more money
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.080]   to the bond market and to cash,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.900]   but I would do it in years of living expenses.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.520]   So the rule that I've made for myself is,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.300]   when I'm within 10 years of drawing down my portfolio,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.620]   I want effectively one year worth of living expenses
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.120]   in bonds, one year worth of living expenses in cash,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.700]   and gradually ramp both of those numbers up
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.340]   as I get closer to the drawdown period.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.820]   The reason for doing that is because
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.420]   the stock market is very volatile.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.540]   It's unpredictable what it's gonna do in the short term,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.660]   and you want to be able to use bonds and cash
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.020]   to pay for living expenses if you go for,
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.300]   if you're living through a prolonged bear market.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.140]   - That makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.540]   I also don't necessarily follow this rule,
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.460]   but I think it's really valuable for people to realize
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.540]   one thing that you just said,
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.900]   which is a lot of target date funds are doing this.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.060]   So if you look at this and say,
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.700]   I don't want to be allocated that highly to bonds right now,
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.580]   well, if your portfolio in your 401(k)
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.660]   is in a target date fund,
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.780]   you are being allocated in that way.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.900]   And the other is just to think about,
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.300]   over time, my portfolio should change, right?
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.380]   That is an important thing to consider
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.860]   for the reasons you just said,
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.740]   which I think dovetails well to the five-year rule,
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.580]   where we talk about when you shouldn't invest
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.860]   in the market and why.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.820]   - Yeah, this is one that I'm a firm believer in.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.180]   The idea here of the five-year rule
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.460]   is that you should only put money into the stock market
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.040]   that you won't need to spend,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.740]   that you know you won't need to spend
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.780]   for at least five years.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.300]   The reason dovetails with what exactly I said previously.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.260]   The stock market is unpredictable,
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.180]   especially in the short term.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.560]   I define the short term as anything less than three years.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.500]   However, if you can keep your money in the S&P 500
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.020]   for a period of five years,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.660]   the odds of you earning a positive real return,
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.660]   real meaning after the effects of inflation,
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.380]   are actually very high.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.500]   The number is about 80%.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.100]   So you have an 80% chance,
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.260]   if you can keep your money in the stock market
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.660]   for five years or longer,
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.260]   of earning a positive real return.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.780]   That to me is an acceptable level of risk to take on,
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.380]   although everybody is different.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.560]   But if you're gonna go for a shorter time period in that,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.660]   the math is just not nearly as favorable.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.200]   - Which is why in your previous example,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.380]   you wanna keep money in a safer source,
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.740]   like fixed income and bonds and treasuries,
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.820]   to cover a handful of years for that exact reason.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.260]   If holding out five years will get you back
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.160]   to a positive return 80% of the time,
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.640]   and you know you're gonna need to draw down that portfolio
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.200]   over the next five years,
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.220]   well, if you have money in other places
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.820]   that you can use to draw down,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.340]   then you can make it through whatever downturn there is.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.260]   Unfortunately, to get to 100%,
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.060]   I think it takes about 20 years.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.060]   So the five-year rule is not without some risk.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.180]   - You have to be willing to accept some level of risk
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.300]   in the time period that you need to,
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.980]   if you're gonna invest in the stock market in general.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.700]   And to your point, yeah,
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.480]   you don't wanna have to wait 20 years
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.860]   to take advantage of the power of the stock market
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.340]   to get to that 100% time
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.580]   when it is nearly guaranteed to beat inflation
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.380]   and deliver a positive real return for you.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.780]   So five years seems like a happy medium to me.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.620]   - And a good rule of thumb that you have
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.820]   for kind of just thinking about the different growth rates
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.500]   is the 10-5-3 rule.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.020]   - Yeah, if you look back historically
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.020]   at what the different asset classes
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.180]   or the major asset classes you can invest in,
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.180]   the 10-5-3 rule has hung true historically.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.240]   So this rule states that you can expect
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.540]   to earn about 10% annually from stocks,
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.820]   about 5% annually from bonds,
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.120]   and about 3% annually from cash.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.300]   It is worth noting that those are pre-tax returns,
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.700]   or rather pre, those are nominal returns,
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.520]   so they do not account for the effects of inflation.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.760]   So inflation historically in the United States
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.420]   has been about 3%,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.020]   so you can subtract those from the 10-5-3
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.140]   and get your actual rate of return
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.220]   or your spending power rate of return.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.800]   But those numbers, those 10-5-3 are decent proxies
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.840]   when you're considering modeling your portfolio.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.000]   - Which means, by the way,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.400]   that if you wanna fight 3% inflation
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.000]   and you're getting 10% from stocks,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.280]   you can still get seven,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.600]   you can get 5% from bonds,
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.320]   so you can still get two,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.280]   and from cash, you might get nothing.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.240]   And I realize I say this in a current climate
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.680]   where you can earn over 5% on your cash
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.120]   depending on where you go,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.820]   but that is not always the case.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.640]   And so there's a good chart I'll link to
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.800]   in the show notes that you sent me
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.120]   or we'll put up in the video
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.800]   with showing these numbers in real rates,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.840]   and you can see those numbers.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.200]   And the US dollar annualized return is actually negative.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.760]   - Absolutely, and to your point,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.960]   these are historic numbers
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.680]   and they're good for modeling purposes
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.040]   and thinking through what kind of returns you can expect.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.680]   But if you go through weird periods
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.400]   where interest rates are abnormally low,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.880]   like they were in the 2010s,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.520]   or periods of high inflation like we've experienced
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   in the early part of the 2020s,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.200]   obviously these rules don't hold the water.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.920]   - Another rule that we used
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.240]   back when I was running a financial planning firm,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.000]   we called it the 6% rule.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.400]   When you think about how to invest your money,
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.240]   yes, don't invest it in the market
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.000]   if you need it in the next three to five years,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.960]   but also if you have debt
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.200]   that's at an interest rate of 6% or higher,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.920]   that's probably a better investment, right?
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.640]   We talked about the stock market
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.960]   might earn after inflation,
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.560]   let's call it 7%-ish over the course of time,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.360]   but over five years,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.760]   you've got an 80% chance of getting a positive return.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.320]   When you pay off 6% debt or 10% debt or 20% debt,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.560]   that is a guaranteed return
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.440]   because you're going to be accumulating that interest
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.460]   if you don't pay it off.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.220]   And so anything over 6% for me,
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.080]   and for some people this number might be lower,
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.140]   is something that I would prioritize before investing.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.960]   - Yeah, I think that's a great rule of thumb.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.800]   I mean, to your point,
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.880]   if you can expect 5% in the longterm from bonds,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.680]   and that's what he's done roughly historically,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   but if you have a guaranteed way
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.920]   to earn a 6% return by paying off debt,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.840]   absolutely do that first.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.760]   - Yes, now the only argument that I'd say
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.360]   where that doesn't play into this case
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.400]   is depending on your cashflow needs,
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.040]   if you have 7% debt and you pay it all off,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.440]   it might not be easy to get 7% debt again.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.520]   And so I wouldn't pay off all debt over 6%
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.960]   at the expense of leaving your cashflow at zero, right?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.440]   This is how much I would pay off
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.320]   over investing in the market.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.380]   But the one nice thing about investing,
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.600]   whether it's bonds or stocks,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.040]   is that that money is liquid.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.660]   So I think a really important rule to talk about next
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.040]   is the 3-6 rule,
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.000]   because before you do any kind of investing
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.540]   or even paying off debt,
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.200]   you need to make sure you have some money to operate from.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.560]   - Yeah, this is a rule that I've heard,
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.360]   geez, since I started studying personal finance
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   over 20 years ago.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.840]   The idea that I always heard was you should have in cash
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.580]   at least three to six months worth of living expenses
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.000]   in cash at all time.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.320]   And this is effectively your emergency fund.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.720]   I think this is a decent starting point,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.560]   but I personally believe that there are actually ways
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.760]   that you can improve upon this formula,
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.740]   because not everybody is in the same situation as other.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.360]   For example, if you don't have any dependents,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.800]   and if you are in an industry
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.000]   where it is extremely easy for you to get a different job,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.240]   or if you have multiple sources of income,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   I don't think that you need to save
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.920]   much more than three months worth of living expenses.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.240]   Even that might be too much
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.160]   since you have so much ability to generate cash
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   in the future, and you don't have big needs on your cash.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   On the flip side, if you have multiple people
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.160]   that are dependent on your income,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.900]   and if you work in an industry
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.180]   that would be very hard to get a new job in,
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.560]   and if you are a single income household,
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.000]   that is a very risky position to be in,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.200]   and I think it's prudent to have
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.560]   a much bigger emergency fund than just six months.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.920]   - And I'm gonna break down your formula,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.240]   which is three months to start.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.080]   If you have dependents, add three more months,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.920]   and then depending on the industry,
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.600]   and we'll link to this and we'll put it on the screen,
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.720]   you might add zero to three months
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.120]   depending on your industry,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.360]   and then zero to three months
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.640]   depending on how many sources of income you have.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.220]   So adding more sources of income,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.660]   working in a growing non-cyclical industry,
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.060]   both things you could do to reduce your emergency fund needs.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.140]   I left off dependents
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.020]   because I don't wanna be out there encouraging people,
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.780]   "Oh, the financially prudent thing to do
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.900]   "is not have children."
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.420]   Probably is based on how much children cost, but--
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.900]   - Yeah, I can confirm that would be,
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.300]   I would have much more money today if I did not have kids.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.780]   - Yes, but I would be much less fulfilled,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.260]   and I don't regret the decision at all.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.780]   So I'm glad I have them.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.880]   It just means I need to be
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.740]   a little bit more prudent financially.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.800]   And for me, I just went through your formula,
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.640]   and I was like, "Okay, start with three."
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.480]   Have dependents?
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.600]   Yes, add three.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.640]   Industry?
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   Well, I think this may apply better to a full-time job
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.400]   because I wouldn't necessarily say
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.720]   podcasting is dying or cyclical,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.400]   but I would certainly say that being self-employed
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.660]   in an industry like this that relies on sponsors
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.040]   and partners and that kind of stuff would dial me up.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.720]   And then me and my wife just have this one company
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.960]   right now, and that company might have a couple
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.060]   different sorts of income, but it is for our household one.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.280]   So for me, I'm already at 12 months on your calculator,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.000]   and I think that even feels a little aggressive
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.600]   given I might wanna be more conservative
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   and dial that up beyond 12 months,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.920]   just given the fact that we're both doing this full-time
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.280]   with kids and there's so much variability.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   - I think that makes a whole lot of sense.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.360]   And yes, to your point, when you are content creators
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.640]   like both of us are, our incomes, my income at least,
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.280]   is extremely volatile from month to month.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.320]   It might be predictable or relatively predictable
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.000]   over the course of a year, but I can see huge changes
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.400]   in my income on a given month.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.080]   I'm guessing it's very similar for you.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.840]   - Yes, it's very dependent, and things can change quickly.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   So I think we try to have a lot more emergency fun.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.560]   Then years ago when we both worked stable jobs
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.840]   and had salaries, I was working at Google.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.200]   Like Google, I'd put in the add zero months.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.960]   We had no kids to add zero months.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.820]   Both of us were working, and we had a tenant in our house.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.260]   I was like, bam, three months.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.720]   You could argue that's too much.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.640]   And now here I am on the other side
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.700]   thinking a year might not even be enough.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.540]   So I really like this rule, but I like more
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.560]   that you've put kind of a formula together
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.520]   instead of just saying three to six,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.560]   which is a better rule of thumb than nothing.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.420]   But I don't know, what do you call a formula of thumb?
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.240]   I think I'm a big fan of the formulas of thumb.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.360]   - A framework of thumb.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.080]   - And what about when you think about that portfolio?
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.960]   So I'm assuming you set your emergency fund aside
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.480]   and you paid off your debt, how to allocate things.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.060]   Talk about the 5% rule.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.080]   The 5% rule effectively says that no more than 5%
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.080]   of your portfolio should be invested into a single stock.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.320]   And I would view that truly at the portfolio level,
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.000]   and I think portfolio, I really think it's more
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.100]   of like your net worth.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.520]   No more than 5% of your net worth should be invested
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.960]   in a single stock.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.040]   So I think that's a decent starting point.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.160]   It does build in some risk mitigation strategies,
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.700]   but this one is one that I would probably push back against
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.380]   because I know people that have far more than 5%
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.060]   of their portfolio invested in a single stock
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.900]   and they feel very comfortable doing so.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.980]   So this one to me is a little bit squishy
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.520]   and it's more about your personality
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.180]   than is necessarily a rule.
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.540]   - For me, this rule is more like 1%, right, for me.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.380]   Though I would say, if you're invested entirely in the S&P,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.100]   I wonder right now what percent of your net worth
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.360]   is in Microsoft, Apple, and NVIDIA.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.100]   Like it's gotta be a significant percentage,
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.220]   even though you might not think that you're concentrated.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.460]   - Yeah, those three companies,
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.340]   Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA,
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.580]   currently, I just saw this statistic there,
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.260]   they make up 21% of the value of the entire index.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.500]   And if you're in the NASDAQ, it's even higher.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.700]   So yeah, you are breaking this rule
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.500]   if you are literally investing in the S&P 500.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.780]   - Yeah, virtually I'm also doing other international
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.560]   and emerging markets.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.740]   So I don't think I'm personally breaking this rule,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.580]   but I understand where it could be broken.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.100]   How do you generally think about this
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.100]   as someone who probably advocates for stock investing
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.380]   more than the average person?
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.740]   A lot of people talking about personal finance
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.420]   advocate for just index funds,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.140]   and we did a whole episode on this.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.220]   So I'll just defer.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.900]   People can go back and listen to that episode
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.360]   to think about your framework for buying stocks.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.100]   But how do you think about concentration
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.100]   and diversification in that way?
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.080]   - Yep, so I personally, my personal rule of thumb
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.460]   that I use for my portfolio is 15%.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.060]   I would not be comfortable having more than 15%
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.100]   of my net worth into an individual stock,
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.960]   but I will throw out the caveat there
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.620]   that the way that I personally invest
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.420]   is I am a long-term buy and hold investor.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.620]   So for a company to become 15% of my portfolio,
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.020]   it would have had to earn its way in there.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.960]   I would never put 15% in from the get-go.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.300]   I would probably stick to under 5% of my capital.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.740]   And then if it just so happened to triple from there
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.180]   and become 15%,
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.580]   I would be personally comfortable with doing that.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.740]   So my personal, I call this my sweet sleep well
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.540]   at night number is 15%, but it's different for everybody.
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.420]   - I think the way you think about stock investing
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.300]   is very different than a lot of people, right?
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.420]   We did an episode on this investing checklist you use.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   The companies that would make their way past 5% for you
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.340]   are not fly-by-night penny stock kind of thing, right?
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.340]   These are much more solid stock investments than that.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.600]   Correct?
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.760]   I mean, I am personally a huge believer
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.280]   that there are companies out there
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.000]   that single companies are less risky than the entire market,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.320]   but I might be alone in that opinion.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.680]   - So part of the process I used,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.400]   I mentioned was I just went to chat GPT.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.640]   I was like, hey, what rules of thumb are we missing?
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.160]   Here's the ones we have.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.080]   And a couple of them were actually ones,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.520]   one of them in particular was one that I actually use.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.940]   I just didn't think of it like this,
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.760]   which was the 10% rule,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.240]   which is just keep less than 10% of your portfolio
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.800]   in kind of risky or alternative assets.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.720]   And this is something I've talked about
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.120]   with many guests in the past.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   It's something I particularly do,
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.200]   whether for you that's, you know,
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.520]   more non-framework driven stock investing,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.600]   just this company's cool,
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.500]   let's not do any research and invest in it,
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.440]   or angel investments, or, you know,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.400]   investing in other projects or wineries or whatever it is,
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.440]   keeping it under 10% is a rule I've long held.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.360]   - I would even throw cryptocurrencies in there
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.840]   or alternative assets like that.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.120]   So yeah, keeping less than 10% of your net worth
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.760]   in those types of investments, that makes sense to me.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.480]   - The other one is one that I can't speak much to,
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.360]   but chat GPT said it and I was like,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.520]   oh, it's kind of interesting.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.480]   So I'll just share it,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.300]   which is the one third rule for real estate,
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.160]   which is limiting your real estate investments
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.240]   to one third of your net worth,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.440]   which is primarily for maintaining
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.880]   liquidity and diversification.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.080]   I kind of like this rule just because I think,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.280]   you know, real estate is one of those types of investments
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.500]   that, you know, absent doing it through REITs,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.900]   liquidity is tough and you're often tying yourself up
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.360]   into a single property or a single unit
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.760]   and having more than a third of your net worth in that
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.480]   even seems a little risky to me
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.400]   if it's one building or one property.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.320]   But I like having a rule that reminds you
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.440]   not to over diversify and maybe limit the percentage
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.320]   of your portfolio in something that isn't liquid.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.720]   - Yeah, and to point out there,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.440]   the key word in that rule there is though,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.000]   is real estate investment.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.580]   I'm assuming that rule does not include your primary home.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.520]   - I would assume that's probably fair
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.840]   'cause I know a lot of people who have a meaningful chunk
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.000]   of their net worth in their primary residence.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.200]   But, you know, when I think about net worth,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.060]   I also think about like the net value of the home.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.600]   So if you buy a $400,000 home
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.880]   and you mortgage $300,000 of it,
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.520]   you only really have $100,000 of skin in the game.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.320]   Now, for many people that might be their entire net worth,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.880]   but I just wanna remind people that if you're like,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.280]   "Ooh, I have a $500,000 net worth and a $400,000 home,"
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.160]   that doesn't mean that your home is 80% of your net worth,
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.180]   but I would think of it as your home minus your mortgage
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.200]   if you have one, that is a percentage of your net worth.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.020]   So I think about it a little bit differently,
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.680]   but now we're kind of going a little bit more in the weeds.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.160]   - Well, I think that's right in the name.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.560]   Net worth, not worth, net worth.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.040]   - Yes, net home, net worth.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.600]   What about the 1% rule?
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.260]   - So this rule relates to investment fees.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.240]   And this one I would say applies mostly historically
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   and it needs to be modified,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.320]   given what's happening with broker costs
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.440]   and general expenses investments more recently.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.800]   But the idea here is that the investment fees
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.440]   that you should pay on all of your investments
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.560]   all put together should not exceed 1%
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.200]   of your portfolio annually.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.440]   If you look back in time,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   it was fairly common for mutual funds
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.720]   to have a 1% management fee.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.960]   So if you had $100,000 in a mutual fund,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.000]   they would take $1,000 per year in management fees.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.220]   And I think that both of us think that this rule
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.520]   is actually a little bit high,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.840]   given where prices have gone recently.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.160]   - Yeah, I don't know about you,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.200]   but I personally, there are a lot of financial advisors
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.880]   and planners who charge a 1% fee,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.480]   and that's not inclusive
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.960]   of the underlying expense ratios of the funds,
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.120]   which are often not that expensive
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.680]   and sometimes very, very expensive.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   I think paying a 1% fee is wild for your portfolio.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.240]   It's not something I advocate ever for.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.320]   I don't know about how you feel
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.520]   about hiring an advisor at 1%.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.240]   I'm okay with hiring an advisor.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.160]   I would just make sure that I understood
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.920]   how that advisor is getting paid.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.760]   I've talked to so many people that have an advisor
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.640]   and you press them, well, how do they get paid?
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.000]   And I get a blank stare like,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.840]   wow, we've never talked about that before.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.000]   So it's really important that if you do have an advisor,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.040]   you fully understand how you get paid.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.520]   And one thing that's worth noting about this 1% rule,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.920]   I would argue that a lot of people
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.240]   are actually breaking it inadvertently.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.760]   The one way that they can do so
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   is if they look at the fees that they're paying
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.680]   on their 401(k).
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.280]   So many people, when it comes to contributing
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   to their 401(k), their options for what they can invest in
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.280]   are very limited.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.440]   And those are set by the companies that they work for.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.920]   And because of that, some of the fees on 401(k)s
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.600]   can break that 1% number.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.240]   I've actually even seen cases where 401(k)s
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.160]   have funds in them that have loads.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.440]   And loads is like an upfront sales charge
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.080]   for just putting money into a fund.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.040]   Given where we are today and where costs are,
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.080]   there's absolutely no reason to pay that level
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.840]   of annual investment fee, even through a 401(k).
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.240]   So check what you're paying on your 401(k).
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.840]   You might be surprised at what you learn.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.640]   - There used to be a website, and if I find it,
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.800]   I will put it in the show notes,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.760]   where you could go look up your 401(k) fees.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.720]   Some people upload their plan docs
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.600]   and they get kind of summarized, and it's wild.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.800]   It can be really, really expensive.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.720]   To the point that there are some 401(k)s out there
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.440]   that unless you're getting a match from your employer,
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.760]   they're just not worth contributing to.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.720]   That's one.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.960]   Another one is a lot of legacy 401(k)s,
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.880]   you might be sitting on four or five 401(k)s
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.640]   from all your past employers.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.260]   If your current employer has great low fee options,
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.280]   you can roll all those past 401(k)s into your current 401(k),
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.680]   or you can roll them into an IRA.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.840]   And so I think if you're in a high fee 401(k),
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.700]   you can't move it while you're employed at that company.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.460]   And so an option is to just not invest in it.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.200]   And we're gonna talk about that in a second.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.160]   But if it's an old 401(k), you can get out of it.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.760]   If it's an old 401(k) with low fees,
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.400]   my Google 401(k) had such incredibly low fees
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.960]   that I just left it in there for 10 years after
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.440]   until I finally set up a solo 401(k) recently,
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.920]   and then I just rolled it into that.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.400]   But it took 10 years because Google had negotiated
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.560]   such great deal at Vanguard that the fees were super low.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.400]   - There you go.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.520]   There's an example of you knew
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.520]   what the expense ratio you were paying
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.680]   with your old 401(k) and you just chose to kept it
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.000]   because you knew it was low.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.200]   But if you're paying a very high fee,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.400]   it is completely worth it to take the time,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.160]   roll it in to an IRA,
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.540]   or roll it into something that you control
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.000]   where you can control the fees.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.160]   - Yeah, another place where this can be tricky
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.400]   is with 529s.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.560]   If you're saving for college for your kids,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.720]   there are a lot of states
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.180]   that have much better pricing than others.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.280]   And so I should do an episode on this.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.040]   So this is not well-researched,
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.780]   but I think Nevada and Utah have pretty low fees
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.340]   and they're pretty popular funds,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.000]   but you don't actually have to invest
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.300]   in the fund from your state.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.840]   And so certain states have a little bit of tax advantage.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.640]   And if you live in one of those states,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.000]   probably the tax advantage might be worth
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   investing in your states for 529.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.640]   But if you don't have any special advantage,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.480]   you can pick the 529 in another state
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.920]   that has better expense ratios and fund costs
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.440]   and fund selection and all that.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.540]   And so for us, I think our 529s are through Wealthfront
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.360]   and the cost of those funds,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.120]   I think the underlying fund is either in Nevada or Utah,
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.680]   not in California, despite that we live here.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.760]   And that comes back to an important point you made
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.640]   that I'll just reiterate.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   I harped on the 1% fee as a AUM fee for advisors.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.080]   And I'm not a fan of that fee
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.920]   because I just think 1% is way too much.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.140]   But like you said, I'm actually even less a fan
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.760]   of the 0% financial advisor fee
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.640]   because it usually ends up being two, three, 4% fee
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.480]   on mutual funds and high expense ratios
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.160]   and loads and all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.640]   So, I don't like really expensive advisors
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.360]   and I don't like free advisors.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.720]   And somewhere in the middle, there are solutions
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.120]   where maybe you're just paying a fixed annual fee
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.160]   for financial planning and you're not paying
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   a big AUM fee for your assets,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.640]   or you're relying on software.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.520]   I've talked about Wealthfront a lot.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.340]   The value software provides me doing all the rebalancing,
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.940]   all the tax loss harvesting,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.860]   and making me not have to think about it.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.700]   I'm happy to pay 0.25% for that, but I would never pay 1%.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.460]   - When it comes to advisors, I'm a big fan of advisors
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.980]   that charge an hourly rate.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.140]   If they charge 200 or $300 per hour,
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.180]   not only will that make you much more efficient
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.560]   with the time that you spend from,
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.620]   but you are actually seeing the bill
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.100]   that they are giving you by the end.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.220]   And just being able to see that bill will make you focus
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.180]   on what costs are we paying for this.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.540]   - And I'm a big fan of working with CFPs
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.180]   because if you're a certified financial planner,
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.420]   you usually always follow the fiduciary standard,
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.220]   which means that you are acting
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.380]   in your client's best interest.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.460]   So if you're talking to advisors, that's a great question.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.420]   Are you a fiduciary?
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.320]   And if not, I'm not sure I wanna work with you.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.700]   Okay, so that is the 1% rule.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.180]   Let's talk about, I just talked about rebalancing.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.980]   And so one other rule I found
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.340]   that I thought was worth covering is the 5/25 rule.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.380]   And I don't think this is a very common rule
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.340]   'cause it was one of those, talk to ChadGBT.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.300]   Hey, do you have any more?
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   Hey, do you have any more?
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.140]   Hey, do you have any more?
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.460]   And finally it came up.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.120]   But I thought it was interesting
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.860]   because someone must come across this.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.820]   And the idea is if your portfolio deviates
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.480]   by more than either 5% in absolute terms
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   or 25% in relative terms from your target allocation,
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.660]   you wanna rebalance.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.420]   And I think I get it, right?
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.260]   If you're trying to be in 60/40 and you're at 65,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.060]   you might wanna rebalance.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.660]   I've found, and in the analysis we did
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.080]   when I ran our financial planning firm,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.460]   that if you just rebalance every six, 12 months,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.980]   you're gonna be fine.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.900]   And maybe also any major market corrections, right?
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.820]   If the market drops 20, 30%, right?
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.180]   That might be a trigger that you'll be misallocated.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.440]   But other than that,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.800]   I don't know if this is one where I would follow.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.520]   - Yeah, when it comes to rebalancing,
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.120]   I'm actually a bigger fan of doing it on a timed basis.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.320]   I've heard, like you've said, every six months or 12 months.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.420]   I've actually heard that every two years
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.400]   or even three years is perfectly fine.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.280]   The more important point is to occasionally check in
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.520]   on your asset allocation and make changes
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.680]   when you think you should.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.560]   - Not just when you should
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.860]   'cause it's out of track from where you want it,
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.760]   but because your situation has changed.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.820]   Your risk levels changed.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.640]   Just like you mentioned,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.620]   your emergency fund changes over time.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.400]   Your risk tolerance is something that I think
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.260]   people should be checking in regularly on also, right?
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.040]   If you have no kids, you have no dependents,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.580]   lots of income, stable job,
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.760]   you could be a little bit more risky
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.040]   than if you're not in that circumstance.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.340]   - Absolutely, and this is especially true
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.740]   when you're going from your 20s to your 30s to your 40s.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.440]   It's often very common for people to get married,
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.460]   to buy a house, to have kids, and dependents,
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.860]   to get further parents to become older.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.640]   So yes, check in on these rules of thumb often.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.120]   - And one other thing that's interesting,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.000]   when you're checking in over time, right?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.400]   You said 30s, 40s, 50s.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.340]   I've always wanted a rule of thumb
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.140]   that helped you figure out, how am I doing?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.760]   And I didn't know one existed
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.180]   until I saw you share the net worth rule,
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.940]   and, or I guess the age times income over 10 rule.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.280]   Can you talk about this one?
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.100]   - Yeah, this one was popularized by the wonderful book,
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.400]   "The Millionaire Next Door,"
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.380]   which came out in 1995 or 1996.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.820]   The idea here is to figure out
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.900]   what your net worth should be,
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.740]   given your current age and income.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   So the way that this rule works is you take your age,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.280]   and you multiply it by your pre-tax income,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.320]   and then you divide that total by 10.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.820]   This is a rough proxy for what your net worth should be.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.660]   It was an example, let's say you were 50 years old,
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.760]   and you make $100,000 per year.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.460]   Multiply those two numbers together, you get 5 million.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.700]   You divide that by 10, and you get 500,000.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.140]   So your net worth should be $500,000.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.780]   And then from there, you can actually compare it
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.540]   to what your net worth is to figure out
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.260]   if you are doing better than the average person,
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.620]   given your age and income,
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.320]   or worse than the average person, given your age and income.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.040]   One caveat to this rule is it really falls apart
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.500]   for people that are under the age of 25,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.180]   who haven't had a chance to actually enter the workforce
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.680]   and start saving for money.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.260]   So I would say this rule is most useful past the age of 30.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.220]   - And I liked how there's a further part of it,
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.500]   which is if your net worth is double what it should be,
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.220]   you're a, what is it, prodigious accumulator of wealth.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.060]   There are kind of terms in this triangle.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.260]   And if it's less than half,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.660]   you're an under accumulator of wealth.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.460]   And you could track it out and say,
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.620]   have I moved from one of these categories to another?
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.460]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   But I like the idea that there is a target out there
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.300]   that is relatively easy for you to calculate,
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.020]   to figure out what my net worth should be.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.500]   And hopefully, given what you find,
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.900]   you can actually be really excited about your situation
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.360]   or potentially have some changes on the horizon.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.380]   - Yeah, and when it comes to saving for the future,
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.620]   let's talk about the 15% rule.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.780]   - Yeah, the idea here is that you should set aside
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:28.060]   at least 15% of your salary for retirement.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.980]   If you'll actually look back historically,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.060]   most personal finance books
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.380]   that were written prior to the year 2000
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.140]   really harped on the 10% rule,
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.700]   saying that you should save 10%
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.420]   of your income for retirement.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.660]   This has been updated in recent years to 15%
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.020]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.460]   One of the bigger ones is the fact that pensions
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.060]   and defined benefit plans
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.940]   have really gone the way of the wayside.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.140]   And some data that actually came in from Fidelity
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.820]   showed that the average retiree
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.820]   needs to, in retirement, generate about 55 to 80%
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.580]   of their pre-retirement income
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.060]   in order for them to maintain their lifestyle.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.140]   So based on that bandwidth of actual spending,
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.240]   you need to save about 15% of your salary to get there.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.660]   - And they base that, I think,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.340]   on saving from mid-20s to mid-60s, right?
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.740]   - Yes, 25 to 67 was the savings period.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   - So if you're starting this at 40 and you've never saved,
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.780]   number probably needs to be higher.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.280]   If you're starting right around that time,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.180]   it's a good benchmark.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.740]   Now, obviously, this is saving for retirement.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.840]   There's also a rule, which is the 50/30/20 rule,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.380]   that kind of might seem at the outset in conflict,
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.120]   but as you dig in, is not, right?
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.140]   - Yeah, so the idea of the 50/30/20 rule
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.340]   is to allocate 50% of your income to your needs,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.660]   so housing, food, transportation,
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:58.620]   30% to your wants, entertainment, vacation, luxuries,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.140]   and the remaining 20% should go to savings and investment.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.540]   Now, of that 20%, we already said that roughly 15%
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.700]   should be set aside for your retirement.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.300]   In that 15%, though, that could include an employer match.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.980]   So if your employer has a generous match,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.700]   not all that 15% has to come from you.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.940]   And the difference between that 20% savings
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.740]   and that 15% for retirement,
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.580]   that is what you're gonna use for things like a down payment
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.520]   on a house or paying off debt.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.560]   - Obviously, the 50/30/20 rule
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.540]   is your after-tax income, right?
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.620]   If you make $100,000, you can't spend 50/30 and 20 of it
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.340]   because some percentage will go to taxes.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.500]   Is the 15% rule 15% of your salary
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.740]   or 50% of your after-tax income?
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.580]   - Salary.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.460]   - That's an important difference.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.100]   So 15% of your pre-tax salary to retirement,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.300]   20% of your income to savings,
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.260]   your after-tax income to savings.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.480]   And the 15% rule is kind of loosely
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.120]   also based off the 80% rule, right?
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.820]   - Yeah, the idea of the 80% rule
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.940]   is that you are gonna wanna replace about 80%
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.660]   of your pre-retirement income during retirement.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.460]   Studies generally show that retirees spend less
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.540]   on everything than when they are working
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.820]   with the only caveat being healthcare.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.820]   There's a lot of reasons for that.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.660]   Often in retirement, your house is paid off,
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.100]   your kids are out of the home,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.220]   so you're only paying for two people to eat and live
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.900]   as opposed to three or four people.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.360]   So, and generally speaking, the older you get,
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.920]   the more likely you are to just stay home
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.280]   and not really go out.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:36.260]   So aiming to replace about 80% of your pre-retirement income
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.840]   is a good goal to shoot for.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.560]   - I actually did an episode with Bill Perkins
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.040]   who wrote a book called "Die With Zero"
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.840]   that I'm sure you're familiar with.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.040]   It was episode 91, and we talked a lot about this.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.080]   And he says one of the biggest problems
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.040]   is that people assume they're gonna spend
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.760]   more money in retirement 'cause they think,
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.600]   "Wow, when I have all this free time,
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.180]   "I'm gonna be traveling around the world.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.240]   "I'm gonna be doing all this."
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.360]   And it turns out they don't, right?
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.640]   The data shows that it's actually less money
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.680]   you spend in retirement,
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.100]   which leads to people really over-saving.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.800]   And so I think if you're doing any of your projections
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.640]   and you're trying to figure out
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.480]   how much money you need for retirement,
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.640]   yes, I understand the desire to be super conservative
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.580]   and dial that number up
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.840]   so that you don't end up with nothing.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.880]   But the flip side is you could be way over dialing that
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.160]   and missing out on spending money
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.360]   during years of your life
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.160]   where you can actually do the things you wanna do.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.240]   And so I would say, go back and listen to that episode
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.780]   if you are interested because it really changed my outlook
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.100]   on spending more than just about anything I've ever done.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.140]   - I am right there with you.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.140]   That might be my favorite episode of all the hacks ever.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.980]   And Bill Perkins has done more to change my spending mindset
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.460]   than almost anybody else.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.300]   I think you and I are both cut from the same cloth
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.740]   where fire is extremely attractive to us,
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.180]   like retire early, gain financial independence.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.900]   And he was the first one to push back
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.280]   in a very logical way
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.960]   and really change my thoughts about spending.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.100]   - Yes, it's episode 91, allthehacks.com/91.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.420]   Don't listen to it with your children.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.060]   Bill has a passion for colorful language.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.780]   You also mentioned employer match.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.220]   Let's talk about that rule.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.660]   - Yeah, when it comes to 401(k),
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.700]   I've actually become convinced that the 401(k)s
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:20.700]   are not a slam dunk that they are sold to most people at.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.220]   Some 401(k)s can have really high fees.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.940]   Some can have very limited choices.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.500]   And with the 401(k),
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.580]   you are essentially locking your money up
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.060]   until you are 59 and a half.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.660]   So there are liquidity issues with a 401(k).
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.860]   However, there is one thing with a 401(k)
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.340]   that I am an absolute believer in,
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.060]   and that is if you have an employer match,
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.140]   always, always put enough money in
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.980]   to take advantage of the full match.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.020]   That is literally free money,
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.460]   and it would be a complete waste to say no to it.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.260]   - Yes, I totally agree.
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.900]   I've only had an employer match once in my career,
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.180]   and the number of people, even at Google,
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.820]   sophisticated, smart people
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.860]   that weren't taking advantage of it was just wild.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.260]   And Google finally, I learned historically,
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.460]   just said we're defaulting everyone to opt-in.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.780]   And no matter how many programs you can do,
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.260]   how many info sessions,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.140]   the fastest way to get people to retire
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.980]   or contribute to their retirement account
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.260]   was to just automatically default them to do it.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.180]   - Nick Maggiuli also did a bunch of posts on this
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.020]   that we can link to in the show notes,
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.180]   kind of breaking down the tax value
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.940]   of putting money in your 401(k).
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.860]   Do you remember about how much value that he found?
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.500]   - Yeah, that was an eye-opening thing.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.420]   Nick Maggiuli is a great follow on the internet,
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.780]   but he actually did a study that showed
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.620]   what is the value, the annualized return value
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.780]   of the tax advantage that you get from the 401(k),
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   and he actually calculated that it's about 0.8% annualized.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.180]   So putting your money into a tax advantage 401(k)
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:58.180]   saves you about, adds 0.8% to your return every given year.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.900]   Now, that's not nothing,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.080]   especially when you compound it
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.340]   over a longer period of time,
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.940]   but I was under the assumption
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.620]   that the tax benefits were much higher than that,
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.540]   which is just one more reason
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.740]   why you should really think about
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.420]   should you max out your 401(k),
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   whereas previously I thought it was an automatic thing
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.620]   everyone must do.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.740]   - I actually just did the math.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.820]   I took 72 and divided it by eight
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.020]   because we've got the rule.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.340]   We've got our rule of 72 and I got nine,
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.940]   but it's actually 0.8.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.940]   So 90 years to double your money is the value of the 401(k).
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.700]   I think this is also really state dependent, right?
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.160]   If you live in California,
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.020]   the highest tax bracket between all the different state,
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.360]   local, federal taxes can be over 50%.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.100]   I imagine if someone is at the 52, 53%
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.220]   marginal tax bracket in California,
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.740]   the advantage of putting pre-tax money in a 401(k)
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.940]   might be a bit higher,
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.020]   but I'll link to the post
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.060]   so people can go see what assumptions went into it.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:58.880]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.980]   If you live in a high tax state
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.020]   and you have a high enough income
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.880]   that you are paying really the highest tax rates possible,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.100]   it can make total sense to max out a 401(k)
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.020]   if for no other reason
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.500]   than you likely have plenty of money to do so.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.300]   The point there though is to look into that
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.800]   because it's not the slam dunk
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.140]   that I initially thought it was.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.100]   - Next, I wanna talk about a rule
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.700]   that we've talked about on the show a lot,
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.140]   I think anyone in the FIRE community is familiar with,
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.000]   and that's the 4% rule.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.520]   - Yeah, this is the granddaddy of all rules of thumb.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.300]   And this is the idea of the 4% rule
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.340]   is this is the amount of your portfolio
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:34.140]   that you can withdraw each year during retirement.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.960]   So if you have a million dollar portfolio
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.360]   in the first year of retirement,
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.360]   you can safely withdraw $40,000 or 4% of that number
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.760]   and you can have a very high confidence rate
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.080]   that that money will last you throughout your retirement.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.200]   - Yes, and I think one common misconception here
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.900]   is that the study this was based on, the Trinity study,
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.000]   did not test this for people retiring at 35 years old.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.400]   I believe it was like a 30 year time horizon.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.140]   So if you are thinking, wow, I've saved up enough money
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.920]   that I can live off 4% of my savings,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.680]   I can stop working at 40
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.320]   and it'll cover me for the next 60 years.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.480]   That is not what the study covered, right?
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.920]   - Absolutely, and there are a bazillion different caveats
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.600]   that going into solving the,
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.860]   what level can I really retire at?
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.200]   The length that you're gonna be living off
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.600]   your portfolio matters.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.640]   There's something called sequence of return risk,
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.200]   meaning that the first few years after you retire,
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.340]   what the market does or your rate of return
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.840]   really impacts that.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.380]   There's also, you have to factor in,
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.880]   what are interest rates during the period that you retire?
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.380]   For example, during the 2010s,
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.980]   the return on bonds was effectively zero
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.660]   or pretty darn close to zero,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.980]   where that study really assumed that bonds
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.100]   had a more normalized interest rate of three to 5%.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.420]   So the 4% rule, I think, is a fantastic study point,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.140]   but when you're actually making a should I retire decision,
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.540]   there's a bunch of other factors you need to consider.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.360]   - This is a really fun topic
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.600]   because I think a lot of people want a simple rule of thumb
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.880]   for how much money do I need to save
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.600]   to kind of have financial freedom.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.680]   And I think financial freedom
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.000]   and be able to live off your savings forever
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.120]   are a slightly different number
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.400]   because you and I have found careers doing things
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.240]   that we enjoy doing
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.840]   that we have no interest in stopping doing,
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.960]   but they're very different from what we've done in the past.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.080]   And I would consider myself in the financial freedom.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.420]   It's like, I have financial freedom
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.760]   because I found a job I love
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.040]   that I could generate income from.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.160]   Yes, it might be unstable,
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.320]   so I need a little bit more of an emergency fund,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.680]   but I think that's something that people should consider.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.740]   And the inverse of it
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.720]   has also been called the 25X rule, right?
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.420]   It's one over 0.04 turns into 25,
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.200]   the idea being you could look at it as,
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.340]   I need enough money to live off 4%
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.520]   or I need enough money to be 25 times my annual expenses.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.360]   - Yep, exactly.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.600]   So if you need to spend 100K per year,
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.340]   multiply by 25, that's $2.5 million
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.460]   that you need before you can "retire."
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.960]   - Now, that doesn't factor in
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.200]   that 80% spending in retirement.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.760]   So maybe you could argue the 4% rule works a little better
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.600]   because you could say,
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.040]   okay, how much do I need
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.580]   where 4% equals my retirement spending,
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.480]   which might for $100,000 now be $80,000.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.840]   But there's a guy who runs a blog
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.480]   called Early Retirement Now
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.840]   who has dove into safe withdrawal rates
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.220]   more than maybe anyone in the world.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.640]   I don't know if you would agree.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.080]   He has a 61-part series on his website
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.000]   about safe withdrawal rates.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.080]   And I wanna have him on the show
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.720]   because I love the work he's done.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.400]   Are you familiar with all that?
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.240]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.480]   His name is Karsten, aka Big Earn,
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.120]   and he has gone in-depth on this.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.640]   He was actually a big part of when I was writing my book.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.600]   He did a whole bunch of the data analysis
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.560]   for some of the charts that I made.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.840]   So I'm a big fan of his.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.960]   - Yes, yeah, and by the way,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.920]   when I say 61-part, I don't mean like 61 paragraphs.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.960]   Each one of these parts is like a multi-thousand-word essay.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.280]   So it's gonna take a lot of prep
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.800]   going into that interview with Karsten
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.660]   because we could go down hours and hours of conversation.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.200]   But we'll dive a little bit deeper
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.000]   into what assumptions there are.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.480]   Should it really be the 3.5% rule or the 2% rule
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.720]   or how do you think about that?
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.760]   But I will save that for another episode.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.640]   Last, I just wanna rapid fire through a few other rules
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.960]   that you found, I found, the internet found, when I created.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.480]   They aren't gonna take as much of a conversation,
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.700]   but let's just jump in, the 24/10 rule.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.440]   - Yeah, this rule relates to when you are buying a car.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.780]   So the idea here is you wanna make sure
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.100]   that you're making a down payment of at least 20%.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.720]   You are financing it for no more than four years,
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.440]   and you wanna ensure that the monthly payment
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.000]   that you're taking on is no more than 10% of your income,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.240]   hence the 24/10 rule.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.760]   So my reaction here is I'm down with 20%,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.020]   though maybe not necessary.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.800]   I'm definitely down with the don't go over 10%
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.040]   of your income for the monthly payment, that makes sense.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.520]   And then the four year, I kinda get the concept,
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.280]   but I've never adhered to it.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.680]   I've always, fortunately, I guess, always bought a vehicle
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.080]   in a period of time where interest rates were low,
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.400]   and at a low interest rate,
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.040]   I'll take it for as long as possible.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.560]   I'm someone who historically has not sold a car
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.480]   until it's been 10 plus years old,
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.920]   so maybe I'm a slightly different camp,
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.040]   but especially if you're gonna put 20% down,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.560]   I'm not sure I know why the four years is as necessary,
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.600]   but I don't know what your experience here is.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.040]   - I think this is generally speaking a good rule
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.920]   for the general population, but like any of these rules,
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.840]   you need to know how it applies to your specific situation.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.660]   Personally, I've never had a car loan.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.380]   I've only, my rule is I only pay a cash for cars
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.720]   when I buy them, which you could say,
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.640]   which you could argue, given the low interest rates
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.280]   that you've paid, is suboptimal in its own way.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.040]   So I view this rule with more as what is your appetite
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.320]   and comfort level with debt personally than anything else?
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.160]   - Yes, and I think we had a conversation
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.080]   in our last episode about debt and mortgages
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.440]   that I'll encourage people to listen to
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.360]   because the decision to take on debt in some people's minds
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.600]   is a mathematical one, in others it's emotional,
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.340]   and in probably almost everyone it's a mix of the both.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.540]   But you and I had a good conversation about that last time
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.980]   because we kind of take different approaches here.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:30.860]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.780]   Personal finance is personal.
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.060]   - The debt to income ratio is another one.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.300]   - Yeah, the idea here is that your total debt payments
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:42.020]   should not exceed 36% of your gross income.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.420]   So when you're thinking about debts,
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.100]   think about all of the type of debts
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.180]   that you're paying interest on.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.580]   That could be housing, that could be related to education,
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.320]   that could be related to a car that we just talked about.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.840]   You wanna make sure that any payments that you're making
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.180]   that are related to debt instruments,
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.960]   they do not exceed 36% of your gross income.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.720]   - The primary reason that this rule matters
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.120]   is that most lenders are looking at a rule
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.600]   somewhere around this when they're making lending decisions.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.980]   So it's often the reason that you need to sell a home
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.000]   to buy another home because the sum
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.440]   of those mortgage payments together
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.320]   would put you over this limit.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.980]   And so it's more of something that matters
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.940]   when you're about to take on larger pieces of debt,
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.660]   whether it's a mortgage or an auto loan
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.100]   or something like that.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.580]   But in general, I don't monitor this regularly.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.420]   I don't know if you do.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.960]   I don't even know if I know what mine is.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.800]   - I don't either.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.660]   I can tell you that when I was very early in my career,
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.360]   I used to track my numbers like a hawk.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.300]   As my net worth has grown, I've become more lax
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.620]   with my rules because I have more wiggle room
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.980]   just given how much of an emergency fund
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.340]   I personally keep.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.160]   So I think it depends on where you are
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.500]   in the stages of your career.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.660]   - Yeah, the final AI rule I liked
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.320]   was the three to 4% rule for salary.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.940]   And the idea is given inflation,
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.900]   you should be increasing your salary three to 4% every year.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.460]   I don't know if this is a rule of thumb, but I liked it.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.180]   I've had a couple of conversations in the past
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.260]   about salary negotiations.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.340]   And I just think in general,
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.020]   people under advocate for themselves financially at work.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.380]   And I think that every year you should be sitting down
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.020]   with your manager or your boss and saying,
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.980]   "Hey, what is the next stage of my role?
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.160]   "And what do you need to see to get there?"
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.540]   And have them give you the blueprint
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.140]   so that you can come back every performance period
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.300]   and say, "You told me that if I were to do X, Y, and Z,
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.320]   "I would get to level here, and now I wanna do this."
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.340]   Now, those increases should hopefully be more
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.460]   than three to 4%.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.180]   But at a bare minimum, a cost of living adjustment
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.420]   or inflation adjustment of three to 4%
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.900]   is something you should advocate for.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.260]   - Yeah, that can be a quick Google search, too.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.340]   What is the inflation rate over the last year
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.540]   in the geography that I live in?
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:57.860]   And you should use that as an absolute basis for,
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.000]   "This isn't even a raise.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.700]   "This is you paying me effectively
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.300]   "the same amount of money you did last year."
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.500]   So it's not me getting richer.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.540]   It's just me being able to buy the things
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.980]   that I need to be able to buy.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.700]   - I love the idea if you work for a company
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.580]   that sells a product with a price to go to your manager
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:17.860]   and say, "Hey, our prices have increased 15%
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.420]   "in the last 12 months, so where's my salary increase?"
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.140]   You know, you can't argue that cost of living
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.020]   hasn't gone up and inflation hasn't existed
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.220]   'cause we've raised our prices.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.260]   I don't know how that would go.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.020]   If anyone's done that, I'm curious.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:33.660]   But that's a tactic I would probably try to use.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.860]   Last two quick ones.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.380]   One I found on the internet just searching around,
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.460]   and I named it the 850 rule because it didn't have a name.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.500]   But the idea was when a major appliance in your house breaks
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:51.020]   buy a new one if the appliance is eight years old or more
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.820]   or the repair costs more than half the replacement cost,
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.020]   the 50%.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.860]   And this is fridges, TVs, dishwashers.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.340]   It says, you know, something breaks, get an estimate,
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.840]   find out what the replacement cost is,
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.900]   look at how old it is,
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.460]   and make a quick call on replacing it.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.980]   This one is great because we've had circumstances
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.820]   where things have broken and we debated this
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.420]   and I just didn't really have a framework or a thought
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.100]   and I went down a long rabbit hole
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.500]   that rounding error is probably not that many dollars.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.220]   And so I actually like now, now I have a thing.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:24.020]   Dishwasher breaks, I got an answer.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:24.860]   - I love it.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.300]   I wonder if there's a similar rule for cars
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.700]   because cars is an interesting one
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:30.460]   given how repairs can often be in thousands of dollars.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.160]   - Yeah, I will look around.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.340]   If I find one, I'll share it in the future.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.000]   The last one is a rule I just made up
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.200]   right before we started talking
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.360]   because I felt like none of these rules
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.520]   covered the cashback points world of credit cards,
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.780]   which is something that is near and dear to my heart.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.400]   And I'm gonna call it the 432 rule.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.900]   And the idea is you should be aiming
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.120]   for at least 4% cash back on the area you spend the most in,
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.400]   3% on everything else,
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.960]   and you should never accept lower than 2%.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.880]   So I think that even with a one or two card strategy,
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.240]   you can achieve this.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.280]   And so I don't think it means you need to go
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.800]   build up a wallet of 20 or 30 credit cards,
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   but no one should be earning less than 2%
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.520]   in cash or points equivalent
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.940]   because there are flat 2% cards.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.720]   And if this Robin Hood card ever comes out,
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.840]   it'll be a flat 3% card.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.680]   And so people should never accept lower than that.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.520]   But it is not hard,
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.560]   whether it's going simple
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.480]   with Bank of America premium rewards
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.800]   or going complicated with 15 cards.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.120]   I think the average has to be above 3%.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.520]   And unless you're not spending a lot
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.880]   and it's not worth your time,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.160]   it's pretty easy to increase this number.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.080]   - Love that.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.720]   The only rule there that I follow is the 1.5% rule.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.040]   I thought I was doing good with a 1.5% cash back card,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.600]   but following the Chris Hutchins rule,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.680]   I'm clearly not up to top par.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.440]   - Yeah, just to make sure people understand
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.980]   that I'm not talking about the rate of earning,
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.160]   but the rate of value.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.120]   Well, I'm gonna assume that that's a Chase Freedom Unlimited
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.340]   and that you also maybe have a Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.940]   or a Chase Sapphire Reserve.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.680]   And if that's the case,
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.920]   you can redeem those one and a half chase points
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.640]   at a minimum in the Chase Portal
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.200]   at one and a half cents with the reserve,
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.400]   which means you're getting about 2.25%.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.360]   So if that's you,
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.880]   then I'm gonna say you cleared the lower threshold,
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.240]   but you could probably still do better.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.080]   Glad I made it.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.960]   All right, this has been fantastic.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.800]   There were a couple of topics
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.600]   we actually bounced around talking about today
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.760]   before we settled on rules of thumb.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.480]   So I'm gonna throw it out there to listeners
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.700]   for the next time.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.540]   There are three things
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.160]   that I think would be fun conversations.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.800]   And if people have opinions, let me know,
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.640]   whether we talk about stock-based compensation,
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.280]   whether we talk about reading financial statements
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.320]   or sourcing investment ideas.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.820]   So those are three things I'll throw out there
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.360]   that we talked about having an episode on.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.600]   And I'm curious what people think we should cover next.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.440]   But until then,
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.920]   where can people stay on top of everything
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.760]   you're writing and doing?
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.440]   - I'm on all the social platforms,
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.960]   Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.080]   So if you type my name in, Brian Feraldi,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:10.920]   you will find me.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.280]   And my website is longtermmindset.co.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.100]   - Awesome.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.680]   Brian, thanks so much for being here.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.760]   - Chris, awesome to be here.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.000]   Thanks for having me back.
