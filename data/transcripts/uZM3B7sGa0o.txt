[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Sarah Nelson, a listener from Tallahassee, writes in,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   "Pastor John, I've been reading Joe Rigney's book, The Things of Earth,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and reflecting on the correlation between our limits as creatures
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and our love for God, seeing as we are unable to love an infinite
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   God as finite beings, Rigney speaks of the alternative
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   of loving God supremely, fully, and in a way ever
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   expanding. How would you describe or define
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   the practical differences between these two categories? How do I know if I'm feeling
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   false guilt for trying to love God infinitely, which goes against
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   my creaturely design, versus a right guilt for not loving
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   God supremely and fully?"
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Well, I think I'm going to say something
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   that will at first be discouraging to Sarah.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Hang on. If I understand what she's struggling with,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   that will probably be the case.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And yet, I think what I'm going to say will in the end be
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   massively encouraging to her and the rest of us
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   who share her struggle. So hang on. Let's clarify what
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   she's struggling with because I'm not sure what you just said went by pretty fast
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and it might be too complicated for some of our listeners to grasp the distinction
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   she's making. She points out that the finite human
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   being cannot love in a qualitatively
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   infinite way. And I say qualitatively
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   because temporally our love
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   will be infinite. That is, it will last forever.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It will be without end. But our love for God
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   will never correspond to God's love in the sense of being
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   infinite in a quality or kind. And therefore,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   she points out rightly that
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   we should not feel guilty for falling short
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   of infiniteness when God has designed us to be finite.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Well taken. Good point. On the other hand, she says
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that God has called us to love him supremely,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   which I take to mean more than we
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   love anything else or anyone else, and that certainly is
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   true. Jesus says, "Whoever loves mother or father more than me
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   or son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." And then she
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   asks how she can know whether any particular
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   guilt feeling that she has about not loving God is false
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   guilt for falling short of doing what
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   she was never designed to do, or
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   real guilt, which is a falling short of precisely what
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   she was designed to do and commanded to do, namely love God supremely. Now,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   before I answer, let me make the problem worse.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And that's where I think the discouragement may come.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Jesus didn't just command us to love God supremely
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   more than we love anything else. He commanded
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   us to love God totally or comprehensively.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That is, with all of our heart.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   To love him not just with more of our heart
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   than we love anything else, but to love God with all of our heart.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   all your soul, all your mind." This is the great first
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   commandment, and the second is like it, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So now, Sarah has to add this to her
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   guilt struggle. She will not only want to know if she's
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   falling short of loving God supremely, she
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   will also want to know if she's falling short of loving
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   God comprehensively or totally, with all her heart, not just
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   95% of her heart while she loves
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   the rest of the things in the world with 5%, which might have given
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   some comfort, but now it won't because 95% is
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   not all of her heart, and Jesus says you're supposed to love God with all of your
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   heart. Now, it's precisely
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   this difficulty, for me anyway, of measuring
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   our love for God in this way that determines
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   how I'm going to answer Sarah's question and help
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   her with her struggle, because it's mine, too. Frankly,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I don't know how to sort through what
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   aspects of my failure to love God are false
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   guilt and what aspects are true guilt. The Bible teaches
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   me that the human heart, my heart, is
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   desperately sick. Who can
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   know it? That's Jeremiah 17:9. "The heart is deceitful
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   above all things, and desperately sick. Who
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   can understand it?" So it seems to me that the Bible itself
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   does not hold out very much hope to us
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   that we can know ourselves accurately at these
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   complicated and profound levels, to which Sarah
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   might respond, "Well, that's not encouraging. Must I
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   live then with constant sense of uncertainty
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and vague guilt feelings and not enjoy peace
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   with God?" To which my answer is
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   no, you are not condemned to that. God does not want you
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   to live without peace. He wants you to enjoy sweet
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   contentment and a profound sense of assurance
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   that he loves you and accepts you and forgives you
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   and will receive you in the end. And the pathway
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   -- now here's getting at the essence of my answer -- the pathway
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   that he gives to that peace is not
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   by bestowing on you or me
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   an infallible capacity to discern our own errors,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   but a gospel that cleanses
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   so deeply that it remedies the very
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   sins you can't even see or feel.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   For example, Psalm 19
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   verse 12, "Who can discern his errors?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Declare me innocent of hidden
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   faults." Now, isn't the point of
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Psalm 19, 12, that verse
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   that we will never get to the bottom of
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   our sin and our guilt so that we can
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   know it well enough to discern all that is false guilt and all that is
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   true guilt and confess it perfectly? That whole approach is just
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   helpless. It is for me, anyway, after 70 years. So
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the remedy that he says doesn't lie
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   in that kind of discernment. It lies
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   in the declaration of God that we are innocent,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   even of the measures of guilt that we cannot
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   discern, and there are always some. You don't know your
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   heart. Nobody knows the depth of his own sinfulness.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   "Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent of hidden faults."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's what the gospel offer in Christ does,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   declares us innocent of all faults, including the ones we can't see.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Here's the way Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 4
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   verse 4, "I'm not aware of anything against myself, but
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I'm not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   who judges me." Now, he didn't lose his assurance when he said that,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   because he knows what the Lord is going to judge him on the basis of.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Isn't one of the points of saying that
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   my awareness of
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   all my faults, or my non-awareness of my
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   faults, is not decisive in whether I will
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   be saved? The Lord will make that determination,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and he has given us the gospel that Christ died
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   for our sins, even the ones we can't see, so that we
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   might be forgiven and justified. Here's the way Paul says
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   it positively and with sweeping
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   glory. I love this verse. Acts 13,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   38, and 39, "Let it be known to you,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   therefore, brothers, sisters, let it be known to you,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   therefore, that through this man, Jesus,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   him everyone who believes is justified
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   from everything from which you
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   could not be justified by the law of Moses."
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Everything. The one who believes in
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Jesus is justified from everything
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   if you believe in Jesus. So, I think what this
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   means, practically now, for
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   our friend is that we should daily
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   appropriate the gospel of the blood of Jesus to
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   cleanse our conscience and to give us peace with God, and then
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   from that hope-filled position, we
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   should be on the alert, and if we detect
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   our love for any created person or any created thing
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   rising to compete with our love for God, we should
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   repent and ask for forgiveness and fly
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   to Jesus and seek help to see
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   God more clearly and love Him more
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   dearly. Yeah, honest, realistic, and hopeful
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   insights. Thank you, Pastor John. And Sarah, thank you for the great question.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Well, if this episode was too short and you want some more listening material
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   for your commute or for your time at the gym, you can find our audio feeds and you can
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   browse and search our past episodes all online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, should the local church work alongside a college campus
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   outreach? Are they doing two different things, and are these two
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   in competition with one another? I'll ask Pastor John that
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   question on Friday, "How the Local Church and Campus Ministry Should Relate."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   We'll see you then.
