[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   - One subject that we haven't talked about
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.600]   on this podcast previously,
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080]   but is of tremendous interest to people
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.160]   is traumatic brain injury or concussion,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.920]   even mild concussion.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.520]   And before we were recording today,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.000]   we were talking about football,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.840]   but just wanna remind people that football
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.760]   is just one instance of an opportunity
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.480]   to get a concussion or traumatic brain injury.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.180]   Most traumatic brain injury and concussion
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.880]   is not due to football.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.920]   It just gets a lot of the attention,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.540]   but you've got bicycle accidents, car accidents,
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.900]   playground accidents.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.300]   Maybe you could list off a few more,
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.860]   but how common is TBI in concussion?
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.700]   And maybe you could just perhaps list out
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.780]   some of the other situations where you see a lot of this,
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.920]   that it's a bit more cryptic
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.900]   that people wouldn't necessarily think that sport
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.260]   or that population gets TBI, but they do.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.500]   - Yeah, I think concussion is much more prevalent
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.860]   than we realize, and the numbers have gone up and up,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.620]   not because it's becoming more common,
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.500]   it's just that it's becoming more recognized.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.820]   And I think we underestimated and trivialized
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.280]   sort of what a concussion is,
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.140]   that it's just something that is,
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.480]   you're gonna recover from it.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.760]   I mean, still the old school thinking
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.980]   by a lot of neurologists is that everyone gets better
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.580]   within a couple of months.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.140]   Just wait it out and you'll get better.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340]   That's just the normal time course of concussion.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.060]   But as we've studied it more,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.260]   we realized that there's actually quite a large percentage
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.780]   of people who a year out, they're still suffering problems.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.900]   They still feel like they're not mentally clear
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.020]   and they still are sensitive to light
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.440]   and they still feel a little dizzy.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.160]   And just a host of symptoms that just one year later,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.300]   after a concussion where they didn't even lose
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.400]   consciousness, that's something that they may not
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.980]   have even talked to their doctor about is lingering.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.500]   And so it's a real,
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.740]   we call this persistent post-concussion syndrome
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.580]   and that's the most worrisome to me
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.940]   because it is true that most concussions will recover.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.020]   Luckily the brain is incredibly resilient,
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.380]   incredibly plastic and it will heal itself.
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.180]   But there are a lot of patients where it just persists
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.700]   and those are the most worrisome to me
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.580]   because we don't have very good interventions
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.060]   to try and help that.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.120]   And I don't think we take these patients very seriously
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.640]   when they're complaining of something that seems very vague
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.960]   and not very specific to most doctors.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.000]   - What do you tell a patient who comes in
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and clearly had a concussion, mild or severe concussion,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.520]   maybe car accident, maybe a sports injury,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.600]   maybe they were knocked out cold, maybe not,
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.480]   but they're having some headaches, some photophobia,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.840]   sensitivity to light, just feeling not right.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.540]   I've had a couple of these, unfortunately,
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.140]   and you just feel off, you don't feel quite right.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.300]   And some of that manifests as focus issues.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.200]   This was some years ago, I like to think I'm through it.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.440]   I've had scans and I'm good, so thank goodness.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.940]   But what do you tell them besides don't get another one?
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.700]   - Yeah, well, first of all, I explain what a concussion is.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.900]   What I found in neurology,
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.180]   a lot of what patients wanna know is just,
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.600]   they just wanna understand their problem,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.180]   not walking in expecting a cure,
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.260]   just understanding what it is,
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.460]   having someone understand what happened to them
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.800]   is very helpful and comforting.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.500]   So what we mean by concussion,
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.580]   and in the clinical world, we use mild traumatic brain injury
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.640]   kind of synonymously with concussion.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.540]   It basically is a tearing of axons.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.020]   The brain cells have these long fibers
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.900]   that communicate with each other and they're called axons.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.460]   And when the brain violently moves forward and backwards,
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.900]   if you're in a car accident and you have your seatbelt on
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.820]   and you suddenly hit, you go from 50 to zero,
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.220]   your head violently goes forward
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.480]   and violently goes backwards.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.380]   And that angular force actually tears
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.980]   and stretches axons in the brain.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.660]   So if you've had a concussion, you have torn some axons.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.300]   I mean, luckily we have billions of them.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.420]   And so if you tear a couple of thousand,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.620]   you will recover, but you have torn axons.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.860]   It's a real neurological, it's a real brain injury,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.380]   even if you haven't lost consciousness
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.420]   and you've only had symptoms for a couple of days.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.740]   But there's a correlation.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.700]   The longer you've lost consciousness
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.300]   and the longer your symptoms last,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.220]   the more axons you've torn.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.740]   There's kind of a direct relationship between the two.
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.860]   So the mechanism is these torn axons.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.460]   So now, nerves don't communicate with each other
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.060]   and the brain, different brain regions
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.140]   are not communicating with each other.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.900]   So, and it turns out the most common place
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.220]   for axons to tear is in the frontal lobes.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.420]   And so now we talked about all these things
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.260]   that the frontal lobes do to orchestrate
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.100]   the rest of the brain.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.580]   Well, it doesn't, it has some injured pathways.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.820]   And that's why a lot of the symptoms that patients have
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.780]   are these kind of mild executive symptoms.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.100]   This mental fogginess that they're describing
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.900]   is this ability, just this inability to get things done.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.060]   They don't lose knowledge of who they,
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.860]   they don't forget their name or forget where they live
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.980]   or lose memories from the past or anything like that.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.780]   But they just, they don't officially get things done
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.820]   as well as they used to.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.660]   And it only takes a little bit of a drop, right?
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.660]   People think you have to have a big drop in performance
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.460]   to have it have a real life impact.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.300]   Just a 1% drop and you're having a hard time
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.580]   doing your podcast or teaching a lecture
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.460]   or whatever you might do.
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.460]   - A 1% drop sounds like a frighteningly small change
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.220]   required to negatively impact life.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.660]   So how about a poor night's sleep?
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.340]   I mean, what kind of drop in prefrontal cortical function
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.700]   are we looking at from, let's say,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.660]   I normally get seven or eight hours or six to eight hours
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.780]   and I suddenly only get three or four.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.260]   Are we talking a significant detriment?
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.620]   - I do think so.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.620]   I do think that, yeah, that it is significant,
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.340]   this poor night's sleep.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.300]   And we all notice that.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.020]   I mean, it's very obvious.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.500]   I mean, and you know, it's hard to sort of quantify.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.740]   I'm a baseball fan, so I can quantify it.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.220]   Like if you think about it in a pitcher
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.980]   and how fast they throw, you know, a small drop for them,
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.540]   someone who's throwing a hundred miles an hour,
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.620]   just a small drop turns them, you know,
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.540]   from really elite to someone mediocre.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.180]   Maybe it's more of a 10% drop,
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.060]   but it's still relatively small drop can have a huge impact.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.700]   I think people think that just because
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.580]   you're a little bit off, that's not gonna,
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.540]   that's not a big deal.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.500]   You kind of work through it.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.740]   And that's what most doctors say.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.300]   You just plow through it, just work your way through it.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.380]   You're gonna get better.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.900]   And as opposed to saying,
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.780]   yeah, you really had a brain injury.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.020]   This is what happened.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.580]   We need to rehabilitate you.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.620]   Just like we would do
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.340]   if you tore your anterior cruciate ligament.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.420]   I don't know why tearing your cruciate ligament
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.740]   or your Achilles tendon gets more interest
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.140]   than tearing axons in your brain.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.900]   It's amazing to me that there's more emphasis
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.900]   on orthopedic injuries than brain injuries.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.100]   - Yeah, I don't know why that is either.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.460]   I think the brain is mysterious enough
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.420]   that most people and many clinicians
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.500]   just kind of back away with hands raised.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.940]   But if you are in the field of neurology or psychiatry,
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.220]   I suppose that then one has officially signed on
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.660]   to try and resolve these matters.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.620]   So for somebody that has a traumatic brain injury
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.500]   or low-level concussion, excuse me,
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.020]   would part of the primary advice
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.780]   be to try and get one's sleep as good as possible?
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.300]   Given that sleep deprivation can compound
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.460]   traumatic brain injury-induced deficits in working memory.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.300]   And who knows?
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.820]   Maybe a good portion of the deficits in working memory
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.140]   due to traumatic brain injury and concussion
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.500]   is because of the sleep deprivation that it can cause.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.620]   So it can get circular.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.540]   - Not only that, but one of the most common symptoms
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.420]   that my patients with concussion have
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.100]   is their sleep is disruptive.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.300]   And that's true in neurology.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.260]   It's fascinating.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.460]   Almost every neurological disorder,
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.820]   my patients complain of their sleep.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.780]   And I started asking, not a lot of neurologists
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.140]   ask you how you sleep.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.020]   But I remember back from my residency,
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.260]   one of the first things my attending would do
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.380]   when we got to the ward is, "How'd you sleep last night?"
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.980]   And it's just across the board.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.940]   Patients are not falling asleep.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.380]   They're not staying asleep.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.460]   We still don't understand why just brain injury does that.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.380]   So almost every concussion patient says,
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.580]   "I'm not sleeping well,"
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.100]   which then compounds the problem.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.180]   So optimizing sleep, obviously, optimizing nutrition.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.220]   There's a question about activity.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.740]   It used to be that we used to recommend,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.060]   you had a concussion, you should don't go to work,
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.780]   just take it easy for a while.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.620]   Don't exercise.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.100]   - Keep the blood strong.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.940]   - But now it's the idea
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.780]   is that you should really get up and moving.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.340]   You gotta do what you can tolerate.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.660]   You don't wanna give yourself more of a headache
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.980]   or more light sensitivity.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.580]   But as much as you can tolerate
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.580]   is the thought these days about sort of promoting recovery
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.460]   and then really getting your brain back working.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.100]   I think a lot of my patients,
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.500]   they're off from work for a couple of weeks
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.580]   and they feel fine
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.140]   and they think they're pretty much normal.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.900]   And then the first day of work is a complete disaster
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.940]   because until you actually test it in real life,
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.180]   you don't know what kind of troubles you have.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.900]   So I don't recommend going back full steam,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.220]   but I do recommend going back,
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.140]   trying to build up these skills again.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.100]   And then I think we need to develop therapies
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.860]   that people will use.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.580]   Things like goal management training,
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.220]   which involves a therapist
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.900]   and health insurance doesn't pay for this.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.900]   So 99% of my patients don't get any help
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.940]   by any kind of intervention, unfortunately.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.540]   But now we talked about technology,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.780]   things like Brain HQ.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.300]   Do you know about Brain HQ?
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.020]   So Mike Merzenich,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.300]   which I know you've talked about with Eddie,
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.620]   developed a company called Posit Science
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.660]   where it developed these brain training games
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.220]   that can help improve specific cognitive functions.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.900]   And they're very easy to do because they're online
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.220]   and there's science behind them and you can do them.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.660]   So in that way,
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.940]   you don't have a therapist in your room,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.300]   but you can online sort of do these sort of things
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.900]   that are targeting specific mechanisms
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.580]   to try to improve the kind of things
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.740]   that we think are impaired by concussion.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.180]   And I'd like to see more patients get started
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.380]   on some of those things.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.740]   Importantly, if you go on the web
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.580]   and just say I'll do brain training,
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.380]   you'll be overwhelmed with things
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.060]   and you don't know what works and what doesn't work.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.260]   - Yeah, I think the work that Merzenich
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.180]   and colleagues have done,
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.380]   and we'll provide a link to that.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.020]   I don't have any financial stake in his work
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.380]   or products trainings that is,
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.620]   but I will say I think Mike's work has been tremendous.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.180]   I mean, he is so far ahead of the curve.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.600]   (upbeat music)
