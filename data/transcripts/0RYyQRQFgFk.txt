[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.020]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.300]   Today, we are discussing mental training and visualization.
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.700]   Mental training and visualization
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.080]   is a fascinating process that has been shown
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.420]   over and over again in now hundreds of studies
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.340]   to improve our ability to learn anything.
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.900]   When I say anything, I mean the ability to learn music,
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.980]   the ability to learn and perform mathematics,
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.000]   the ability to learn and perform motor skills in sport,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.420]   in dance, across essentially all domains.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.300]   The other incredible thing
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.260]   about mental training and visualization
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.360]   is that you'll soon see when you go into the literature,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.700]   that is the scientific studies
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.540]   on mental training and visualization,
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.760]   you quickly realize that it does not take
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.900]   a lot of mental training and visualization
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.580]   in order to get better at anything.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.840]   However, that mental training and visualization
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.940]   has to be performed in a very specific way.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.260]   And today we will discuss exactly how to do
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.300]   mental training and visualization in the specific ways
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.980]   that allow it to compliment the actual performance
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.520]   of a motor or cognitive skill
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.900]   to allow you to learn more quickly and to consolidate,
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.880]   that is to keep that information in mind and body
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.340]   so that you can perform those cognitive tasks,
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.380]   music tasks, motor tasks, et cetera,
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.620]   for long periods of time
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.580]   without ever forgetting how to do them.
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.820]   All of mental training and visualization
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.400]   relies on what I consider really the holy grail
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.780]   of our brain and nervous system,
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.380]   and that's neuroplasticity.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.300]   Neuroplasticity is our nervous system,
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.180]   which of course includes the brain, the spinal cord,
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300]   and all the connections between the brain and spinal cord
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.060]   and the organs and tissues of the body,
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.460]   and then all the neural connections
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.980]   back from the organs and tissues of the body
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.220]   to the brain and spinal cord,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.760]   so the whole thing in both directions,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.820]   has the ability to change in response to experience
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.000]   in ways that are adaptive,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.940]   that is, that allows us to do things
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.720]   that we could not do before,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.400]   and by doing those things
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.860]   or by being able to perform those mental operations,
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.400]   we can do better in the world that we live in.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.020]   We can perform new tasks, we can think new thoughts,
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.080]   we can come up with novel solutions
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.140]   to preexisting problems that before really vexed us
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.640]   and that we couldn't overcome,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.000]   all of that is considered neuroplasticity.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640]   So today, what I'm going to cover
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.380]   is a brief summary of what neuroplasticity is,
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.020]   that is, how it occurs in the brain and body.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.860]   This is extremely important to understand
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.660]   if you're going to use mental training and visualization.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.740]   Then I'm going to talk about
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.580]   what happens in our brain and body
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.880]   when we do mental visualization in a dedicated way.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.760]   Many people have heard, perhaps,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.880]   that when you imagine something happening,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.340]   that your brain doesn't know the difference
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.640]   between that imagination of the thing happening
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.900]   and the real thing happening.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.580]   Turns out that is not true, it is simply not true.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.020]   However, there is somewhat of an equivalence
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.660]   between a real experience and an imagined experience.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.480]   And we'll talk about the difference between those
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.140]   and how that can be leveraged
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.980]   in order to get the most out of mental training
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.900]   and visualization.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.340]   Then I will cover exactly which types of mental training
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.680]   and visualization work best across all domains,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.220]   meaning for music learning, mathematics, solving puzzles,
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.180]   motor learning, sports performance, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.180]   to really allow you a template in which you can plug in
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.740]   or designate what you're going to do each day
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.000]   for a brief period of time
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.260]   in order to accelerate your learning in whatever you choose.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.360]   And then I'm going to go into a bit of what happens
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.860]   in the brains of different types of people.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.680]   These different types of people that I'm referring to
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.300]   are people who have more or less of a natural ability
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.700]   to imagine things and visualize them,
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.580]   because it turns out that we vary tremendously
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.080]   from one individual to the next
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.740]   in terms of our ability to mentally visualize
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.940]   and imagine things and our ability to get better at that
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.780]   over time.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.860]   And the good news is anyone can get better
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.860]   at mental training and visualization
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.540]   in ways that can serve them well.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.700]   I'll also briefly touch on the fact that certain people,
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.980]   in particular people on the autism spectrum,
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.500]   as well as people with synesthesia,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.100]   which is the combining of different perceptual experiences.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.580]   So you may be one of these people,
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.540]   or you may have heard of people that, for instance,
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.780]   when they think of a number,
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.540]   they also just naturally spontaneously think of a color
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.620]   and vice versa.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.620]   Talk about how that relates to mental imagery
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.420]   and visualization and the creative process
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.180]   and problem solving in general.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.060]   And then finally,
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.300]   what I'll do is I'll recap mental training and visualization
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.060]   from the standpoint of how best to apply
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.620]   mental training and visualization
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.740]   according to specific challenges,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.420]   things like challenges with public speaking
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.360]   or challenges with sports performance
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.780]   or challenges with test taking performance,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.720]   challenges with essentially anything
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.860]   that will allow you to build specific mental training
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.580]   and visualization practices that are brief,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.140]   that are supported by neuroscience studies,
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.700]   and that are highly effective.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.120]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.540]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.640]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.000]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.340]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.020]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.660]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.060]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.300]   that has everything you need,
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.060]   meaning sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.220]   but nothing that you don't, meaning no sugar.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.340]   And it has the sodium, magnesium, potassium,
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.340]   and the ideal ratios for hydrating
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.960]   and providing electrolytes to the cells
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.040]   and tissues of your body.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.940]   So I use Element in my water.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.860]   When I wake up, I like to hydrate right away,
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.260]   so I'll have an Element packet
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.980]   and about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.440]   I tend to do the same while I exercise,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.620]   which I typically do in the morning,
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.740]   sometimes in the afternoon,
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.500]   and I'll drink another one throughout the day.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.380]   The great thing about Element is it also tastes terrific.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.520]   I particularly like the watermelon flavor,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.980]   but frankly, I like all the flavors just mixed into,
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.780]   again, about 16 to 32 ounces of water.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.800]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.120]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.620]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.880]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.360]   which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.260]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.860]   Maui Nui spent nearly a decade
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.860]   building a USDA-certified wild harvesting system
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.880]   to help balance deer populations on the island of Maui.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.080]   The solution they built is extremely powerful
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.300]   because it turns the proliferation of an invasive species
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   into a wide range of nutrient-dense products,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.480]   from butcher cuts,
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.760]   so venison steaks and ground venison, et cetera,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.960]   to organ meats, bone broth, and jerky.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.580]   I really love all of their products,
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.560]   so I love the venison steaks and the ground venison,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.540]   and their bone broth is fantastic.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.980]   It has an unmatched 25 grams of protein per 100 calories,
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.540]   so it's very high-density, high-quality protein per calorie.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.340]   So if you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.580]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.320]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.460]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.480]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.820]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.820]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.740]   I've talked many times before in this podcast
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.260]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.540]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.180]   Now, one of the key features to getting a good night's sleep
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.140]   is making sure that you get the temperature
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.520]   of the environment you sleep in right.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.320]   That's because in order to fall asleep
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.140]   and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.880]   your core body temperature needs to drop
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.740]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.540]   Conversely, in order to wake up in the morning
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.500]   feeling refreshed and ready to go,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.420]   your core body temperature needs to go up
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.300]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.740]   And of course, you can adjust the temperature
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.360]   of the room that you sleep in.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.180]   I do hope that people are doing that,
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.340]   but adjusting the temperature of your mattress
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.540]   and your direct sleeping environment is also key.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.060]   And with Eight Sleep, it makes it very easy
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.840]   to program the temperature of that mattress
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.140]   and sleep environment, not just throughout the night,
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.040]   but for specific phases of the night.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.820]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.800]   well over a year ago,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.100]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.500]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.120]   Let's talk about mental training and visualization.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.660]   Now, perhaps surprisingly, mental training and visualization
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.700]   has been studied since the late 1800s.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.340]   There's actually a paper published in 1880 by Galton
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.060]   called "The Statistics of Mental Imagery."
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.580]   So long ago, people were quantifying
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.500]   and trying to understand how is it that people come up
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.100]   with mental images and how they can apply that
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.100]   to learning things more quickly and more stably over time.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.020]   Now, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.340]   mental training and visualization relies on a process
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.080]   that we call neuroplasticity.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.160]   Neuroplasticity is a term that many people have heard
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.480]   and it encompasses many different things.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.040]   So broadly speaking,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.200]   neuroplasticity includes developmental plasticity,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.960]   which is the sort of plasticity that occurs
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.440]   between about birth and age 25.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.300]   And that can be summarized very easily as passive plasticity.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.100]   In other words, the sorts of changes that happen
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.780]   in one's nervous system simply by engaging in the world
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.400]   and experiencing life as a child, as a young adult,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.140]   as an adolescent, and as a 22, 23, 24-year-old, et cetera.
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.220]   Now, of course, of course, of course,
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.180]   it is not the case that on your 25th birthday,
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.220]   you close out passive developmental plasticity
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.700]   and start engaging in the other type of neuroplasticity,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.540]   which is adult neuroplasticity.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.940]   It's a gradual tapering off of developmental plasticity
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.620]   that occurs between age zero and 25.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.300]   And for some people, it might occur somewhere around 26.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.460]   For other people around 23.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.000]   When we say 25, we're really just talking
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.960]   about the average age in which passive plasticity tapers off.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.580]   However, starting fairly early in adolescence
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.820]   and extending all the way out into one's 80s or 90s
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.140]   or hundreds, should one live that long,
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.620]   is the other form of neuroplasticity,
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.940]   which is adult neuroplasticity.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.300]   Adult neuroplasticity is very different
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.020]   than developmental plasticity
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.940]   because it is the sort of plasticity that one can direct
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.820]   towards one's own specific desired learning.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.740]   So if we wanted to get a little bit technical here
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.660]   for sake of clarity, not for sake of confusion,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.420]   we would say adult plasticity
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.540]   is really about self-directed adaptive plasticity.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.780]   And the reason we call it that
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.340]   as opposed to something else,
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.540]   we're simply adult plasticity,
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.820]   is that there are many different forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.320]   There is, for instance, maladaptive neuroplasticity
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.700]   that occurs if one gets a really hard head hit
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.660]   and concussion, there will be changes
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.220]   to the brain and nervous system,
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.240]   but those changes to the brain and nervous system
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.120]   do not allow it to perform better.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.340]   In fact, it often impairs the brain and nervous system's
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.980]   ability to function and therefore is maladaptive.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.820]   So I don't want to get overly wordy
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.140]   with a number of different terms here,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.580]   but I do think it's important to understand
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.540]   that we have developmental plasticity,
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.980]   again, in which the brain and nervous system changes
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.040]   simply in response to experiencing specific things
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.340]   for better or worse.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.300]   And there's adult self-directed adaptive plasticity
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.880]   in which one can direct specific changes
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.740]   in terms of learning things cognitively
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.000]   or learning things in terms of motor function,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.940]   so sport, dance, et cetera, or a combination of the two.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.120]   Now, just to really clarify what I mean by developmental
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.820]   versus self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.260]   I mentioned that self-directed adaptive plasticity
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.380]   actually can start in adolescence, right?
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.860]   Even though there's ongoing developmental plasticity,
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.260]   I mean, let's be really direct.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.000]   The brain of a 14-year-old is very different
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.840]   than the brain of that same individual
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.860]   when that person is 21
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.420]   because there's ongoing developmental plasticity.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.300]   However, starting at about adolescence,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.140]   we can all start to decide what it is that we want to learn
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.940]   and engage in self-directed adaptive plasticity.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.340]   Now, the way to engage self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.000]   regardless of whether or not you're a 13-year-old,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.840]   14-year-old, or you're a 90-year-old, or anywhere in between,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.900]   is that it requires two things.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.880]   The first thing it requires is focused, dedicated attention
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.840]   to the thing that you're trying to learn.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.860]   That's the first step.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.520]   And that actually triggers a number of different chemical
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.840]   and electrical processes in the brain
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.860]   that are often associated with agitation and frustration.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.100]   Believe it or not, the agitation and frustration
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.280]   is a reflection of the release of specific chemicals,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.420]   in particular norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.060]   also called noradrenaline and adrenaline
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.340]   in the brain and body,
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.260]   that creates this discomfort
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.700]   and this heightened level of alertness and attention
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.380]   that many of us don't like and tend to back away from,
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.440]   but it is exactly that chemical,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.540]   or I should say neurochemical milieu,
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.220]   which signals to the neurons, the nerve cells in the brain
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.600]   and elsewhere in the body that something needs to change.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.140]   Because if you think about it,
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.640]   if you can do something perfectly,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.440]   or if you try and do something
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.540]   and it doesn't cause any neurochemical change
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.060]   in your brain and body,
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.820]   well, then there's no reason for your brain
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.540]   and its connections with the body to change
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.840]   in any particular way, okay?
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.300]   So you need focused, dedicated attention
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.600]   to the thing that you're trying to learn.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.060]   It's often accompanied by agitation, frustration, et cetera.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.060]   So that's perfectly normal.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.920]   In fact, that's a signal that things are going right,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.600]   meaning they're headed towards learning,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.680]   but there's a second component that's really required
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.640]   for self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.000]   and that's periods of deep rest,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.600]   in particular, a good night's sleep in particular
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.140]   on the night that follows that focused attention
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.760]   to the thing you're trying to learn.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.340]   There are now hundreds of studies
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.520]   in both animal models and in humans
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.280]   showing that it is really during sleep
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.720]   and other states of deep relaxation,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.220]   things like meditation and non-sleep deep rest,
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.280]   which I've talked about before on this podcast,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.880]   but really during our main night of sleep,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.920]   that the rewiring of neural connections,
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.360]   that is the actual neuroplasticity takes place.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.000]   So the verb neuroplasticity,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.760]   the rearrangement of connections between neurons
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.960]   really occurs during sleep,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.020]   in particular on the first night
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.360]   following an attempt to learn something
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.220]   through this focused attention.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.360]   Now, developmental plasticity, which is passive,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.400]   also requires good sleep.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.000]   It's slightly different, or frankly, it's a lot different
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.880]   in terms of the underlying mechanisms
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.000]   than self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.760]   but because today we're mainly talking about
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.380]   how to learn faster through mental training
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.000]   and visualization, and that really maps more closely
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.720]   onto self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.480]   just really want to emphasize this two-step process.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.920]   There has to be focused, dedicated attention,
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.160]   and then there needs to be sleep,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.260]   and in particular, sleep on the first night
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.720]   following that training.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.160]   Now, should you have the unfortunate experience
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.560]   of getting woken up in the middle of the night
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.700]   following, trying to learn something?
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.400]   Or should you simply not be able to sleep
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.680]   for whatever reason on the night following
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.860]   a bout of learning or an attempt to learn?
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.520]   Do not despair, because it turns out
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.480]   that there are what are called
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.560]   second and third night effects also.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.380]   Once you sleep, you will learn those neuroplastic events,
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.300]   the reordering of connections that we call synapses,
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.360]   and the changes that occur in neural circuits
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.520]   that reflects what we call self-directed adaptive plasticity.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.080]   That still will occur, but ideally,
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.100]   you got a great night's sleep on the first night
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.200]   following, trying to learn, and the second night,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.360]   and the third, and so on and so on.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.840]   Now, there are a few other things that are critical
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.380]   to understand about self-directed adaptive plasticity
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.980]   that will become especially important
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.720]   when thinking about protocols
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.280]   for developing the ideal mental training
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.920]   and visualization process for you,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.800]   and that is that there are different forms of plasticity
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.440]   that occur between neurons,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   although the two main forms are what are called
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.640]   long-term potentiation and long-term depression.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.740]   I just want to cue up right now that the word depression
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.720]   is a very loaded word,
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.960]   because the moment people hear the word depression,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.300]   they think, "Oh, no, that's bad."
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.080]   But in the case of neuroplasticity,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.320]   long-term depression is simply a change
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.080]   in the connections between neurons
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.120]   and the excitability between neurons
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.720]   that in many ways can be excellent for learning things,
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.480]   in particular, motor skills.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.720]   And we'll get into this in more detail in a little bit,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.980]   but it turns out that a lot of our ability
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.080]   to get better at some sort of motor skill
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.640]   involves this thing that we call long-term depression.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.280]   And that's because much of what is happening
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.120]   when we learn a new motor skill
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.200]   is that we are depressing or suppressing specific actions
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.480]   in order to generate a very specific coordinated action.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.640]   Some of the best examples of long-term depression
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.840]   can actually be borrowed from developmental plasticity.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.720]   So for instance, if you've ever sat across from an infant
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.800]   who is trying to eat their meal,
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.500]   so imagine a one and a half year old or a two year old
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.520]   trying to eat some noodles or some soup
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.720]   or any kind of baby suitable food with a spoon,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   and they're holding the spoon
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.260]   or they're trying to hold the spoon,
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.820]   what you'll notice is that their motor movements
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.000]   are terribly uncoordinated.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   They often will take that spoon to their cheek
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.680]   or to their eye or to their head.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.800]   We've all seen these very amusing photos of babies
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.520]   with bowls of food on their head
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.300]   or with food all over their face or just everywhere.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.700]   It appears that they're basically getting the food
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.560]   everywhere except where it's supposed to go,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   which is in their mouth.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.240]   And that's because their motor movements
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.280]   are not very well coordinated at that age.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.360]   And they're not very well coordinated,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.760]   not because they lack sufficient numbers
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.260]   of neural connection synapses between neurons,
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.840]   but rather because they have too many connections
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.740]   between too many different neurons.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.080]   The neural circuits that control very dedicated
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.260]   coordinated movement are not there yet.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.960]   Instead, too many neurons are connected
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.300]   to too many other neurons.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.660]   And so they can't generate the precise movements
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.880]   that are required in order to get that spoon to their mouth.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.680]   Now over time, they get better at moving the utensil
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   to their mouth such that hopefully by about age five or six,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.820]   they are eating in a relatively cleaner way.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.960]   And hopefully by the time they're 10 or 11 or 12,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.280]   they're getting the food into their mouth
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.880]   and not all over their face.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.320]   People learn this to varying degrees.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.600]   All you have to do is go to a restaurant
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.600]   and watch how people eat.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.360]   And you will see a vast variation
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.640]   in people's coordinated movements with utensils.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.680]   But in general, there's a theme.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.220]   The younger the person,
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.280]   the more uncoordinated their movement of utensils.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.840]   And as they get older, the more coordinated.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.180]   Now, of course, in people that are very old,
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.600]   they have challenges moving objects
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.900]   and their limbs in very smooth ways.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.080]   And that has to do with a topic that we'll get into
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.240]   when we talk about age-related cognitive decline
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.360]   and motor-related dementias.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.200]   But for sake of today's discussion,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.340]   if you just want to think about what happens
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.720]   with long-term depression and the development
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.660]   of a motor skill, both as a baby, as an adolescent,
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.100]   and as an adult when you're trying to learn a new motor skill
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.080]   is that you are eliminating incorrect movements.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   And when you are eliminating incorrect movements
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.120]   to arrive at only the correct movements
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.860]   in a very reflexive and repeated way.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.920]   So think your golf swing, your tennis serve,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.840]   think serving a volleyball,
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.320]   think a child learning to crawl and then walk,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.240]   think a child learning to eat with utensils,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.520]   an example I gave before.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.400]   What's happening in all of those cases
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.640]   is that yes, certain connections in the brain
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.440]   are being strengthened or what we call potentiated.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.840]   They are undergoing long-term potentiation,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.560]   the so-called quote-unquote fire together,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.820]   wire together mantra that was popularized
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.480]   by the great neurobiologist, Dr. Carla Schatz,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.580]   my colleague at Stanford.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.940]   But in addition to that long-term depression,
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.560]   the quieting or the silencing of specific synapses,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.220]   that is connections between neurons,
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.940]   is absolutely critical for motor skill learning.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.620]   So we have LTP, long-term potentiation,
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.640]   and LTD, long-term depression,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.320]   is every bit as important as LTP, long-term potentiation
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.200]   for getting better at some sort of motor skill
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.900]   and indeed at getting better at some sort
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.360]   of cognitive skill.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.600]   Now, as we hear this, this should be intuitive to all of us.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.520]   If you look at somebody's attempt
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.980]   to learn a particular dance step
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.560]   or at somebody's attempt to do a tennis serve
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.280]   the first time, it's all over the place.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.960]   Now, it's not perhaps all over the place
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.180]   in that they're doing a jumping jack
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.920]   while trying to serve the tennis ball,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.160]   but they're generally arcing the racket too widely
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.420]   on one trial and then they're arcing it too close
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.620]   to their body on the next trial.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.320]   So if we were to draw a line over each one of those trials,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.040]   we would see that there were lines everywhere over time.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.780]   Whereas once they "perfect" the tennis serve,
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.880]   it's going to be line drawn directly over line,
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.720]   drawn directly over line,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.700]   meaning the arc of that tennis serve
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.720]   is going to be very restricted.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.280]   And that without question has reflected the removal
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.860]   or the quieting of particular synapses,
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.280]   connections between neurons in the brain and body,
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.240]   to allow that very narrow coordinated
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.940]   and directed movement.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.680]   The same is true for learning anything
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.640]   in the cognitive domain,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.240]   meaning if you are to learn a language,
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.560]   it is not of course the case
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.080]   that you know every word in that language
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.020]   and then you simply remove certain words
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.720]   and arrive at the correct sentence structure
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.380]   that you're trying to achieve,
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.340]   but rather you have to suppress your native language.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.520]   Or if you're a young child,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.360]   you have to suppress the generation
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.200]   of just kind of random babbling sounds,
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.700]   turns out babbling isn't random at all.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.680]   But the point is that you have to suppress the enunciation
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.280]   of particular sounds and direct the pronunciation
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.320]   of other sounds in order to generate that new language
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.480]   or your ability to speak at all.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.720]   Okay, so we can really think about neuroplasticity
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.040]   as both a building up process
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.320]   in which you increase connection,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.260]   so-called long-term potentiation,
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.680]   and a sculpting down or a removal of connections process
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.260]   that we're going to call long-term depression.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.360]   Now I have to acknowledge that of course
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.920]   there are other forms of neuroplasticity too.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.960]   I know there are probably some aficionados listening to this
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.360]   who will be perhaps shouting back at whatever device
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.260]   my voice is coming out of.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.880]   Wait, what about spike timing dependent plasticity?
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.040]   Or what about paired pulse facilitation?
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.940]   Yes, yes, and yes.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.660]   There are multiple forms of communication between neurons
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.960]   that can strengthen those connections
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.200]   or weaken those connections.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.360]   But for today's discussion,
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.480]   we just broadly want to think about long-term potentiation
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.920]   and long-term depression
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.320]   because it captures the two most important themes
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.980]   related to mental training and visualization,
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.760]   which is that when we perform a given cognitive
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.360]   or physical task in the real world,
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.760]   so we actually try the dance step or the tennis serve,
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.480]   or when we actually try a math problem
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.340]   or we try and learn some specific knowledge
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.040]   and write it down and remember it,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.660]   that is engaging particular neurons, right?
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.200]   They're firing, they're releasing chemicals,
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.680]   but it is also actively suppressing
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.360]   the activity of other neurons.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.320]   And we are always completely unaware
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.400]   of the ways in which our brain
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.800]   is suppressing certain activity, okay?
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.120]   So today we have to keep in mind
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.200]   that where there is strengthening of connections,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.840]   there is also weakening of connections.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.280]   And when it comes to mental training and visualization,
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.160]   and here's the really key point,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.120]   with mental training and visualization,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.440]   you are capturing both processes,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.080]   both the potentiation,
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.400]   that is the building up and strengthening of connections,
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.480]   and the weakening of the connections
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.120]   that are inappropriate for the thing you're trying to learn.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.980]   And there are different aspects
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.360]   of mental training and visualization protocols
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.460]   that really harness the potentiation
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.200]   versus the depression aspect.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.840]   And today we will cover mental training
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.400]   and visualization protocols
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.020]   that capture both the potentiation
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.280]   and the depression aspect of neuroplasticity,
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.960]   and in that way serve as an augment,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.040]   that is a compliment to the actual real world
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.000]   cognitive and physical training that you're doing,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.080]   because I'll just give this away right now,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.600]   turns out that mental training and visualization
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.720]   is not a replacement for real world
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.620]   cognitive or motor behavior.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.760]   Again, mental training and visualization
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   cannot replace real world execution of cognitive tasks
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.740]   or of motor tasks if you want to learn.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.200]   However, mental training and visualization
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.340]   can and has been shown to be effective
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.220]   for greatly enhancing the speed at which you learn
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.880]   and the stability of that learning over time.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.460]   Okay, so let's take a second
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.180]   and really think about what's happening
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.360]   in the brain and body
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.680]   when we do mental training or visualization.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.280]   In fact, we can do a little experiment right now
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.920]   that is not unlike many of the classic experiments
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.160]   looking at what's happening in the brain and body
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.000]   during mental training and visualization,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.280]   in which I just ask you to close your eyes
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.940]   and imagine a yellow cube, okay?
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.760]   And next to that yellow cube is a red rose.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.280]   And perhaps I also ask you to float
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.180]   or fly up above the cube and the rose
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.280]   and look at them from the top, top down.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.300]   And then I tell you to fly back around
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.740]   and land behind those and look at them
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.280]   from the perspective of behind that yellow cube
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.200]   and that red rose, okay?
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.460]   Now, what the data tell us is that most people
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.800]   will be able to do that.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.000]   Most of you will be able to do that
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.240]   to some degree or another,
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.320]   regardless of your attention span,
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.120]   whether or not you have ADHD or not,
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.280]   most of you will be able to do that
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.780]   to some degree or another.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.660]   We also know from neuroimaging studies
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.540]   in which people are placed
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.300]   into a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner,
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.900]   that during the sort of visualization you just did
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.340]   or that I described,
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.380]   that your visual cortex and associated areas
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.380]   quote unquote light up.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.600]   They become very active in similar but not identical ways
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.840]   to how they would light up and be activated
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.180]   were you to actually look at a yellow cube and a red rose
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.380]   on a screen and perhaps fly above them,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.580]   virtually of course, and land behind them,
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.700]   virtually of course,
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.780]   or if you were to actually look at a yellow cube
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.380]   and red rose in the real world,
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.800]   right in front of you on a table,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.500]   then get up on your tippy toes
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.860]   and look down on them from the top
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.740]   and then walk around the table
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.340]   and look at them from the other side.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.620]   So there is some degree of what we call
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.780]   perceptual equivalence between real world experiences,
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.260]   digital experiences and imagined,
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.520]   meaning with our eyes closed,
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.220]   just in our mind's eye experiences.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.460]   This is true not just of vision
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.200]   and what we call the visual domain,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.740]   but also the auditory domain, okay?
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.220]   So for instance, I could play for you
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.940]   a short motif of a song.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.020]   Let's just pick something that I think most people know.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.860]   Goodness, I'm a terrible musician and even worse singer,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.060]   but let's just take the opening to AC/DC's
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.260]   Back in Black, right?
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.080]   I think I can do that one.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.740]   It's like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, okay, got it.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.340]   That's the actual sound,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.560]   although admittedly a dreadful version
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.460]   of the great AC/DC song Back in Black.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.100]   But now I ask you to close your eyes
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.660]   or we could keep them open and just imagine that,
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.820]   dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, okay?
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.940]   Or for instance, I place you in a quiet room,
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.700]   so you close your eyes and ask you to imagine the opening
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.780]   to AC/DC's Black in Black,
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.920]   but ask you to pause it halfway through.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.900]   What you would find again is that most people,
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.660]   somewhere between 90 and 95% of people
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.260]   would be able to do all the sorts of things I described,
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.600]   right, cube and rose, AC/DC Back in Black.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.980]   Even a somatosensory task,
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.140]   imagine what it's like to touch felt
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.140]   or to touch chinchilla hair or something like that,
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.420]   a chinchilla's hair,
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.820]   ideally a live chinchilla sitting still.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.540]   Those little critters move really, really fast,
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.580]   but they have very, very soft hair,
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.980]   high hair density, so soft.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.140]   Okay, most people can do that.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:02.600]   About 5% to 15% of people are less able to do that,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.220]   and there's a small percentage of people
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.200]   in that 5% to 15% that simply cannot do it at all,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.300]   that just cannot visualize well.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.820]   We'll talk later about these people.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.420]   They have what's called aphantasia,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.400]   an inability to mentally visualize,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.420]   but most people are actually pretty good
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.380]   at visualizing things when they are told what to visualize,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.200]   and this is a really key point,
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.620]   and if what they are told to visualize is very simple,
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.520]   and the whole visualization is quite brief,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.580]   lasting on the order of about 15 seconds
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.220]   to generate the visualization in the auditory
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.440]   or in the visual aspect of one's mind's eye or ear,
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.980]   if you will, and if it's repeated over and over.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.500]   What's far harder for everybody to do,
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.780]   and in fact, what most people simply cannot do,
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.180]   is imagine long extended scenes and stories in their mind
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.360]   that go on for minutes and minutes
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.760]   that involve a lot of different sensory stimuli.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.040]   This is a really key point.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.060]   In fact, as we start to home in
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.960]   on ideal mental training and visualization protocols,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.540]   I'd like to establish this as the first principle
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.440]   of mental training and visualization,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.480]   which is that if you are going to use mental training
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.060]   and visualization to its best effect
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.540]   in order to engage in neuroplasticity and learning,
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.440]   you need to keep those visualizations quite brief,
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.960]   really on the order of about 15 to 20 seconds or so,
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.620]   and pretty darn sparse,
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:32.400]   meaning not including a lot of elaborate visualization,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.380]   not including a lot of sequences of motor steps.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.780]   What I mean are motor sequences,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.080]   if you're trying to learn something
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.940]   in terms of physical movement,
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.600]   or visual sequences or auditory sequences,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.800]   if you're trying to learn things
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.100]   in terms of music or dance, et cetera,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   that can be completed and repeated in 15 seconds or less.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.220]   Now, later, I'll give you a couple of specific examples,
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.400]   but if you want to use mental training and visualization,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   understand this is the key first principle.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.360]   They have to be very short visualizations
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.680]   that you can repeat over and over and over again
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.860]   with a high degree of accuracy.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.440]   So you don't want to embark
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.040]   on a mental training and visualization paradigm
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.480]   in which it involves a lot of elaborate stimuli
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.080]   and you have to think really hard and work really hard,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.760]   even if you're in that category
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.200]   of people who can do mental visualization
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.800]   pretty naturally and easily.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.540]   Now, if you're somebody who can't do mental visualization,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.400]   in fact, if you're somebody who has full-blown aphantasia
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.840]   or the inability to mentally visualize,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.120]   well, then it's especially important
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.680]   that you make those mental trainings and visualizations
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.100]   really brief and very, very simple.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.640]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.520]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.000]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.360]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.240]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.940]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.160]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.760]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.840]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.820]   once or usually twice a day
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.420]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.520]   Our gut is very important.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.080]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.840]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.240]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.880]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.720]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.560]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.740]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.040]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.640]   that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.360]   are met and it tastes great.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.820]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.220]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.180]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.500]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.080]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.500]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.180]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.560]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.460]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.480]   Now, in order to develop the best mental training
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.440]   and visualization protocols for you,
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   let's go a little bit deeper into what the research says
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.840]   about mental visualization.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.240]   Now, the classic work on mental visualization
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.200]   really hinges on a number of different researchers
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.720]   and their work, but in particular, Roger Shepard,
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.780]   who did this work at Stanford,
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.400]   and Stephen Kosslyn, who's now at Harvard.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.580]   There are, of course, others in the field,
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.820]   but it's really the work of Shepard and Kosslyn
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.120]   that lay the foundation for our understanding
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.640]   of what happens in the brain
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.620]   when we mentally visualize something.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.700]   Shepard did these incredible experiments
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.500]   in which he had students mentally visualize simple objects,
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.540]   like a square, like a triangle,
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.300]   and he measured how long it took them to do that.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.260]   Now, of course, at the time when he did these experiments,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.260]   there were no sophisticated brain imaging devices
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.960]   and machines like fMRI.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.700]   However, everything I'm about to describe
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.540]   has been later confirmed using things like fMRI.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.980]   What Shepard did and what he found is that
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.000]   if people were told to visualize very simple objects,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.720]   they did it pretty quickly.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.040]   However, if they were told to visualize more complex objects
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.480]   or, importantly, to rotate those objects in their mind's eye,
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.900]   well, then it took longer for them to perform
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.480]   those mental visualizations.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.280]   Now, many of you might think, duh,
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.420]   if I have to just imagine a triangle or a cube,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.040]   that's going to be very easy and very fast,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.420]   whereas if I have to rotate that triangle or a cube
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.000]   in my mind's eye, that's going to take more time.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.620]   And indeed, that is somewhat of a duh,
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.300]   except, and this is so very important,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.380]   except that what Shepard and his colleagues found
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.760]   is that how long it takes somebody to generate
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.240]   and rotate a given visual image scales directly
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.520]   with the complexity of that image.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.780]   In fact, Koslin did some experiments,
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.500]   I think illustrate this even better.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.340]   And here's the experiment.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.360]   I love this experiment.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.260]   I think you'll love it too,
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.780]   because it illustrates something so fundamentally important
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.120]   about how our brains work,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.540]   not just for sake of mental training and visualization,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.500]   but just how our brains work at all.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.860]   He showed people a picture of a map,
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.540]   so a map drawn on a piece of paper.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.340]   This was a map of an island.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.080]   It included things like a loading dock for some boats.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.620]   It had a location for getting food on the island.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.740]   It had some trees.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.580]   It had some other small landmarks drawn out,
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.380]   and people looked at this and memorized it.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.520]   Or in other experiments,
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.900]   they just had people imagine this island
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.480]   and the location of these different landmarks on the island.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.460]   So it didn't really matter which.
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.280]   But then he had people imagine moving or walking
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.380]   from one location on the island to another.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.120]   So they'd say, okay, you're at the loading dock.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.140]   Now move to the restaurant.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.080]   Okay, you're at the restaurant.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.620]   Now move to the palm tree.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.100]   You're on the North shore of the island.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.480]   Now go around the side of the island clockwise
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.940]   to arrive at the bay on the Southwest corner,
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.300]   this sort of thing.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.100]   What Coslin found was absolutely incredible.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.660]   What he found was that the amount of time
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.700]   that it takes people to move from one location on the map
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.900]   to another scaled linearly, directly,
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.380]   with the actual physical location
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.700]   between those objects on the map.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.020]   So for those of you that can understand
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.820]   or into the importance of what Shepard and Coslin showed,
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.960]   great.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.320]   I'm guessing, however, that for most people out there,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.840]   you're still grasping it like, okay, interesting.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.760]   How things happen in the real world
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.980]   dictates how they happen in our mind's eye.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.000]   But I want to make sure that I really nail home
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.120]   the importance of this for everybody.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.860]   The importance of this is that
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.880]   when we look at something in the real world,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.740]   so if I look at the pen in front of me,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.580]   I'm holding up my pen.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.420]   For those of you that are listening,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.320]   just holding up my pen in front of me.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.600]   I move it to the right and back and forth.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   What's happening is I'm activating
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.820]   or I'm triggering the electrical activity of neurons,
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.780]   which we can think of kind of as pixels in my eye, okay?
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.700]   So it's leftward to rightward motion for me
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.780]   and back and forth.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.940]   And those are getting activated
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.700]   and they're sending signals up to my visual cortex.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.040]   And that information is processed at a given speed.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.000]   What the visualization experiments
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.520]   that Shepard and Coslin and others did show
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.420]   is that the processing speed of imagined experiences
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.260]   is exactly the same as the processing speed
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.780]   of real experiences.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.040]   And the spatial relationship between imagined
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:22.160]   and real experiences is exactly the same as well.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.580]   Put simply, when we imagine something in our mind's eye
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.980]   or mind's ear, we are imagining the real thing happening.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.900]   And when I say the real thing,
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.440]   it's not the obvious real thing.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.580]   Of course, if you're imagining something,
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.900]   that's the thing you're imagining.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.940]   What I mean is that your brain at the level of neurons
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.780]   is behaving exactly the same way.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.500]   And this needn't have been the case, okay?
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.580]   There could have been a result, for instance,
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.780]   that if people were asked to visualize a cube
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.940]   and rotate it from, you know, flip it from top to bottom,
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.300]   okay, so put the top that's upward on a table,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.380]   now down on the table and so forth,
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.020]   or to migrate around the island, you know,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.780]   counterclockwise going from, you know,
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.860]   the Northern coast all the way down to the Southern coast,
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.500]   clockwise, and then back up to the Northern coast,
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.980]   that they could have just done it really quickly,
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.620]   like all in one second, but that's not what happens.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.040]   They always match the speed at which they do things
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.500]   in their mind's eye to the same speed
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.580]   that they do them in the real world.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.460]   So in telling you this,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.780]   what I'm saying is that mental visualization
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   at the neural level is identical to real world events.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.660]   So when you've heard that when we imagine something,
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.220]   it's identical in terms of our brain's experience of it
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.260]   and our body's experience of it,
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.500]   as when we actually experience something,
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.840]   that is true at the neural level.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.140]   However, when it comes to learning and improving performance
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.940]   in the cognitive or physical domain,
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.460]   they are not equivalent.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.340]   So this is the second principle
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.120]   of mental training and visualization.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.500]   As you recall, the first principle
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.060]   of mental training and visualization
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.560]   was that in order to make it effective,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.060]   it needs to be very brief and very simple
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.340]   and repeated over and over again.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   The second principle of mental training and visualization
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.440]   is that while yes, mental training and visualization
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.280]   recaptures the same patterns of neural firing
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.860]   in the exact same ways as real world behavior and thinking,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:22.300]   it is not as effective as real world behavior and thinking.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.480]   In other words, if you want to learn something,
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.580]   the ideal situation is to combine real training
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.620]   in the physical world with mental training.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.500]   And I'll talk about exactly how to do that
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.680]   and in what ratios a little bit later.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.080]   Now there's a really incredible set of experiments
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.700]   that illustrate why it is that mental training
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.660]   and visualization can be extremely effective,
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.660]   but that it's always going to be most effective
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.660]   when combined with real world training and experiences.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.500]   The experiments that I'm talking about involve the use
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.900]   of what are called bistable images or impossible figures.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.260]   Some of you are probably familiar with impossible figures.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.820]   These are figures or objects that when you look at them,
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.940]   they have these odd features.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.500]   Like you're not sure where they stop and where they start,
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.600]   where they end.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.040]   One good example would be the so-called Möbius strip.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.700]   The Möbius strip is literally a strip
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.140]   or a line that is contiguous.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.700]   It goes up and it loops around and then it curves around
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.620]   and then it goes back and it just continues and continues.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.620]   And when you look at it, you can never really tell
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.540]   where it starts and where it stops
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.940]   because it doesn't have any of the features
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.900]   that allow you to see what's the front and what's the back
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.400]   in any kind of stable way.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.000]   Another example of an impossible figure
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.340]   would be a little set of cubes
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.480]   that look like they're coming out toward you,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.200]   maybe with a little bend in them,
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.120]   going up at a right angle perhaps.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.900]   But then if you look at it a little bit longer,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.800]   that little piece that's facing up looks like it's in front
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.160]   and you can't really tell what's in front
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.120]   and what's in back.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.480]   And so it's called an impossible figure
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.720]   because you don't really know how to frame it in your mind
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.740]   to tell what's closer to you and what's further apart.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.240]   Bistable images are somewhat similar,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.440]   although different in the sense that they typically
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.960]   are simple silhouettes.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.640]   So for instance, the faces vases bistable image
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.200]   is perhaps the most famous of these,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.240]   where you look at this image, it's very simple
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.080]   and it looks like two vases.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.520]   But then you look at it a little bit longer
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.160]   and you realize that you're looking at the side angle
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.520]   or the profile of two faces looking at one another.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.680]   And when you see those two faces looking at one another,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.440]   you can't see the vases at the same time,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.800]   but then if you decide to see the vases again,
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.320]   you can see the vases again, but the faces disappear.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.560]   So it's bistable, meaning that you can't see the faces
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.280]   and vases at the same time.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.040]   And impossible figures and bistable images
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.100]   are capturing the fact that your visual cortex
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.480]   and some of the associated areas
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.240]   that compute visual scenes in your world
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.880]   are essentially trying to recreate whatever it is
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.240]   that's out in front of them.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.600]   And that's effectively what your visual system does.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.460]   It's very good at recreating visual images in your brain,
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.560]   in your mind's eye.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.480]   'Cause if you think about it, even with your eyes open,
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.360]   your brain is just creating an abstract representation
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.540]   of what it thinks is out there.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.140]   But that when it comes to assigning an identity
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.460]   to something like, oh, that's a face or, oh, that's a vase,
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.800]   that is constrained by different neural circuits,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.240]   by different areas of the brain.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:18.000]   And somehow those circuits can't be co-active.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.600]   We cannot see the faces and the vases
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.880]   at exactly the same time.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.920]   We can switch back and forth really quickly
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.160]   just as we can switch back and forth really quickly
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.820]   when we're looking at the impossible figure and think,
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.840]   okay, that's the front of it, that's the back.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.440]   No, wait, that's the back, that's the front.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.360]   And it's going back and forth,
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.420]   but we can't see them both at the same time.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.480]   No one can see them both at the same time, okay?
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   We know this from brain imaging studies.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.720]   Now, impossible figures in bistable images can be seen,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.800]   right, you could look them up right now
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.420]   on your phone or computer,
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.280]   or I could show you pictures of them on paper
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.400]   right in front of you.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.020]   And you can do these sorts of perceptual experiments
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.120]   of telling people, look at the face, look at the vase,
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.400]   look at the front of the cube, now make it at the back
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.080]   of the cube, and they can do this somewhat deliberately.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.900]   However, and this is, I think, so very interesting
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.960]   to understanding how mental training and visualization
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.740]   does and does not support real-world learning.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:14.180]   If you try to imagine a bistable image, you can't do it.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.900]   In fact, no one can do it until they do something else, okay?
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.520]   So for those of you that are saying, wait, I can do it,
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.720]   I can do faces, vases in my mind's eye.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.160]   I promise you that the neuroimaging disputes your belief,
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.320]   okay, and supports the idea that we can see real-world
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.720]   bistable images, we can see real-world impossible figures,
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.200]   but when we try and imagine those in our mind's eye,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.520]   we simply can't do it.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.080]   We can't do the perceptual shift in our mind's eye.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.400]   We can't switch back and forth between faces and vases.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.000]   However, and I just have to chuckle
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.120]   'cause I think these experiments are so clever,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   if I have you trace or draw with a pen on a piece of paper,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:42:01.400]   an impossible figure or the faces, vases, bistable image,
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.640]   and then I ask you to imagine that bistable image
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.600]   or impossible figure and to switch back and forth,
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.220]   you are able to do it.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.180]   So what that illustrates is that it's the combination
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.760]   of imagined and real-world experiences,
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.640]   real motor movements, real perceptual experiences
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.060]   combined with motor movements,
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.120]   combined with what you imagine in your mind's eye
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.620]   that really gives you the most depth and flexibility
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.360]   over your mental visualization.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.000]   And in doing so, we can really stamp down a third principle
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.560]   of mental training and visualization,
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.360]   which is that your mental training and visualization
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.280]   will be far more effective
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.680]   and physical tasks in the real world, okay?
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.340]   So first principle is mental training and visualization
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.800]   needs to be simple and brief and repeated.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.960]   Second is that mental training and visualization
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.300]   is not a replacement for real-world motor training
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.320]   or cognitive training.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.600]   It's an augment.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.000]   It's an addition that can really help.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.420]   And the third principle of mental training and visualization
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.100]   is that you need to combine mental training and visualization
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.060]   with real-world behaviors and experiences
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.720]   that are very, very similar.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.020]   Now as a brief, but I think really relevant aside,
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.980]   one of the things that also makes mental training
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.560]   and visualization more effective
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.400]   is when we assign cognitive labels
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.700]   to what's going on when we visualize.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.340]   So what I mean is that people are much better
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.500]   at manipulating faces and vases in their mind's eye,
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.240]   of course, only once they've drawn them out physically
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.460]   with their hand, as I mentioned before,
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.020]   then they are manipulating abstract objects
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.680]   like impossible figures, in part,
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.240]   because by labeling them faces and vases,
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.180]   people are able to capture a lot of other neural machinery
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.860]   that's related to faces and vases.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.360]   In fact, we have entire brain areas
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.220]   on both sides of the brain
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.780]   devoted to the processing of faces.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.760]   They're called fusiform face area.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.180]   We have other areas in our brain
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.000]   that are involved in processing of 3D objects,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.380]   but faces are of particular value.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.220]   There's a value to understanding what a face is
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.540]   as opposed to a non-face,
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.780]   and there's a value to understanding
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.860]   what a particular face is.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.640]   In fact, the simplest way to put this
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.820]   is that the human brain is, in many ways,
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.660]   a face recognition and expression
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.760]   of faces recognition machine.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.700]   It, of course, does other things,
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.580]   but it is exceptionally good at that.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.380]   Unless you're in a profession
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.600]   in which the relationships between 3D objects
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.880]   and your ability to manipulate them is exceedingly important,
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.140]   you're not going to have a lot of neural real estate
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.180]   specifically devoted to that.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.520]   Some people will be better at it, some people will be worse,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.120]   but when it comes to faces,
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.460]   unless you have a condition like proprasagnosia,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.100]   which is an inability to recognize, say, famous faces
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.060]   and distinguish them from non-famous faces,
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.740]   or if you have some sort of face recognition deficit,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.520]   which about anywhere from one, perhaps,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.960]   to 3% of people out there have,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.740]   they're just terrible at recognizing faces.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.240]   And by the way, there's about half a percent of people
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.600]   out there that are what are called super recognizers
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.780]   that can recognize faces in a large crowd,
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.380]   they can recognize specific faces
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.160]   even from just partial profiles.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.680]   By the way, these people are extremely valuable
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.300]   to securities agencies and security agencies
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.140]   are very good at finding these people.
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:22.200]   Machines are quickly getting better,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.340]   or at least as good as super recognizers,
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.220]   but the best super recognizers are still better
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.700]   than the best AI and machine algorithms out there.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.320]   But the point is that in your mind's eye,
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.660]   you are better able to manipulate specific objects
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.920]   or to see things more clearly and with more specificity
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.360]   when it has a label that you recognize
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.920]   from your real world experience,
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.960]   as opposed to abstract or fictional labels, okay?
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.980]   Again, stamping home the idea
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.540]   that what you experience in the real world
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.320]   really serves to support your mental imagery,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.000]   and therefore the key importance of experiencing
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.960]   and doing things in the real world
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.860]   and supporting that with mental training and visualization
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.240]   and not just relying on mental training and visualization.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.920]   And the tangent here that's a little bit of fun,
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.420]   and I don't think we've ever talked about before
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.520]   on this podcast, is that of UFOs,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.240]   unidentified flying objects.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.260]   You know, there's a lot of people out there
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.940]   who think that they've seen UFOs.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.140]   I guess technically they have
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.260]   because a UFO is an identified flying object,
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.440]   and if it's unidentified, at least to them,
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.700]   then it is indeed a UFO.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.440]   I guess the question is whether or not,
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.860]   or the dispute rather, is whether or not those UFOs
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.320]   are actually flown by aliens or controlled by aliens.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.200]   I think that's where the dispute lies.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.400]   But you can imagine how if somebody sees an object
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.320]   in their environment and decides, ah, that's a UFO, okay?
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.200]   Remember these faces, vases, or these impossible figures?
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.020]   If they say, oh, that thing is a UFO
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.080]   as opposed to something else,
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.100]   they see, in other words, the face, not the vase.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.000]   Well, that stamps it down as a memory
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.040]   in their visual system and related systems.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.840]   And then in their mind's eye, they are seeing the UFO.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.740]   They're not seeing the other thing
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.360]   that it could possibly be, okay?
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.460]   So it stamped down a very specific memory.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.720]   So the point here is that mental training and visualization
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.120]   relies on not just the physical contours
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.080]   and the exact spatial profiles and the speed of movement
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.380]   of particular things that we experience in the real world.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.540]   It also heavily depends on the cognitive labels
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.240]   and the decisions we make about the things that we see.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.040]   And this will become very important
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.640]   as we build up toward our fourth principle
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.140]   of mental training and visualization,
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.640]   which is that our cognitive labels,
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.680]   that is, what we decide is happening
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.240]   when we do mental training and visualization
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.960]   turns out to be very important.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.500]   Now, this is not simply to say that you can decide,
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.500]   okay, I want to learn how to play piano.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.560]   And so I'm going to tell myself
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.640]   that a particular chord I imagine in my mind's eye
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.320]   is identical to the real world chord
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.740]   just because I decide it is.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.800]   The brain doesn't work that way.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.640]   It's not possible to just lie to yourself
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.140]   and learn better as a consequence of the lies
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.120]   you tell yourself.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.520]   However, what this tells us is that
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.400]   it is very, very important
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.600]   that your mental training and visualization
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.760]   accurately recapitulate the real world training
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   that you're doing.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.600]   So we are going to stamp down a fourth principle
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.060]   of effective mental training and visualization
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.040]   based on what we know from the scientific literature
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.120]   is that your mental training and visualization
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.320]   should assign labels to what you're doing
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.160]   that can be matched to real world training and experiences.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.860]   Now, these can be somewhat abstract.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.540]   So for instance, if you're trying to learn
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.860]   a particular aspect of the golf swing, okay?
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.260]   So let's say that you're working on your golf swing,
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.560]   seems to be there are a lot of people out there
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.880]   working on their golf swing,
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.180]   and you're going to do some mental training and visualization
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.960]   in order to improve your golf swing.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.120]   We already know, again, let's just march through them,
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.800]   that your mental training and visualization
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.280]   needs to be brief and simple.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.640]   It needs to be the same, or in fact, it will be,
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.040]   we can say the same as your real world golf swing.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.880]   In other words, it will take you
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.700]   exactly the same amount of time to perform that golf swing
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.020]   in your mind's eye as it would in the real world.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.920]   Incredible, right?
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.420]   Again, something that maybe is taking
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.120]   a little bit of time to sink in, but once it does,
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.020]   you're going to be like, wow,
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.380]   the brain is really an incredible machine.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.080]   And that third principle that you still have to do
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.700]   golf swings in the real world
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.580]   in addition to the mental training of golf swings.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.920]   And fourth, that if you want that mental training
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.880]   and visualization to really improve your golf swing,
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.560]   you're going to have to name or apply an identity
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.200]   to the specific golf swing or aspect of the golf swing
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.040]   that you're practicing.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.360]   So this could be abstract.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.560]   You could call it mental training and visualization
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.100]   of golf swing 1A, and you could imagine in your mind's eye
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.360]   the perfect golf swing over and over and over and over.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.760]   But then when you're in the real world,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.360]   you're also going to have to call that,
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.520]   either out loud or just to yourself, golf swing 1A, okay?
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.800]   As opposed to a putt, which might be 1B.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   So naming and giving an identity to a real world skill
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.400]   and applying the same name or identity
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.000]   to the mental version of that, the visualization of that,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.440]   can enhance the mental training and visualization
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.680]   in significant ways.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.980]   So when we apply identities or names
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.040]   to these mental trainings and visualizations,
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.000]   and again, provided that they are brief and repeated
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.900]   and so on, we greatly enhance the amount of neural machinery
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.520]   in the brain and body that we are able to recruit
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.060]   when we go to perform those real world golf swings
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.980]   and golf putts, and here just replace golf swing
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.360]   and golf putt with anything that you're trying to learn,
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.000]   you're able to recruit a lot more neural machinery
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.280]   and greatly increase the probability of proper execution.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.240]   So before we go any further, I want to share with you
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.800]   a couple of incredible aspects of mental visualization
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.320]   that really can be harnessed and applied
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.040]   toward mental training and visualization.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.140]   Some of these were done by Roger Shepherd
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.940]   and his graduate students and postdocs,
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.880]   some were done by Steve Costlin and by others.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.680]   What these experiments really show
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.020]   is that mental training and visualization
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.440]   is capturing many, many of the exact same features
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.800]   of real world behavior and perceptions,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.640]   not all of them, but many of them.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.880]   So for instance, if I tell you to close your eyes
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   and imagine a ceiling that has tiles
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.580]   that are black and white checkered tiles,
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.880]   you know, one black tile, one white tile, for instance,
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.560]   we know based on experiments where we measure eye movements
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.200]   behind closed eyelids, that people tend to move their eyes up
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.220]   when they are imagining things above them,
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.400]   such as the ceiling.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.540]   Whereas if I tell you to imagine things down on the floor,
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.440]   like you're taking a hike and you're looking
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.520]   for rattlesnakes, actually just recently I experienced
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.200]   because it's spring here in California,
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.840]   rattlesnake along a hiking trail,
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.740]   it's really quite beautiful, although I have to confess,
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.440]   I enjoyed keeping my distance, I don't like snakes,
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.160]   very much, I don't dislike snakes,
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.000]   but I prefer not to interact with them unless I have to.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.900]   If I have you imagine that rattlesnake,
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.400]   depending on your relationship or thoughts
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.140]   about rattlesnakes, number of things will happen
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.540]   in your brain, of course, activation of the limbic system
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:02.180]   or not, for instance.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.840]   But what I know is that regardless of how you feel
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:09.840]   about snakes, most of you will move your eyes down
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.280]   when imagining a snake, okay?
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.980]   It might be subtle, it might be fast,
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.820]   but statistically, that result shows up as opposed
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.460]   to when I imagine or I ask you to imagine something
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.680]   above you, you tend to move your eyes up.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.080]   In addition to that, if I tell you, for instance,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.500]   to imagine an elephant and a mouse next to one another,
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.460]   you presumably have some real world understanding
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.100]   about the relative sizes of elephants versus mice.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.320]   Elephants generally are bigger than mice, thank goodness.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.900]   Mice are smaller than elephants.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.460]   If I ask you to tell me about the details
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.820]   of that mouse's face, so for instance,
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.940]   can you see its whiskers?
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.420]   The processing time required for you to do that
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.260]   is much longer than the processing time required
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.220]   if I say, tell me what the position
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.940]   of that elephant's trunk is.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.020]   Now, why would that be so, okay?
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.380]   The position of the elephant's trunk wasn't something
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.960]   that I told you, it wasn't dictated by me,
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.140]   it's in your mind's eye.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.100]   Maybe you don't even know
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.180]   and you have to go searching for it.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.680]   But what we do know is that if I tell you
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.840]   to look at a small object in your mind's eye
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.860]   versus a larger object, so for instance,
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.400]   the mouse versus the elephant,
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.520]   it takes longer for you to do that.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.220]   In other words, just as with the map experiment,
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.140]   the distance between things on a map is conserved
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.120]   in your mind's eye as a linear relationship,
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.580]   takes longer to go far distances between things on a map
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:35.400]   in your mind than it does to go shorter distances.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.160]   It's also the case that it takes you longer
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.620]   to look at the details of a small object
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.700]   versus a large object because why?
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.140]   Because you are zooming in in your mind's eye.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:50.100]   Again, all of which speaks to the equivalence
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.660]   of mental imagery with real world imagery and perception.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.360]   And as I mentioned earlier, and as we'll see in a moment,
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.620]   this also extends into the motor domain.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.220]   It takes you longer to perform complex motor sequences
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.200]   in your mind's eye than it does simple motor sequences,
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.980]   just as it would in the real world.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.740]   And if you're saying, of course, of course, of course,
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.820]   well then great, then we've really underscored the point,
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.060]   which is that when you imagine things,
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.020]   it is not exactly the same, but it is very,
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.940]   very much the same as actually doing
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.040]   or perceiving those things in the real world.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.820]   And the fifth principle of effective mental training
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.220]   and visualization is this notion of equivalence
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:34.020]   of mental imagery versus real world perception and behavior.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.100]   These are the experiments, as you recall,
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.540]   where if people are told to look for clouds
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.500]   in their mental visualization, they tend to look up,
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.660]   or if they're looking for something on the floor,
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.400]   they tend to look down even behind closed eyelids.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Now, this can be applied toward building
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.900]   an especially effective mental training
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.220]   and visualization protocol if you deliberately move
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.420]   your eyes in the direction of the thing or things
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.220]   that you are trying to recapitulate in your mind,
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:02.120]   in your visualization, that is.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.180]   You don't necessarily have to include this step,
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.140]   but mental training and visualization is going to be
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:10.620]   more effective if you do, because with consciously generated
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.760]   eye movements, again, even behind closed eyelids,
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.380]   you are bringing about more of the neural circuitry
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.780]   that one would experience if you were to perform
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.700]   that particular cognitive task or motor task
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:24.120]   in the real world, which as I mentioned before
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.140]   in principle number three, you need to be doing anyway,
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.820]   separately from your mental training and visualization.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.360]   So what we're talking about here is thus far five principles
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.080]   of mental training and visualization that are well-established
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.440]   from the scientific research literature.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.420]   In fact, I haven't mentioned this quite yet,
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.900]   and I'll refer to some other references,
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.640]   but there's a wonderful systematic review
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.020]   of a large number of studies that have looked
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.640]   at mental training and visualization, what's effective,
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.340]   what's less effective across a bunch of different disciplines
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.200]   that include education, medicine, music,
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.700]   psychology, and sports.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.000]   We will provide a link to this paper
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.740]   in the show note captions, but the title of the paper
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.560]   is "Best Practice for Motor Imagery,"
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.500]   a systematic literature review on motor imagery training
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.420]   elements in five different disciplines.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.060]   As the title suggests, it's mainly
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.940]   for motor imagery training, but it extends into music,
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.140]   which of course involves motor training and execution,
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.200]   but as well as education.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.540]   This review establishes a number
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.420]   of different important things.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.940]   I'm going to read off some of the key
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.820]   or highlight takeaways.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:25.220]   For instance, I described principle one
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.580]   of effective mental training and visualization,
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.060]   which is that the visualization be brief
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.900]   and it be simple and it be repeated.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.900]   May ask how many times that very brief five
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.140]   to 15 second exercise of going through some routine
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.640]   should be repeated.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.100]   Well, different studies have used different ranges
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.580]   of let's call them repetitions in a given training session,
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.440]   but the number that seems to be most effective
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   is somewhere between 50 and 75 repeats per session.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.480]   That brings about the question of how long one should rest
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.460]   between each repeat.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.760]   This gets a little tricky depending
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.640]   on what you're trying to do.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.060]   Remember that we have this threshold of about 15 seconds
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.120]   for completion of the entire motor sequence.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.360]   Let's say what you're trying to do,
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.320]   like a golf swing takes you five seconds to imagine
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.400]   in your mind's eye from the point where you,
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.960]   let's just say, have the ball on the tee,
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.920]   you bring the golf club up,
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.960]   you might reposition your feet just a little bit,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.920]   kind of a little wiggle that golfers do, and then the swing.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.960]   If that whole thing takes five seconds in your mind's eye
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.260]   and roughly five seconds in the real world,
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.920]   well, then you'd be able to repeat it, of course,
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.680]   three times in 15 seconds.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.660]   That would be one repetition,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.120]   even though you're doing it three times.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.240]   So there's one 15 second epoch,
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.080]   as it's sometimes called, E-P-O-C-H, epoch.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.520]   And then you would rest
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.840]   for an approximately equivalent amount of time,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.880]   15 seconds or so, and then repeat.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:54.520]   And rest 15 seconds or so, and then repeat.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.500]   Rest 15 seconds, and then repeat.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.080]   Again, three golf swings within that 15 seconds,
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:57:59.960]   rest 15 seconds.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.200]   Three golf swings within that 15 seconds, rest 15 seconds.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.300]   Truth told, these epochs and these rest periods
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.800]   do not need to be exact.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.440]   You could imagine, for instance,
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.600]   that you get three repetitions of the swing
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.160]   within 14 seconds.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.320]   Well, then do you do another one,
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.140]   or do you wait until the end of that 15 seconds?
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.520]   I encourage you not to obsess too much
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.980]   about those sorts of points.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.900]   Rather, you want to do as many repeats as you can
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.480]   in about a 15 second epoch,
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.700]   and then rest for about 15 seconds,
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:34.660]   and then repeat for a total of 50 to 75 repetitions.
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.420]   Which might not sound like a lot to some of you,
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.580]   might sound like an awful lot to others of you.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.060]   To me, it sounds like a lot.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.420]   50 repetitions of something
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.440]   and where you're trying to concentrate in your mind's eye
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.180]   on getting something accomplished over and over,
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:51.060]   over again in exactly the same way, might seem like a lot.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.400]   We know, based on the learning literature,
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.040]   that your ability to successfully perform something
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.740]   in the real world will lend itself to better performance
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.580]   of that thing in the imagined world within your mind's eye.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.540]   That's also one of these sort of does.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.300]   But if you're trying to get better at something
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.900]   that you've never performed before,
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.100]   you really should know that.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.740]   The mental training visualization
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.300]   is probably not the best augment
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.660]   to that real world training
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.420]   until you're able to perform it successfully
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.520]   in the real world, at least some of the time.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.100]   Mental training and visualization can be effective, however,
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.580]   at increasing the accuracy or the frequency
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.880]   at which you can do that real world behavior.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.100]   So if normally you're only getting the correct swing
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:38.220]   or you're only hitting the golf ball correctly,
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.380]   say 10% of the time, mental training and visualization
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.500]   can really help bring that number up.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.980]   But it is important that you are able
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.780]   to successfully complete that motor task in the real world.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.340]   Similarly, for performance of cognitive tasks,
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:53.540]   so say, for instance, speaking a new language,
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.220]   you might ask, well, gosh, what in the landscape
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.440]   of speaking a new language can be restricted
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.540]   to five to 15 seconds where I could repeat it
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.980]   anywhere from one to three times in a given epoch
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.340]   and then rest and then keep repeating 50 to 75 times?
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.580]   Well, there, I would encourage you to pick something
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.220]   that you are able to do perhaps very slowly,
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:16.500]   so to speak a particular sentence but with some challenge
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.900]   in getting the accent and the annunciation right,
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.500]   but you've completed it successfully before
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.100]   and you want to get more smooth or more fluid with it.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.060]   Likewise for playing piano or guitar,
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.380]   again, you have to translate to the specific cognitive
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:33.900]   and or motor activity that you are seeking to improve at.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.740]   But those epochs lasting five to 15 seconds
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.300]   are really the cornerstone of an effective mental training
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.340]   and visualization practice and the repeated nature of it,
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.220]   50 to 75 repetitions in a given session
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.080]   is also another cornerstone
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.980]   of an effective mental training and visualization practice.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.540]   So says this review and some of the other papers
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.860]   that I'm going to get to in a few moments.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.720]   Now, one of the other key components
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.540]   of a successful mental training and visualization practice
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.260]   is how often you perform that mental training
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.700]   and visualization practice.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.780]   And again, a number of different studies have looked at this
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.980]   through a number of different lenses,
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.600]   meaning anywhere from two to eight times per week.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.700]   It does appear that performing these sessions
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.060]   anywhere from three to five times per week
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.720]   is going to be effective.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.440]   We could perhaps even say most effective
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.420]   because most of the, let's just call it the strongest data
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.860]   really point to repeating these 50 to 75 trials
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.420]   of the same thing, three to five times per week.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.300]   So you can come up with a number
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.700]   that's reasonable for you to do consistently.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.140]   And you might ask, do you have to continue
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.260]   to perform the mental training and visualization forever?
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.360]   And the good news is the answer to that question is no.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.880]   It does seem that once you have
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.120]   what's called consolidated the motor performance
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.700]   or the cognitive performance of something,
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.060]   it can be further supported or reinforced,
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.580]   that is consolidated in the neural circuits
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.140]   that are responsible for performing
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.380]   that mental or physical task.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.360]   So in other words, once you are performing
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.340]   that cognitive or motor task in a way that's satisfactory
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.380]   or perhaps just improved, perhaps you're not 100%,
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.200]   but it's improved in the real world,
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.380]   you don't need to continue to do mental training
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.400]   and visualization to maintain that real world performance.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.240]   So that's a good thing.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.300]   In fact, the ideal situation would be then
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.660]   to pick a different sequence
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.780]   or thing that you're trying to learn
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.440]   and do mental training and visualization for that.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.580]   I perhaps might've misspoke there,
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.500]   although I don't want to edit this out.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.740]   I misspoke in the sense that, again,
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.460]   I said for the thing that you're trying to learn,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.500]   remember mental training and visualization
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.940]   is going to be most effective for building up
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:49.220]   the number of accurate trials
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.660]   or your ability to do something with a greater frequency
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.740]   of something that you're already capable of doing
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.240]   or have done at least once in the real world, okay?
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.380]   This is not to say that mental training and visualization
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.540]   can't be used to acquire new skills.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.100]   It can in principle,
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.300]   but it has been shown to be most effective
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.200]   for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.800]   that one has already demonstrated some degree
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.180]   of proficiency at in the real world.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.020]   I think that's important to point out
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.700]   because we often hear mental training and visualization
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.100]   and this equivalence of perceptual and motor experiences
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.940]   in our mind's eye to the real world and we think,
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.120]   oh, all we have to do is imagine doing something
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.980]   and we will get better at it.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.700]   And unfortunately, that's not the case.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.280]   The good news is, however, if you can do something once,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.300]   even very slowly in the real world,
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.480]   and then you bring it to the mental imagery
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.660]   and visualization domain,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.060]   you can get much faster at it in a way
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.380]   that really does translate back to the real world.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.960]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.800]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.080]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.760]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.320]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.900]   to help you better understand your body
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.760]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.060]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.020]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.380]   that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers,
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.500]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.220]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.340]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.860]   is that most of the time,
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:15.580]   it does not come back with any information about what to do
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.820]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.680]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.120]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.580]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.740]   becomes very straightforward
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.660]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.700]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.440]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.580]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.620]   that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.340]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.000]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB in their ultimate plan.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.660]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.420]   and therefore, there's extreme value
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.420]   to knowing your ApoB levels.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.820]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.540]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.880]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.220]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.420]   Now, if you recall principle number three,
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.300]   or what I'm calling principle number three
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.540]   of effective mental training and visualization,
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.240]   which was that you have to be able to perform
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.600]   the thing that you're trying to get better at
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.900]   through visualization and imagery in the real world.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:20.260]   That should raise the question of what is the ratio
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.500]   of real-world training versus mental training
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.980]   that's going to be most effective?
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.860]   Ah, well, here, there's some really interesting data,
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.220]   not just in the review that I mentioned,
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.680]   but in a couple of the other papers
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.760]   that we're going to talk about in a few minutes.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.820]   But what I've done is I've synthesized the information
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.920]   across those papers, and they really all point to the fact
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.840]   that real-world training is more effective
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.040]   than mental training, and mental training
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.120]   is more effective than no training.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   Now, the mental training more effective than no training
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.840]   is kind of a duh, except that there are people,
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.280]   for instance, people who are injured,
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.760]   who are trying to maintain or replenish some motor skill
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.100]   or ability to move in a particular way,
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.540]   or who have had a traumatic brain injury
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.720]   and are trying to recreate experiences
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.900]   in a way that's safe for them while
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.480]   in a somewhat restricted format.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.320]   So for instance, if you've damaged a limb
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.480]   or you're experiencing chronic pain
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.480]   and you need to take a layoff from some physical activity,
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.880]   there are now many studies looking at stroke patients,
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.920]   at patients that have been in accidents, TBI,
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.080]   also people who are suffering from more conventional limb
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.960]   and connective tissue injuries,
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.480]   that if they do mental training,
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.800]   it obviously is not going to put them at risk
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.420]   of doing those same movements
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.860]   as it would in the real world, right?
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.560]   But that it can actually accelerate
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.440]   or at least maintain skill performance.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.500]   So this is pretty exciting if you think about it,
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.940]   what this means and the reason it underscores
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:50.520]   this mental training is better than no training is that
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.160]   should you find yourself in the unfortunate circumstance
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.080]   of being injured or unable to perform a given behavior,
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.080]   imagining the sequence of behavior
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.260]   that you'd like to maintain or even build up over time,
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.480]   provided you've done that motor sequence before
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.560]   in the real world.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.180]   Well, the mental training and visualization
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.560]   can really help keep that online
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.200]   or even help you improve over time.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.320]   In fact, I have a colleague in the psychology department
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.520]   at Stanford who told me an anecdote
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.560]   and admittedly it's just an anecdote
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.880]   of a student who was recruited to Stanford,
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.160]   both for their academic prowess,
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.700]   but also for their abilities in tennis
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.260]   and was injured in their first year
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.400]   and at first thought this was devastating,
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.000]   but did a cognitive reframe around the idea
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.680]   that that let's call it extended layoff from actual tennis
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.840]   was going to afford them the ability to do
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.800]   more mental training than they would otherwise,
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.900]   even though they were quite sad to not be able to do
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.760]   actual physical training for tennis.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.900]   And when they came back from that injury,
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.200]   they did indeed manage to improve
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.880]   beyond the initial non-injured state they were in
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.920]   before the injury, which is pretty remarkable.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.100]   But as this colleague pointed out to me,
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.080]   they were very careful to include
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.840]   a lot of mental training and visualization
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.680]   during that quote unquote layoff period.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.000]   So again, mental training better than no training,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.840]   physical training better than mental training,
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.360]   but when we say physical training
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.860]   better than mental training,
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.280]   what we're really talking about
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.780]   is when you allocate a certain amount of training hours
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.000]   for a given skill per week.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Okay, so how would this look?
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.620]   What these studies have done is they've said,
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.900]   okay, if people have the option
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.520]   of doing the real world training for 10 hours a week
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.360]   versus mental training for 10 hours a week,
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.680]   which group performs better?
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.760]   It turns out it's the ones that do the physical training
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.260]   for 10 hours per week.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.100]   However, we also know that combinations
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.600]   of physical training and mental training
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.680]   can bring about results that are greater
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.640]   than either one of those alone.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.540]   How would that work?
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.040]   Well, I wish I could tell you
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.880]   that if you did nine hours of physical training per week
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.240]   plus one hour of mental training,
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.000]   that your performance would be better
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.840]   than if you did 10 hours of physical training.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.640]   And that's not the case.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.480]   Okay, this is why we can reliably say
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.760]   physical real world training,
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.260]   and again, this could be in the cognitive domain,
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.000]   is always going to be more effective
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.240]   on an hour by hour basis compared to mental training.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.320]   So if you can do real world training,
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.000]   and perhaps we should be calling it real world
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.820]   as opposed to physical,
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:15.620]   but if you can do real world training
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.280]   compared to purely mental training,
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.340]   that's going to be the best use of your time.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.720]   This is really important.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.960]   And it doesn't underscore everything that we're talking about
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.340]   because here's the really cool thing.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:30.060]   If you do 10 hours per week of real world physical training,
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.900]   again, could be running, could be music, could be math,
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.980]   could be whatever it is you're trying to learn,
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.600]   shooting basketballs, hitting golf balls,
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.380]   and you add one hour or even half an hour
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.740]   of mental training to that real world training,
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.240]   well, then the results are significantly greater
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.840]   than you would experience with physical training alone.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.720]   And of course they would be greater
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.100]   than you could achieve with mental training alone
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.200]   because we already established
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.900]   that real world training is more powerful
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.600]   in learning skills and retaining skills
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.080]   than is mental training.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.480]   Okay, if any of that was confusing,
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.060]   let me just say it one more time just to be ultra clear.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:09.580]   If you have the option to do real world training
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.020]   for a cognitive and or motor skill versus mental training,
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.900]   always go with real world training.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.900]   However, if you can add to a maximum amount
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:23.620]   of real world training by doing some mental training
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.060]   and you follow the principles
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:26.660]   that we've been discussing here,
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.820]   which are gleaned from the scientific literature,
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:33.760]   well, then you are going to get significantly greater results
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.760]   in terms of speed, accuracy, and consistency of performance
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.820]   of those real world behaviors and cognitive abilities.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.180]   And of course, if you are unable to do physical training
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.500]   for whatever reason, injury, travel,
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.240]   whatever the case may be,
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.740]   well, then doing mental training
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.460]   is still far significantly greater
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.300]   than doing no training at all, okay?
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.340]   So total layoffs, it turns out, are a bad thing
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.580]   if you want to get better at something
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.500]   and indeed if you want to retain certain skills,
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.140]   both cognitive and motor.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.640]   Now, a couple of other things to keep in mind
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.060]   as you're thinking about how to build up skills
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.900]   through a combination of physical and mental training.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.780]   Well, remember back to the beginning of the episode
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.380]   where we talked about neuroplasticity
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.060]   and the fact that self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.100]   which is really what we're talking about here
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.620]   in this entire episode,
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.580]   things that you're trying to learn in a deliberate way.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.280]   That is, as you recall, a two-part process
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.700]   requires focused attention,
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.420]   both when you're doing it in the real world
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.200]   and when you're doing mental training,
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.980]   and it requires rest and sleep.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.900]   And in fact, you would be very wise
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.380]   to try and get a good night's sleep
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.820]   both on the days when you do physical training,
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.580]   again, also called real world training and mental training.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.580]   You may also be asking, can you do them on the same day?
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.900]   And this gets into some nuance in the literature,
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.380]   but by my read of the literature, here's the takeaway.
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.900]   If you are doing the maximum amount of physical training
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.460]   that you can do according to your schedule,
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.380]   preventing injury and all those sorts
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.040]   of important constraints,
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.500]   and you're going to add mental training and imagery,
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.660]   it doesn't really matter when you do it.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.660]   You could do it immediately after your physical training,
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.580]   you could do it on a separate day,
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.660]   but you do want to place it at a time
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.220]   in which you can try and get good sleep that night.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.900]   So for instance, believe it or not,
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.940]   studies have been done where people are doing mental training
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.640]   at times when they should be sleeping,
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.260]   that is going to offset some of the degradation
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.220]   and performance that you would normally see,
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.600]   but it's generally a bad idea.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.580]   You should do your real world training
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.260]   and your mental training whenever it is that you can,
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.780]   and then you should try and get as much quality sleep
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.340]   as you possibly can on the night following
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.900]   that physical and or mental training, okay?
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.980]   This is true of pretty much every night of your life, right?
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.440]   If I had my way, that is if I had a magic wand,
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.940]   which obviously I don't,
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.060]   I would ensure that I and everyone else in the world
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.300]   get sufficient amounts of quality sleep every single night,
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.340]   but that's just not realistic.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.860]   There are going to be times where that's simply
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.300]   not going to happen for whatever reason,
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.780]   and I always say, if you're not going to get
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.500]   sufficient amounts of quality sleep for whatever reason,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.860]   try and make it for a fun reason or a good reason,
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.380]   but I think getting sufficient amounts of quality sleep,
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.140]   80% of the nights of your life is a reasonable goal
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.320]   and one that's worth striving toward,
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.100]   and we have lots of episodes now,
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.460]   or three really, on mastering sleep,
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.780]   on perfecting your sleep,
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.900]   and guest episode with the great Matthew Walker,
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.100]   who wrote the book, "Why We Sleep,"
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.640]   incredibly important book.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.340]   All of those, as well as our toolkit for sleep,
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.100]   describe ways to improve your sleep,
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.360]   so you can refer to those episodes
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.940]   if you're having challenges with sleep
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.780]   and want to improve on sleep,
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.080]   and things like non-sleep deep breaths,
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.480]   which can support your ability to sleep
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.680]   and your ability to learn.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.140]   So sleep is still vitally important,
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.580]   not just for ensuring neuroplasticity occurs
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.180]   following real-world training,
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.020]   but also following mental training,
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.800]   and again, when you place that mental training
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.180]   is not so critical,
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.840]   or at least it doesn't appear to be based on the literature.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.280]   So if anyone out there has knowledge
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.140]   of any peer-reviewed studies stating
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.120]   that mental training should be done either before or after
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.220]   or some hours away from real-world training,
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.360]   please send that to me or put it in the,
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.280]   excuse me, put it in the comments on YouTube,
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.020]   and I'll see it there 'cause I do read all the comments,
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.740]   but I'm not aware of any such data or analysis.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.520]   And by the way, if you are interested in understanding
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.180]   the relationship between motor skill acquisition
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.460]   and retention and this first night phenomenon
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.680]   of sleep the first night after training
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.160]   versus sleep on the second night, et cetera,
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.120]   there's a really wonderful paper that was published
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.840]   by none other than the great Matthew Walker
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.360]   when I believe he was a graduate student,
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.640]   maybe he was a postdoc when he did this
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.240]   in Robert Stickgold's lab at Harvard.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.360]   The title of the paper is "Sleep and Time Course
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.160]   of Motor Skill Learning."
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.520]   This is a paper published in 2003,
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.240]   still an incredibly important paper.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.160]   I will provide a link to it in the show note captions.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.040]   It really highlights some of the key aspects
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.240]   of when people sleep and how critical sleep is
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.280]   on the night following and the nights following
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.640]   that training in order to really consolidate
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.400]   certain types of learning and what phases of sleep
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.740]   relate to the consolidation of motor learning, et cetera.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.680]   A really wonderful paper, and of course,
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.620]   but just one of Matthew and Robert Stickgold's
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:17.560]   incredible papers on sleep and learning.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.080]   Remember at the beginning of the episode
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.040]   when I mentioned that many people are good
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.600]   at mental training and visualization,
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.040]   but some people are not?
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.800]   Well, sex differences have been explored
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.040]   and age-related differences have been explored
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.480]   in terms of people's ability to mentally visualize
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.000]   and train up specific skills.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.980]   And while initially there were some sex differences
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:44.160]   identified, really the bulk of the subsequent literature,
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.800]   that is the majority of quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.560]   on this aspect of mental training and visualization,
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.320]   point to the fact that there are no significant differences
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.360]   between males and females in terms of their ability
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.980]   to mentally visualize, nor their ability to use
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.120]   that mental visualization toward improving cognitive
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.520]   or motor skills.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.840]   That point was covered in some detail
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.340]   in the review I mentioned earlier.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.640]   Best practice for motor imagery,
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.600]   a systematic literature review on motor imagery,
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.780]   training elements in five different disciplines.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.560]   This review also looked at age-related effects,
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.160]   and perhaps the only thing that really popped out
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.600]   from this literature review in terms of age-dependent
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.820]   differences that point to changes in protocols
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:24.600]   that you might make is that for individuals 65 or older,
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.500]   a combination of physical and mental training
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:31.500]   may actually allow them to gain and consolidate skills
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.920]   better than were they to do physical training alone.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.860]   Now, whether or not that's due to some lower upper limit
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.200]   of physical training that they can do because of their age
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.920]   or whether or not that's something specific to do
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.640]   with older versus younger neural circuits isn't clear,
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.720]   but what this review also makes clear
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.040]   is that for the vast majority of people out there,
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.100]   so teens, people in their 20s and their 40s and so on,
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.880]   physical training more effective than mental training,
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.840]   we said that before,
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.000]   combination of physical and mental training more effective
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.600]   than physical training alone provided the mental training
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.840]   is on top of the maximum amount of physical training
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.340]   that one could do, and of course,
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.200]   mental training more effective than no training at all.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.440]   Okay, so we talked about sets and reps.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.200]   We talked about, you know, five to 15 second epochs
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.500]   with about 15 second breaks in between,
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.200]   or rest between sets, if you will,
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.620]   repeated for 50 to 75 trials,
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:25.080]   done three to five times per week,
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.580]   some of the conditions of keeping it really simple,
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.500]   the importance of being able to actually perform
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.340]   those sequences in the real world, and so on.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:36.080]   What we haven't discussed is first person versus third person
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.260]   and eyes open versus eyes closed.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.500]   What are we really talking about here?
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:43.220]   Well, first person mental training and visualization
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.000]   would be where you are imagining doing something
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.500]   and you are seeing yourself doing something
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.420]   from the inside out, as opposed from the outside in.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.760]   Imagine, for instance, wearing a head cam, okay,
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.600]   or a body cam, and doing something with your hands,
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.960]   or being in virtual reality and having the sense
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.860]   that whatever you see in front of you
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.440]   and that's moving and that you're doing, that's you.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.100]   So what I mean by this is a mental training
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.740]   or visualization protocol, for instance,
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.840]   if you were at the piano or at a guitar,
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.160]   where you're actually looking down at
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.380]   or sensing the feeling of your hands,
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.080]   but you're not actually moving your hands, okay,
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.440]   as opposed to seeing yourself from outside of your body,
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.920]   so looking at yourself, say, standing next to you
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.240]   or from across the room, you're looking at yourself
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.180]   playing the piano or playing a guitar
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:33.820]   or swinging a golf club or doing a tennis serve, okay?
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:36.100]   First person versus third person.
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.980]   And what the data tell us is that first person
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.820]   mental training and visualization
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.620]   is generally more effective than third person
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.160]   mental training and visualization,
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.740]   which perhaps raises another chorus of does out there,
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.600]   but it needn't have been the case, right?
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.220]   I mean, you could imagine that seeing yourself
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.000]   doing something and doing it perfectly,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.560]   because you've done it perfectly once before, hopefully,
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.240]   would allow you to build up that skill more quickly
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.080]   because you have that third person perspective
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.360]   where you can really see every aspect and every element
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.720]   of what you're trying to perform.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.140]   Well, it turns out that the first person
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.740]   mental training and visualization
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.800]   is significantly more effective than that third person
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.480]   mental training and visualization.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.160]   So if what you're trying to learn lends itself well
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:24.040]   to this first person mental experiencing of self
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.520]   as you perform the cognitive and or motor skill,
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.020]   I suggest you do that as opposed to the third person version.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.320]   Now, what if what you're trying to learn
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.040]   doesn't lend itself well to first person visualization?
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.140]   For instance, what if you're trying to learn
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.780]   a specific cognitive skill that doesn't involve
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.960]   any overt motor behavior to be observed?
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.760]   Well, in that case, it's very clear
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.680]   that closing your eyes, ideally,
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.600]   and trying to perform that specific cognitive task
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.440]   or the statement or the uttering of a particular sentence
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.960]   in another language or doing some sort of computation
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.680]   or problem solving of some sort in your head,
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.520]   well, that itself, of course, is first person
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.040]   because it's inside your own body as opposed to,
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.880]   and I don't know that anyone would actually do this,
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.520]   but looking at yourself from a third person perspective
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.380]   in your mind's eye and seeing yourself perform
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.380]   that cognitive challenge,
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.080]   whatever that challenge may happen to be, okay?
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.920]   Now, we have to address eyes open versus eyes closed.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.120]   And this is where the literature gets pretty interesting.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.040]   I always thought, for some reason, I don't know why,
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.460]   but I presumed that mental training and visualization
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.040]   should always be done eyes closed.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.780]   But it turns out that's not how a lot of studies
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.440]   of mental training and visualization have been done.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.160]   And in fact, many of them have arrived
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.200]   at really impressive protocols,
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.600]   which are essentially the protocols that I've distilled out
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.160]   and I'm listing out during today's episode,
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.520]   having people either watch videos of themselves
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.720]   performing a given skill and imagining themselves
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.200]   in that role, and again, it's them.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.000]   So again, during the mental training and visualization,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.480]   they're watching a movie of themselves,
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.080]   so they're somewhat in the third person perspective.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.240]   I guess we could technically say
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.000]   they are in the third person perspective,
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.720]   but they're watching themselves.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.720]   So in doing that, we know, based on neuroimaging studies,
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:14.460]   that when we watch videos of ourselves doing things,
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.580]   we experience that more from a first person perspective
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.280]   than if we watch videos of other people doing things.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.200]   Use your imagination here, folks.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.600]   So if you're somebody, for instance,
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.300]   who's trying to get better at a particular skill,
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.780]   this could be not just sport, but also public speaking,
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.440]   watching videos of yourself doing that
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.240]   can be very effective, but of course,
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.760]   we have to come back to the first principle
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.120]   of effective mental training and visualization,
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.680]   which is that whatever it is that we're trying to build up
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.760]   or consolidate as a skill needs to be brief and repeated.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.940]   So what we're really talking about here
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:49.160]   is watching a video of ourselves on loop
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.340]   or listening to a audio or audio video recording
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.240]   of ourselves on loop for whatever aspect
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.520]   that we're trying to build up or improve upon.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.640]   Now, for people that, for instance,
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.120]   are trying to get better at dealing with public speaking
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.560]   and there isn't a particular skill
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.540]   or utterance of particular sentences
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.000]   or words that they're trying to accomplish,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   but rather they're trying to learn to be more relaxed
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.560]   or to articulate better in the public speaking scenario,
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.000]   there would be one of the few instances
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.200]   in which I'd suggest more general theme
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.360]   and not exact recapitulation of some specific words
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.260]   that you're going to say.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:30.080]   Perhaps it could be a sequence of you walking out onto stage
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.040]   toward the podium or out from the podium
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.520]   and facing the audience and looking in multiple directions
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.880]   up and down to see people in every corner of the room
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.920]   and just repeating that on loop in your mind's eye
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.940]   or watching yourself do that on video
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:45.620]   and making yourself calm in your internal state
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.880]   as you're doing that.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.760]   This is more of mental autonomic training
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.920]   because what you're really trying to do
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.180]   is control your autonomic nervous system,
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.340]   the nervous system aspect that controls how alert
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:58.780]   or calm you are, as opposed to a specific skill.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.140]   However, you could also translate this to dance steps
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:06.160]   or to motor sequences for playing an instrument and so on.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.800]   So the point here is that it's not as if there is
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.620]   zero utility to third-person mental training
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.740]   and visualization.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.540]   There can be, but first-person mental training
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.780]   and visualization is going to be more effective,
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:21.820]   as I mentioned before.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.540]   And if you are going to use
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.620]   the third-person mental training and visualization,
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:30.820]   ideally you would be looking at yourself either on video
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.660]   or listening to yourself in audio and/or video.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.740]   That is going to be more effective than closing your eyes
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.180]   and trying to imagine yourself
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.840]   from a third-person perspective in your mind's eye.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.020]   Okay, so just to make it really simple,
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.060]   first-person better than third-person visualization,
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.240]   if you're going to go with third-person visualization,
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.760]   try and go with real third-person visualization
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.120]   where you're actually seeing and/or hearing yourself
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.020]   on a screen.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.940]   And again, this was somewhat of a surprise to me.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.700]   I always thought that mental training and visualization
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.980]   was done with eyes closed.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.120]   I thought, okay, could you close your eyes?
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.020]   You imagine this, you imagine that.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:03.740]   That's actually not the case for many, many studies,
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:06.440]   some of which are considered real hallmark studies
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.120]   within the field of mental training and visualization
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.660]   and the different neural circuits that it recruits.
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:15.000]   And along those lines, there's a really interesting study.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.320]   It came out not that long ago.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.820]   This was just the summer of 2022.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.140]   I'd like to discuss in a little bit of detail
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.740]   because it really hammers home
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.140]   a number of the principles that we've talked about.
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:26.820]   The title of the article is "Mental Practice Modulates
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.900]   "Functional Connectivity Between the Cerebellum
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.700]   "and the Primary Motor Cortex."
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.700]   Going to tell you the essential features of this study.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:38.280]   First of all, primary motor cortex, sometimes called M1,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.360]   is a relatively small but vitally important strip of neurons
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.520]   in or near the front of your brain.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.520]   The neurons there are called upper motor neurons.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.780]   They communicate through a set of neural connections
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.480]   with what are called lower motor neurons.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.400]   The lower motor neurons sit in what's called
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.800]   the ventral horn of the spinal cord.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.880]   So along the spinal cord, you have sensory inputs
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.280]   coming from skin and muscle
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.040]   and what's called proprioceptive feedback
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.240]   that tells you where your limbs are
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.180]   in relation to each other and to yourself and so on.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.180]   You also have motor neurons that live in the spinal cord.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.880]   They're actually the ones that send little wires
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.320]   that we call axons out to the muscles,
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.800]   release acetylcholine onto those muscles
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.560]   and allow those muscles to contract.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.920]   Lower motor neurons are the ones
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.360]   that actually generate movement.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.240]   However, they are largely responsible
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.920]   for reflexive movements or already learned movements,
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.340]   and they require some input
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.140]   from things like central pattern generators
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:28.980]   and some other circuits
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.680]   within the spinal cord and brainstem.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.860]   But it's those M1, primary motor cortex neurons
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.300]   that are called upper motor neurons
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:38.680]   because they control lower motor neurons
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.560]   through directed action, okay?
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.880]   So when I say primary motor cortex,
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.520]   I'm really talking about those upper motor neurons, M1.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.000]   The cerebellum is an area in the back of your brain.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:49.840]   If you were to look at a brain,
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.060]   you'd see two little lobes back there
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.160]   that are highly foliated.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.480]   Foliated means that lots of folds
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.440]   and lots of bumps and grooves back there,
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.680]   and actually means mini brain.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.760]   It looks like a kind of a mini brain
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.100]   stuffed in the back of the brain.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:04.480]   In certain animals, the cerebellum is much larger
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.580]   than the rest of the brain.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.900]   In humans, the cerebellum is relatively small
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.860]   compared to the rest of the so-called neocortex,
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.560]   the outer shell, the human brain.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.260]   The cerebellum is involved in balance.
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.160]   It's also involved in eye movements.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.880]   It's also involved in timing and motor learning.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.380]   And the key thing to understand
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.380]   is that the cerebellum communicates
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.400]   with the primary motor cortex,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.360]   and it can do so through what's called inhibition.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.600]   It has outputs that inhibit the activity of neurons
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.460]   in the motor cortex and elsewhere,
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:35.100]   and that has a profound influence on the execution
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.480]   of motor behavior and the learning
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.540]   of particular motor behaviors.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.640]   Now, I don't want to get into too much detail
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.160]   around all this, but what you need to know
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.020]   is that the cerebellum communicates
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.180]   with M1, primary motor cortex.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.700]   M1 is primary motor cortex.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:49.700]   Those are the upper motor neurons
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.000]   that are going to control the lower motor neurons
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.220]   and are going to control physical behavior
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.440]   and execution of physical movements.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.820]   The communication between cerebellum
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:03.580]   and primary motor cortex is inhibitory,
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.320]   although it can activate motor cortex too.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.480]   And this gets into a little bit of technical detail,
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.280]   but there can be inhibition of inhibition.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.760]   So if you take something that's a break
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.960]   and you inhibit that break,
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.080]   what you end up with is more excitation, okay?
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.280]   So the takeaway here that's key
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.680]   and everyone should be able to understand,
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.700]   even though you may or may not be following
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:23.080]   this whole cerebellum primary motor cortex thing,
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.920]   is that when we gain a new skill
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.100]   or we get more proficient at a skill,
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:30.240]   so faster and more accurate,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.360]   there tends to be more net excitation
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.040]   of the cerebellum to motor cortex communication.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.920]   And that is accomplished by reducing inhibition.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.640]   So that's where it gets a little bit confusing to some.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.820]   But in this paper, what they did is they explored
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:50.560]   people's ability to improve on a very specific
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.880]   but very simple motor sequence.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.420]   It's one that you're already familiar with.
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:55.940]   It's that tapping sequence that I talked about before
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.280]   where the thumb is digit one, index finger number two,
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.000]   middle finger number three, ring finger number four,
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.380]   and pinky finger number five.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:05.880]   And it's a one, two, one, three, one, four, one, five.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.880]   One, two, one, three, one, four, one, five.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.920]   And they had people actually perform this
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.900]   and they measured their speed and accuracy.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:16.600]   And then they had them do a practice session
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.800]   that was either an intentional task,
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.380]   so one group just looked at an attentional cue
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.280]   and had to maintain focus on that attentional cue.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.300]   And another group did mental practice.
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.000]   They basically did 50 imagined trials.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.560]   So just in their mind's eye of this one, two, one, three,
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.740]   one, four, one, five on repeat.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:36.600]   Okay, 50 trials, much in the same way
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:39.580]   as what I referenced as the ideal protocol earlier.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.500]   Okay, 50 rounds of that.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.500]   Then they got tested again on the motor task
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.080]   in the real world.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.280]   And there were also recordings of the cerebellar
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.580]   to primary motor cortex communication.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.680]   So there were a bunch of different results in this study
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:54.600]   I think are interesting,
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.240]   but the ones that are most important are that, quote,
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.280]   we found that mental practice enhanced both the speed
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.060]   and accuracy of this one, two, one, three, one, four,
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.380]   one, five performance in the real world
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.460]   when people did these 50 imagined trials.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.720]   There are many results out there,
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:14.080]   different papers that parallel
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.020]   and essentially say the same thing
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.200]   as what is said in this paper.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.360]   And remember, there've been studies of mental training
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.760]   dating back to the 1880s.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.420]   But what this paper really does,
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.620]   it looks at the neural machinery
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.360]   and the changes in the neural machinery.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:30.680]   And what they found using transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.940]   both in the context of stimulating,
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.860]   but also recording activity and connectivity
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:37.220]   between cerebellum and primary motor cortex,
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:42.220]   is that mental training enhanced the net excitation
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:45.720]   of cerebellum to motor cortex communication.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.520]   That is, it reduced the inhibition in a way
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.680]   that allowed motor cortex to generate these movements
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.660]   with more accuracy and more speed.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.980]   What's also interesting about this paper
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.540]   is that it showed that the improvement
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:30:01.140]   in performance of this task was not related to activation
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.180]   of the motor pathways themselves.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.400]   So it's not the case that the cerebellum activation
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.960]   or inhibition changed the patterns of excitation
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.920]   going directly to the spinal cord
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.660]   because those pathways actually exist
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:16.160]   through a couple of intermediate stations.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.920]   What it really showed is that
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:19.800]   when people do mental training,
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.400]   and here you could say, okay, 50 trials,
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.240]   that's a lot of trials,
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.980]   but it's not actually that many trials.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.180]   It's pretty fast learning if you think about it.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.300]   Do a task in the real world,
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:30.220]   do 50 trials of the imagined task,
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.280]   do the trial in the real world again,
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.900]   significant improvement in speed and accuracy
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.480]   through now what are becoming
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.580]   to be established neural circuit connections
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:41.780]   between cerebellum and primary motor cortex.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.140]   Okay, so this study is one of several,
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:46.260]   but not a tremendous number of studies out there
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.760]   that are starting to really pinpoint
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.060]   the underlying neural circuits
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:51.260]   that allow mental training and visualization
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.500]   to really improve motor skill performance.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.120]   But again, and please hear me on this,
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.160]   in this study and in the vast majority of other studies
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.460]   that have shown significant improvement
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.900]   in motor performance in the real world
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.980]   by use of mental training and visualization,
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:08.700]   there was an ability of each and every one in the study
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:11.980]   to perform the specific motor sequence in the real world
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:13.660]   that then they were able to enhance
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.440]   with mental training and visualization.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.740]   Now, thus far, we've been talking mostly about performance
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:18.800]   of motor sequences.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.440]   And one of the things to really understand
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.920]   about performance of motor sequences,
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:25.340]   both in the real world and in the imagined context
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.680]   is that it involves the doing,
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.580]   that's what we call a go action
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.720]   and not doing certain things.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:33.780]   What do I mean by not doing?
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.260]   Well, for many tasks out there,
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.580]   even ones as simple as the one, two, one, three, one, four,
[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.740]   one, five tasks that we talked about a moment ago,
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:43.460]   there is the need not just to tap those fingers
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:46.060]   in the correct sequence as quickly as possible,
[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:47.420]   but also to be accurate about it,
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:50.760]   to not do one, three, one, four or one, three and four
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.580]   at the same time.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:53.680]   So there's both a go component, an action component
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.240]   and a withhold action component.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.480]   And the ability to withhold action
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.480]   is strongly constrained by the time domain.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:02.380]   In other words, the faster that we need
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:04.660]   to perform a given motor sequence,
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:08.180]   the more likely we are to perform incorrect components
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.360]   of the motor sequence as well, okay?
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.240]   So one of the key things about mental training
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.740]   and visualization that's really remarkable
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.760]   is that it can also be used and has been shown
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.420]   to improve not just go aspects of motor performance
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.340]   and cognitive performance,
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:27.180]   but also no go aspects of motor performance
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.340]   and skill learning.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:32.620]   Now, the go, no go thing is something I've discussed before
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.500]   on this podcast in reference to the so-called basal ganglia.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.940]   Basal ganglia are subcortical,
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.100]   so they're below that bumpy surface of the human brain
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.020]   that we're most accustomed to seeing
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   when we look at it from the outside.
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.740]   And the basal ganglia are strongly involved
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:51.780]   in go versus no go type tasks and learning.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.620]   Now, there are only a few studies
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.920]   that have really looked at the learning
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.980]   and the improvement of no go components of motor learning,
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:04.580]   but these no go components are really, really important.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.680]   In fact, if we were to look at what's involved
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:11.220]   at improvement in a golf swing or shooting free throws
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:13.320]   or getting better at piano or getting better at math
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.460]   or language speaking,
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.520]   I think it's fair to say that at least half
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.220]   and probably as much as 75% of motor learning
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:25.900]   is about restricting inappropriate movements or utterances
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.520]   or thoughts if what you're trying to learn
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.460]   is purely cognitive.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.380]   I think that's an important point
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:35.460]   that brings us back to our initial learning
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:37.700]   when we come into this world, that developmental plasticity,
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:42.460]   which as you recall, we have a lot of interconnected aspects
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.260]   of our brain and nervous system early in life.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:46.160]   Remember the example of the kid trying to eat
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.280]   and getting the spoon of food
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.400]   and bowl on their head, et cetera.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.860]   And then over time, getting more accurate
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:53.480]   at bringing food to their mouth and eating in a clean way,
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.140]   things that most, but not all people accomplish
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.300]   at some point in the course of their lifetime.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.180]   Well, there haven't been many,
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.540]   but there've been a few very interesting studies
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:03.900]   looking at how mental training and visualization
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.700]   can improve the no go aspect of motor learning.
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.260]   And I think this is important to highlight
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:12.700]   because it really mirrors what's done in the real world,
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:15.180]   as opposed to just the finger tapping type things,
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.600]   which are mostly go tasks.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.820]   Again, there's a little bit of a no go component there,
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:19.940]   but there are specific tasks
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.980]   that people have developed for the laboratory
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:25.020]   that really closely mimic action learning
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:26.760]   and cognitive learning in the real world.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:30.320]   And one of the more important of those
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.840]   is what's called the stop signal task.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.220]   Now the stop signal task is something
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:35.500]   that I'll explain to you.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.340]   I'll also provide a link in the show note caption
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.180]   so you can try it.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.200]   It's actually a lot of fun to try this
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.260]   because it really gives you a sense
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.420]   of just how challenging some of these laboratory tasks are.
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:47.400]   Let me just describe it for a moment.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.420]   The stop signal task was really developed and popularized
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.220]   by Gordon Logan and William Cowen.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.420]   Gordon Logan is at Vanderbilt University
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.060]   and has done a lot of really important work.
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.360]   But one of the important aspects of his work
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.120]   is looking at motor performance and skill acquisition
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.720]   and the development of the stop signal task.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.520]   I'll describe the stop signal task for you now
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.120]   in broad contour.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.300]   You or another research subject
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.040]   would sit in front of a screen.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.760]   There are two keys on that keyboard
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.420]   or two keys among the other keys on that keyboard,
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.640]   one which is designated left,
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.800]   the other which is designated right.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.560]   And then on the screen, you'll be presented, for instance,
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.240]   with a left facing or a right facing arrow.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.340]   So in the initial trial, what would happen is
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:31.500]   that arrow would pop up on the screen
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.460]   and your job is to press the left key.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.620]   When the right facing arrow is presented,
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.580]   you press the right key.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.900]   Okay, pretty straightforward.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.460]   But there's a limited amount of time
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.760]   in which you can do this.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.320]   And the idea is that you're going to need to do this
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.520]   within approximately 500 milliseconds
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.440]   of the presentation of that arrow
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.220]   or else it's going to tell you that you missed that trial.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.940]   Now, of course, if you press the wrong key,
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:55.860]   so if the arrow goes left and you press the right key,
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.520]   then you would be told you got that one wrong, okay?
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.620]   So this is a reaction time test
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.060]   and not one that's particularly novel.
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:06.380]   What's novel and what Logan and Cowan developed
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.660]   was that in the stop signal task,
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.420]   every once in a while, not every trial,
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:14.580]   but every once in a while, that arrow is presented.
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:17.600]   And then with some delay ranging from anywhere
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.880]   from 100 milliseconds to maybe 350 milliseconds,
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.620]   there would be a red circle or a red X also presented,
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.080]   which is a stop signal.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.820]   And your job is to not press the key
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.520]   that corresponds to the direction of arrow.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.160]   In fact, not press any key at all.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.680]   Now, you can imagine how if the stop signal shows up
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.020]   with a longer delay after the presentation of the arrow,
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:42.020]   there's a higher probability
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.020]   that you will have already generated
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:45.860]   the key pressing movement, okay?
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:49.380]   So at the link that we provide in the show note caption,
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.020]   you can actually do these two tasks.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:54.640]   And what you'll find is that you and most people
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.080]   will be able to do this arrow to reaction time
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.700]   pressing of the left to right key,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.340]   somewhere in the neighborhood between 300 milliseconds
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:04.040]   and maybe as long as 500 millisecond delay.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.140]   You'll get an average of how quickly you respond.
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.380]   And then of course, if you choose to,
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.600]   and I would hope you would choose to,
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.060]   go on and do the stop signal task,
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.280]   you will be told trial by trial
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.200]   whether or not you are hitting the right keys,
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.140]   because if you are,
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:20.860]   you'll be allowed to progress to the next trial.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:22.940]   Or if you are told to stop,
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.980]   that is you get the stop signal
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:26.100]   and you press the key anyway,
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.600]   you'll be told that you made an error
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.740]   because you did not stop.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.620]   Now, again, with very short delays
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.200]   between the presentation of the arrow and the stop signal,
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.340]   you are going to be much better at inhibiting
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.240]   or preventing yourself from the behavior
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.180]   at the no-go aspect of motor execution, that is.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:44.860]   What you will find is that if the stop signal
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.820]   is presented very shortly after,
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.020]   let's say 100 milliseconds,
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:50.220]   which is a very, very brief amount of time,
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:51.740]   after the presentation of the arrow,
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:53.880]   there's a good chance that you're going to be able
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.620]   to withhold the key pressing behavior.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:00.740]   However, if the delay is anywhere from 200 to 350 milliseconds
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.920]   after the presentation of the arrow,
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:05.640]   chances are that you're going to press the button
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.140]   even when you shouldn't have
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.320]   on at least some of those trials, okay?
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.360]   And if you try and game the system
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.600]   and wait a certain amount of time
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.500]   after the presentation of each arrow,
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.680]   there will also be times in which the stop signal
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.720]   does not appear and you fail to hit the button
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.440]   in the appropriate amount of time.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.420]   So it's a fun little task.
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.780]   It doesn't cost anything
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:26.100]   except maybe a couple of minutes of your time.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.680]   And if you do have time to go to it,
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.620]   I think it will give you a much deeper flavor
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.220]   for the sorts of experiments that we're talking about here
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:36.820]   and that you'll find that these stop signals
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.080]   are actually pretty hard to generate
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.980]   when you're trying to learn some new motor behavior.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.660]   And that actually illustrates a bigger point here.
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:45.220]   If today you sense that we've been talking about studies
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:48.580]   of tapping fingers and stopping button presses
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.860]   and that those examples are highly artificial
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:54.220]   and don't really translate to the real world,
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:56.860]   well, keep in mind that the tasks that are used
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:00.240]   in these studies really target the specific neural circuits,
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.840]   that is the same neural circuits
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.100]   that you would use for the performance
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.760]   of essentially any motor task.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.240]   Now, of course, other motor tasks,
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.480]   like ones where you involve your feet or cognitive tasks
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.160]   where you have to think really hard
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.780]   about specific information and search for that information
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:14.860]   and assemble it in particular ways,
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.440]   of course, involve other neurons and neural circuits
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.900]   that we haven't discussed today.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.860]   But the core components of these go and no-go task
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:22.980]   or the stop signal tasks
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.120]   really capture the core elements
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:29.060]   of most all of cognitive and or motor learning in some way
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.540]   that's fundamentally important, okay?
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.420]   So they have real world relevance.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:35.820]   The paper that I'd like to just briefly describe to you
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.280]   is entitled "Motor Imagery Combined with Physical Training
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.700]   Improves Response Inhibition in the Stop Signal Task," okay?
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.420]   So that title is a little bit wordy,
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:46.200]   but now you know what the stop signal task is.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.900]   And what this paper essentially found
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.060]   was that if people did physical training,
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.640]   so the sort of experiment that I just described,
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:57.380]   versus mental training where they sat eyes open
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:01.080]   and imagine their responses to those arrows and stop signals,
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.860]   but they didn't actually generate any key presses,
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.740]   versus a combination of the physical training,
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.320]   so the actual pressing of the buttons
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:12.300]   or withholding pressing of the buttons as the case may be,
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.780]   plus mental training,
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:17.520]   over the course of about five days,
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.980]   using the contour described of the key principles
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.940]   of mental training and performance that we've talked about.
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.040]   I'll get to the specifics in a moment,
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.900]   but it really obeyed most all of what we've talked about,
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:28.740]   if not all of it.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.860]   So repetition, simple, repeated,
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:33.100]   over about five days and so on and so forth.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.960]   What they found was that the mental training
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.180]   and physical training groups,
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.980]   so mental and real-world training groups,
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:40.900]   performed significantly better
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.060]   in the stop signal reaction time.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:45.940]   That is, they were able to withhold action
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.780]   when they needed to withhold action.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:51.060]   More frequently and with more accuracy
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.700]   vended either the physical training
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.220]   or mental training groups alone.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:57.860]   So this actually spits in the face of what we said earlier,
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:59.080]   which is that physical training
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.640]   is always better than mental training,
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.820]   and mental training is always better than no training.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.540]   And it's important to point out here
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.520]   that both the physical training
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:07.940]   and the mental training groups
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:10.660]   experience significant improvements
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:14.340]   in their reaction time and accuracy at the stop signal task.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:15.940]   But in the case of this study,
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.860]   which is exploring the withholding
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.820]   of inappropriate behaviors,
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.740]   the combination of mental training and physical training
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:26.900]   outperformed either physical or mental training alone.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.620]   So while earlier we said
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.900]   that if you have a certain amount of time
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:32.560]   in order to train something up,
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.740]   physical training is always going to be better
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.580]   than mental training.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.620]   Well, here we have somewhat of an exception
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:40.300]   where if the thing you're trying to learn
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.500]   involves withholding mistakes
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.280]   as opposed to trying to generate
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.060]   the right behaviors per se,
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:51.140]   well, then you are probably better off doing a combination
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:53.020]   of mental training and physical training.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.700]   Let me state that a little bit differently.
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:57.740]   If you're finding that you're screwing up something,
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.740]   not because you can't initiate
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.180]   that particular mode of behavior,
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:04.020]   but you're doing the wrong thing at the wrong time,
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.860]   you're not able to withhold a particular action,
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:08.360]   well, then in that case,
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.900]   mental training in combination with physical training
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.900]   becomes especially important.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.140]   So for you coaches, for you students out there,
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:17.320]   keep that in mind when trying to learn
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:19.880]   how to withhold particular action sequences,
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.300]   because they're not serving you well in the real world,
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:25.500]   using a combination of real world training
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.580]   and physical training is actually better for you
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:31.740]   on an hour per hour basis than is physical training alone.
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.580]   A couple of key details about this study
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.060]   should you decide to implement these protocols.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:39.860]   In this study, they did approximately 30 trials
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.420]   of the thing that they were trying to get better at.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.040]   Now they did those in the real world.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.200]   So in this case, the stop signal task
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.820]   involved actually pressing those buttons.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:52.820]   And then they had a test phase of about 144 GO trials
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:56.860]   and about 48 STOP trials, okay?
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:58.380]   So this is important.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.020]   If you are a coach or you're a student,
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:02.420]   or you're just going to self-direct this kind of learning
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:04.900]   in your self-directed adaptive plasticity,
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.100]   it's important that you mix in both GO and no-GO trials, okay?
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.380]   It wasn't always the case
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:11.340]   that there was a stop signal generated.
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:14.580]   The other thing that was really impressive about the study
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:16.700]   is that the changes occurred very quickly.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:21.180]   So the training was performed five times over five days.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.380]   So once a day for five days,
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:25.400]   again, back to this three to five times per week principle.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:30.020]   And the improvements were really significant in some cases.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:32.840]   In fact, if you decide to peruse this paper,
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.100]   you can go to table two and you can see,
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.700]   in some cases, a near doubling in the reduction
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:43.180]   in reaction time through a combination of mental
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.820]   and physical training compared to physical training alone
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.900]   or mental training alone.
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:49.840]   Again, however, both physical training
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.620]   and mental training groups alone
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:54.100]   saw significant improvements,
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:55.380]   but the combination of mental training
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:57.340]   and physical training was far greater
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:59.400]   than you saw with either one of those alone.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.540]   So that's all nicely quantified for you in this paper.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.160]   So again, I really like this paper.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.860]   Despite it not involving a huge number of subjects,
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:08.540]   I think it is a key paper because it really points
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:13.200]   to such an important element of motor learning and training,
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.720]   which is this action withholding component,
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.580]   this no-go component that here is captured so nicely
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:19.860]   in the stop signal task.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.940]   So before we round up our discussion
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:24.380]   about motor training and visualization,
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.220]   I want to just briefly touch on some of the studies
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.500]   that have explored why certain individuals
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:32.380]   are better or worse at motor training and visualization
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:34.220]   and what that might correlate with.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:35.540]   At the beginning of today's episode,
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:37.580]   I briefly mentioned aphantasia,
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:42.180]   which is this phenomenon where some people just simply can't
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:46.100]   or seem to have extreme challenge generating visual imagery.
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:49.000]   Been a number of studies exploring how aphantasics,
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:49.840]   as they're sometimes called,
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.840]   although nowadays it's not considered polite, if you will,
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.500]   to refer to people according to their condition.
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.680]   So for instance, propasagnosia is a condition
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.500]   in which people are unable to recognize particular faces.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.780]   And in the past,
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.060]   these people were referred to as propasagnosics, okay?
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:14.640]   As if their condition defined them, right?
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.580]   Nowadays, it's not considered polite to do that.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:20.340]   Rather, we say the person has propasagnosia
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:22.260]   or suffers from propasagnosia.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.840]   Although the word suffer then also
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.300]   has become a little bit touchy.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:26.620]   I'm going to do my best to just try
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.900]   and be as clear as possible here
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.300]   and explain that people who have aphantasia
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.500]   can have aphantasia to varying degrees.
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:36.780]   So they can either have a complete absence of ability
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:38.580]   to generate mental imagery,
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:42.460]   or they have a poor or kind of rudimentary ability
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.820]   to generate visual imagery in their mind's eye.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:49.600]   It was thought that people who have aphantasia
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.980]   are not capable of what's called synesthesia.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:56.440]   Synesthesia's are when people have perceptual blending,
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.540]   and this is not well under the influence
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:01.740]   of any kind of psychedelic or other kind of drug,
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:04.940]   perceptual blending of an atypical kind or rare kind.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.220]   I actually have some friends,
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:08.660]   I have two friends that have different forms of synesthesia.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:12.980]   One associates different keys on the piano or musical notes
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:16.140]   with specific colors in a very, very one-to-one
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:16.980]   specific way.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:19.780]   So they'll tell you that E-flat on the piano
[01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:24.780]   is a particular tone in their mind of amber hue, okay?
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:28.300]   And that I forget what other key is associated
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:31.620]   with a particular shade of red and so on and so forth.
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.180]   Are these people better at piano?
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:37.300]   Are they more perceptive of colors in their environment?
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:38.340]   Not necessarily so.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.820]   This is just a perceptual blending.
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:43.580]   It doesn't necessarily lend itself to any improved ability.
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:46.220]   Now you could imagine why people would hypothesize
[01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.660]   that people who have aphantasia,
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.780]   especially its extreme form,
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:54.500]   would not be capable of or have synesthesia's.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.020]   It turns out that's not the case.
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:58.240]   There are a couple of really interesting papers.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.840]   Again, we will link these in the show note captions.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.080]   One is entitled, "What is the relationship
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.260]   between aphantasia, synesthesia, and autism?"
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:08.900]   And the other one is "Aphantasia,
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:11.260]   the Science of Visual Imagery Extremes."
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:13.400]   And I really like to review aphantasia,
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:14.980]   the science of visual imagery extremes,
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:16.160]   for those of you that are interested
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:18.800]   in understanding aphantasia with more depth.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.420]   The study addressing the relationship
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:22.820]   between aphantasia, synesthesia, and autism
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:26.080]   found that aphantasia is indeed linked
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.860]   to weak visual imagery,
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:32.860]   but that aphantasia can also be synesthesia's and vice versa.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:36.280]   What was also interesting about this study
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.260]   is they address the question
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:40.540]   of whether or not people who have aphantasia,
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:42.520]   that is a challenge or inability
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.340]   to generate mental or visual imagery,
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.880]   tend to have features associated with autism
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.800]   or residing somewhere on the autism spectrum.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.420]   And I'm not trying to use ambiguous language here,
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:55.980]   but the whole set of language and nomenclature
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:57.760]   around autism and autism spectrum
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:59.620]   is also undergoing revision now,
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:04.080]   because we are now coming to understand that autism,
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:07.600]   and nowadays it's generally not considered correct
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.020]   to call people autistics in that sense,
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:15.020]   but autism is considered one set of positions
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:17.660]   along a spectrum that includes things
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.500]   like Asperger's, et cetera,
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.360]   but that may also include other aspects of cognition
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.680]   and even personality.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.140]   So these are starting to be viewed
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:27.500]   not just as a spectrum or one continuum
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:30.860]   ranging from non-autistic to autistic,
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:33.340]   but a lot of variation and subtlety in between,
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.920]   and even crossing over with other aspects
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.700]   of personality, psychology, and neuroscience.
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:40.200]   So I'm not trying to be vague here,
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.640]   I'm trying to be accurate rather by saying
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.300]   the whole description and categorization
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:46.940]   of autistic, non-autistic, et cetera
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.000]   is undergoing vast revision right now.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.540]   But the important point I think from this paper
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:54.260]   is that indeed it was found that people
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:58.340]   who have aphantasia tend to exhibit more of the features
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:01.620]   that are associated with the autism spectrum.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.060]   Now, how those things relate to one another
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.580]   in terms of their clinical relevance isn't clear,
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.820]   and of course it is entirely unclear
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:09.700]   as to what's the chicken and what's the egg there.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:12.480]   So you could imagine, no pun intended for instance,
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.120]   that people that are on the autism spectrum
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:20.120]   might be less proficient at generating visual imagery
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.580]   because they are exceedingly proficient at other things.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:27.240]   You could also imagine that people are placed
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.240]   onto the autism spectrum as it's sometimes referred to,
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.500]   or are associated with particular features
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:35.940]   on the autism spectrum because in a causal way
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.780]   of the aphantasia, and of course it's extremely important
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:43.360]   to highlight that not all people that consider themselves
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.280]   or that people consider autistic
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:47.660]   or that are on the autism spectrum or Asperger's
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:51.660]   or any variation thereof necessarily have aphantasia.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.100]   Just as it is that not all people
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:57.120]   that are on the autism spectrum completely lack
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.900]   or even lack what's called theory of mind,
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:01.460]   which is the ability to sort of empathize
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:05.620]   and ascribe feelings and motivations of others
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:09.880]   when viewing the actions and perceived feelings of others.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:12.260]   So what I just described hopefully doesn't come across
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:14.060]   as just a bunch of word soup.
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:16.060]   What I'm trying to pinpoint is that there does seem
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:18.500]   to be a relationship between one's ability
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:21.740]   to generate visual imagery and certain constellations
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:24.460]   of cognitive and emotional perception
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:27.180]   and behavior and vice versa, okay?
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:32.000]   In a future episode, I promise to cover synesthesia
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.900]   and autism and some of the related cognitive
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:39.260]   and motor aspects of autism and things like Asperger's.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.840]   I'm going to feature an expert guests
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:43.040]   or actually several expert guests in this area
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.100]   because it is a rapidly evolving
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:46.780]   and somewhat controversial field.
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.260]   Meanwhile, I think it's important to at least consider
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:52.540]   how mental training and visualization might relate
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:55.160]   to certain aspects of cognition and our ability
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:57.140]   to visualize things, not just in terms
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:59.660]   of other people's behavior, which is one of the common ways
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:02.420]   that people probe for autism and Asperger's
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:05.260]   versus non-autistic and non-Asperger's and so on,
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:06.920]   the so-called theory of mind task.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.740]   In effect, asking whether or not children or adults
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:12.220]   can really get in the mind of others.
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:16.220]   That's a typical task developed by Simon Baron Cohen,
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:21.220]   but also whether or not children and adults are capable
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:24.240]   of generating mental imagery in a really vivid way
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.520]   or whether or not they have minor
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:29.040]   or even extreme challenge in doing so.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.760]   And perhaps the most direct way to explain
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.280]   why I included this aspect of the discussion
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.900]   of mental training and visualization
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.740]   as it relates to different cognitive phenotypes
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:39.600]   or neurocognitive phenotypes,
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.020]   such as autism, Asperger's, et cetera,
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:45.100]   is because if you think about motor skill execution
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.340]   or cognitive skill execution and the relationship
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:49.020]   between mental training and visualization
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:51.260]   and motor skills or cognitive skills,
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:52.420]   that's all pretty straightforward
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:55.080]   when you're talking about finger tapping and go-no-go tasks
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:57.380]   and learning piano and things of that sort.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:01.740]   But in many, many ways, our learning of social cognition,
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:04.020]   our learning of how to behave in certain circumstances,
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.900]   what's considered normal or atypical,
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:09.500]   neurotypical and neuroatypical, if you will,
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:12.980]   a lot of that is not just generated from the inside out,
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:16.440]   but it also involves observation and visualization
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.580]   of what are considered appropriate and inappropriate,
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:21.340]   definitely placed in quotes, by the way, folks,
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:23.760]   I'm not placing judgment, I'm just saying appropriate
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.720]   and inappropriate for a given context behavior.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:29.760]   In other words, social learning and social cognition
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:32.300]   is every bit as much a learned behavior
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.200]   and pattern of cognitive and motor patterns
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:38.860]   as is tapping fingers or withholding key presses
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:41.400]   in a go-no-go task, it's just that it transmits
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:44.880]   into a domain that involves smiling versus frowning
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:47.280]   versus asking a question versus staying silent
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.180]   versus sitting still versus fidgeting,
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:52.860]   what's appropriate and when, what's inappropriate and when,
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:54.780]   all of that is what we call social cognition
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.740]   and has direct parallels to everything
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.560]   we've been talking about up until this point.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.060]   So today we did a deep dive,
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:02.080]   which is often the case on this podcast,
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:04.240]   into mental training and visualization.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.660]   During the course of the episode,
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:09.980]   I tried to lay down one by one the key components
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.540]   of an effective mental training and visualization practice,
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:15.280]   everything ranging from making sure that the practice
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:19.180]   involve brief epochs, repeats of specific sequences
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:21.200]   of motor and/or cognitive behavior,
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.000]   that those be relatively simple so that you can imagine them
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.500]   even if you're somebody who is not good
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.400]   at doing mental training and visualization.
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.400]   And I should mention that if you do mental training
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:32.120]   and visualization repeatedly over time,
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.660]   you get better at mental training and visualization.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:36.880]   There's a, what's called metaplasticity here.
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.900]   So it's not just about engaging neuroplasticity
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:40.100]   of particular circuits,
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:42.860]   it's also about getting better at engaging plasticity.
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.880]   So plasticity of plasticity.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.900]   I also described the key importance
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:51.380]   of being able to actually execute specific movements
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.580]   and cognitive tasks in the real world
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:55.900]   if you want the mental training and visualization
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.660]   to be especially effective.
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:59.540]   And we talked about the importance of naming things,
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:03.200]   we talked about the importance of creating not just one,
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.360]   but many parallels between real world training
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.380]   and mental training and visualization.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:10.640]   And really on the whole, what we established was
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.060]   that cognitive and/or motor learning really is something
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.500]   that you should do in the real world as much as possible.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.060]   But if you can't, due to injury or whatever conditions,
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:22.460]   using mental training is a reasonable substitute,
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.100]   but not a complete substitute.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.980]   And if you can't do real world training
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.640]   for whatever reason, injury or otherwise,
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.860]   that mental training is going to be better
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:33.100]   than no training at all.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.040]   And of course, we established that at least
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.280]   for withholding action in order to get better at a skill,
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:40.660]   a combination of physical training
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.480]   and mental training is going to be best,
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.400]   but that if you're trying to learn a new skill
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.080]   and you're having challenges with performing that skill
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.680]   because of an inability to do the skill in the first place
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.360]   or on a consistent basis,
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.040]   well then on an hour by hour basis,
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.280]   you're best off investing your time
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.800]   into the physical training,
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.680]   only incorporating mental training and visualization
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.840]   if you are able to do that on top of the maximum amount
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:07.320]   of real world training that you're capable of doing.
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.620]   And of course, we talked about the actual neural circuits
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.420]   and a bit about how the actual neuroplasticity occurs.
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:15.100]   Early in the episode, I mentioned long-term depression.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:18.380]   Well, in describing the improvements in no-go tasks,
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.060]   those stop signal tasks,
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:22.920]   a lot of what's observed during those tasks is improvement
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.700]   or rather an increase in long-term depression
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.780]   of specific neural connections.
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:28.900]   So my hope is that in learning
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:32.300]   about those basic neural circuits and plasticity mechanisms
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:34.460]   and in learning about the critical importance
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.820]   of focus and attention during learning,
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:39.020]   both real world and imagined,
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:42.140]   as well as the importance of sleep and deep rest
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:45.660]   for really consolidating learning and the different tools,
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:48.140]   the various steps or principles
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:50.520]   of effective mental training and visualization,
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.500]   that you now have a fairly coherent
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.720]   or maybe even a very coherent picture
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.560]   of how to develop the best mental training
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:58.740]   and visualization protocols for you.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:00.300]   I realize that everyone has different goals.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.300]   Everyone has different time constraints.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.680]   If you are somebody that's interested
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.160]   in developing a mental training and visualization protocol,
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:09.080]   so if you're a coach or teacher or simply a learner,
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.740]   or you're trying to self-direct
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:12.820]   your own adaptive plasticity,
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:14.940]   I want to emphasize that the key components
[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:17.420]   that we discussed today are essential to include,
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:19.780]   but I wouldn't obsess about whether or not
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:23.440]   a given epoch is 15 or 20 seconds or even 25 seconds.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:24.660]   I wouldn't obsess over whether or not
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:27.300]   you got 30 repetitions in and then your mind drifted
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.780]   or whether or not you could do the full 50 to 75
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.260]   or whether or not even in your mind's eye,
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:33.020]   you made some errors.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.480]   What's been shown over and over again in this literature
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.260]   is that performing mental training and visualization
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:41.120]   repeatedly and in a very restricted way
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:44.220]   that makes it easier to perform those trials
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:45.880]   over and over and over again
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:49.400]   and with a high degree of accuracy almost always.
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:53.100]   Really, we can fairly say in essentially every study
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:55.500]   where it's been explored has led to improvements
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.460]   in real-world performance of both cognitive
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:59.340]   and or physical tasks.
[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.120]   So if you're trying to learn anything at all,
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:03.160]   I do encourage you to explore motor training
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.780]   and visualization
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:08.100]   because basically all the studies out there,
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:09.800]   in fact, I couldn't find one exception
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.860]   where some degree of improvement wasn't observed
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:15.380]   when people use motor training and visualization
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:16.580]   on a consistent basis,
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.500]   even just the three to five times per week,
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.060]   these simple repeats over and over.
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:21.660]   So I don't want to over-complicate
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.780]   or make it sound like mental training and visualization
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:26.580]   has to be performed in a very precise way
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.320]   or that it has to be done perfectly each and every time,
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.620]   quite to the contrary.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:33.140]   What is clear is that mental training and visualization
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:36.320]   is a very effective way to improve real-world performance.

[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.300]   Not so much on today's episode,
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:10.100]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:11.300]   we discuss supplements.
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:13.140]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:15.700]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:19.100]   for things like improving sleep, for hormone augmentation,
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:20.820]   and for improving focus.
[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:22.700]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.000]   with Momentous Supplements.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.900]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements discussed
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:27.040]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:31.020]   please go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, .com/huberman.
[01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:33.720]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.420]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:39.340]   on social media, I am @hubermanlab on LinkedIn, Facebook,
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:40.740]   Twitter, and Instagram.
[01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:42.600]   And at all those places, I cover content,
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:44.320]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:45.380]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.200]   but much of which is distinct from content
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.500]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:51.780]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.220]   Also, I know many of you are interested
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:56.820]   in summaries of podcasts and what we call toolkits,
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:00.060]   which describe ideal toolkits and protocols for sleep,
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:02.860]   or ideal toolkit and protocols for neuroplasticity,
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:05.000]   or for deliberate cold exposure, et cetera.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.220]   For that reason, we've established
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:07.860]   what's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.860]   This is a completely zero-cost newsletter
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:12.480]   that you can sign up for by going to HubermanLab.com,
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.520]   go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter,
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:16.940]   and you sign up by providing your email.
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:18.980]   We do not share your email with anybody,
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:20.820]   and there are also some sample PDFs
[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:23.620]   of existing Huberman Lab Podcast protocols,
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:25.980]   again, ranging from neuroplasticity to sleep
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:27.580]   and other topics that we've covered
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:29.700]   in brief one- to three-page summaries.
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:32.340]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:35.340]   all about the science and effective implementation
[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:37.780]   of mental training and visualization.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.940]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:41.700]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:44.280]   [upbeat music]
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:46.860]   (upbeat music)
