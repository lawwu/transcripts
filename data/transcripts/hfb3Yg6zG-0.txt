[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020]   - I'm gonna just start off asking
[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.700]   what you think the biggest misconception
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.660]   people have about travel is.
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.620]   - I mean, I think the obvious answer, at least to me,
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.640]   is that people think it's expensive.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.340]   I think less so now because so much is on social media
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.640]   and there's so many blogs and it's talked about.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.700]   But I still think the vast majority of people will say,
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.560]   well, they don't really have time to travel.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.260]   But if you did, there's always time,
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.400]   but then they're like, oh, I just can't afford it.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.200]   Because people think, oh, plane tickets are expensive,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.360]   hotels, Airbnb, they just, they see all these commercials
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.880]   and this glamorized version of travel on social media
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   and they just think, well, that's pricey.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.060]   Travel is a luxury item, right?
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.000]   It's not a must-have thing.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   It's something you do to relax, to take a break.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.760]   And so there's this perception that this is expensive
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.800]   when it doesn't have to be because you always can go over
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.640]   to wherever you're going and just do the local things
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.800]   and the local things cost a non-touristy price.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.560]   And so I think if you ask people like,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.760]   well, how much do you spend in your own life?
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.000]   People have these very way off estimates.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   They usually have like a low, like they're on the lower end.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But if you get people to record all their expenses,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.220]   even like, oh, I bought a water bottle,
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.640]   that's a couple bucks, right?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.960]   Yeah, but you don't think of it.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.800]   People actually spend a lot more than they think they do.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.000]   And then when you balance that versus the price of travel,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.360]   it's oftentimes cheaper.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.600]   - Yeah, I mean, I live in the Bay Area.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.720]   So anywhere in the world I would go has to be probably
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.240]   cheaper except maybe Tokyo or a few cities.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.400]   So life other places is cheaper.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   And I experienced this actually,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.000]   it was probably almost 15 years ago.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.440]   We traveled for eight months
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   and we rented our place out at home.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280]   And we broke even or even kind of came out slightly ahead
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.720]   because it turns out we were spending more to live
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960]   in the Bay Area than we were spending to travel.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.600]   But I wanna get into some of those costs,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.920]   some of the ways you save money,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.600]   some of the tactics you have.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.560]   But I kind of wanna get started
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   and just ask how travel has changed for you.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.360]   I know you have been in this industry for longer than many.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.240]   And by industry, I mean writing
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.880]   and sharing your travels online.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.920]   You wrote a memoir about what you've learned
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.040]   after being a nomad for a decade.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400]   How have things evolved for you personally
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280]   and in the industry?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.880]   - Yeah, I started this when I was 25.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.920]   I started traveling the world.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.440]   So I'm 42 this year.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.360]   And so obviously my days of cheap meals
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.240]   and 12 bed hostel dorms is long gone.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.160]   I like nice food.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.680]   I, since I work when I travel,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.360]   having a place to work is really important.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   Having, getting a lot of good sleep is important.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.440]   So I tend to get my own room, hotels.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.800]   I take a lot more paid walking tours or food tours.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.680]   And so for me, the biggest thing is that
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.440]   my accommodation is a lot nicer.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.400]   I take more paid activities.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.160]   Whereas when I was 25, it was all about the free stuff,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.280]   the hostel dorms, cooking your own meals.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.440]   I still consider myself a backpacker, a budget traveler.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   You know, I take public transportation.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.000]   I love street food.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.800]   I still do parks and local things
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.560]   and go to the markets and all that jazz.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.120]   I'm not a resort guy.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.320]   I don't really do luxury.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.440]   I mean, it's nice, but it feels hard isolating to me.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.320]   So that's the biggest thing that's for me has changed.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.640]   It's sort of probably the nicer days.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.480]   And then how has travel changed?
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.760]   I think travel has become a lot more accessible
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.720]   than when I started traveling.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.600]   Both the ability to do it
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.040]   and the ability to find information.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.080]   You know, when I started traveling,
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.560]   the internet was just sort of taking off
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.440]   as a means of like finding information in the sense
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.680]   that you had like forums and like blogs
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.720]   and all these places you can go to ask questions
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.160]   about where do I find this hostel?
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.440]   How do I do this thing?
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.880]   And so I was still primarily using guidebooks
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.440]   as well as just asking around.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   But between social media and the advent of so many blogs,
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.680]   there's nothing you can't learn
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.200]   with a quick Google search, right?
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   There's no hidden restaurant, there's no hidden town.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.040]   Like, oh, have you been?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.400]   Yeah, there are places that are more well-known
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.280]   than anywhere else,
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.040]   but there's no place that's unknown
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.840]   in the age of the internet.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.960]   Somebody has been there
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.560]   and they posted an Instagram from there.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.920]   No matter like what little town it is,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.360]   no matter where it is.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   And so that is really great
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.400]   because it demystifies a lot of the travel experience.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.000]   It allows people to become more comfortable with going,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.840]   right?
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.160]   It's not so much of like you're going into the unknown.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.240]   It's like, oh, okay, I've heard of this place,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.400]   I've heard of this thing, so maybe I'll go there.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.280]   Even if you're like so scared
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.480]   'cause you're going to a place you've never been,
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.240]   it's no longer like this like fog out there.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.360]   - And then the advent of all these budget airlines
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.240]   and everything has made it just a lot cheaper
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360]   for people to travel.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.600]   - Yeah, I mean, sometimes one of the ways
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.800]   that I get inspiration is I'll just search on YouTube
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.000]   and it's okay, well, what's this place like?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It's like, here's a video of a person
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.960]   walking down the street
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.600]   and you can get a really visceral feeling
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.680]   for what it's like to be there.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.120]   And I remember when we first went to South and East Africa,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.880]   I had this one brat travel guide that was from 1998
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.920]   because it was like the only one that was,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.080]   we were traveling for long enough
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.400]   that I couldn't bring a book for each country.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.600]   So I was like, this was the one.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's like, you don't get a lot of feeling
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.640]   about what you're about to embark on there.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.480]   It was more of a directory.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.000]   - Yeah, guidebooks, even in the best of times
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.160]   are usually a year and a half behind what's going on.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.000]   - Yep.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.120]   - I never have used guidebooks as a price guide,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.760]   just more of a rough guide.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.120]   - Yes, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.440]   I think they're great about here's the part of town
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.560]   to look for, here's some ideas of how transportation works.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   But I'm curious, you said now that you've kind of
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.560]   gotten older, have done this a while,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.480]   your digs have gone up, you wrote the book,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.840]   people have referenced it in many ways
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.600]   about being like the guide for backpacking
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.440]   about traveling the world on $50 a day.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.720]   Do you think that still holds both in today's world,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.640]   inflation pandemic and as people age
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.200]   and wanna experience travel, not in a hostel with 12 beds?
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.040]   - Yes and no.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.640]   I mean, that book is never about the number.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.800]   A lot of people would get caught up on that,
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   like, oh, 50 bucks, good luck doing your way on 50 bucks.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.200]   I mean, you're traveling the world on $50 a day.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.640]   So it's a daily average.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.040]   Some places, totally, especially post COVID, strong dollar,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   India is still very cheap.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   Parts of Central America, Southeast Asia,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.680]   Eastern Europe, still very cheap.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   But your average place for a hostel in Western Europe
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.080]   is probably 30 euros now a night.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.920]   So it's very rare to see door beds, 10 euros, 15 euros.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.440]   They're still out there, but they're harder to find
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.640]   and they're less common.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.080]   And the beds are probably gonna be like 20 beds.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.680]   So if I, and I am going to redo this book
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.760]   probably for a post COVID, post inflation world,
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.280]   I'd probably up it to like a 65, $70 a day average.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.080]   If you're doing the quintessential round the world trip,
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.640]   you know, go to Europe, Southeast Asia,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.560]   Australia, New Zealand, South and Central America.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.400]   Yeah, and if you're coming from the US,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.840]   that's going to be even better
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.240]   because the US dollar is so strong right now.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.400]   Will that stay?
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.240]   Who knows?
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   When I planned my original trip around the world,
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.280]   I remember it was one US dollar got you $1.30 Australian.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.440]   So that's what my budget was based off of.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.080]   And by the time I got there, it was one-to-one.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   So I lost 30% of my budget because of that.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.760]   So like I had to readjust everything.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   So, you know, I mean, it's less about the number
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.880]   and more about the style, like the tips, the tricks.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   If you're just looking for ways to travel cheap,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.160]   forget about the number,
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.560]   just use the strategies in the book.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.520]   - Okay, so let's talk about some of those strategies
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.720]   'cause I liked how you actually broke it down.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.920]   It wasn't just, there are a bunch of strategies,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.760]   go have a great trip.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.200]   It's here's what you specifically need to know.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.840]   So how would you walk someone through
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.000]   the high level of planning a trip like this
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.280]   with the goal to do it on a budget?
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.520]   What are the kind of key strategies
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   you think people need to follow?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.480]   - I think the biggest thing for people is one, travel slow.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.120]   The more you can sort of spread out your costs,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.280]   the better it will be.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.720]   If you're moving around a lot,
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.480]   you're gonna have high transportation costs
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.240]   and that really can eat into a lot of people's budgets.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.320]   But the big thing is just really being flexible
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.240]   because if you can wait for that deal to come,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.560]   then you're not tied into like,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.240]   I have to get this flight on this day to this destination.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.040]   And so one of the benefits of long-term travel
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.120]   is that you're in no rush to do anything.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.040]   You can wait for that flight deal, that hotel deal,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.320]   or you can find a flight deal or a hotel deal
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   and be like, that's where we're going next
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.720]   because that's where it's cheapest.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.640]   And so big picture, always be flexible.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.680]   Second big picture thing is to travel like you live.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.800]   You in your daily life, cook food,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.100]   you don't eat expensive food all the time, restaurants,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.440]   you look for free activities,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.940]   you take public transportation, you go for walks.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.800]   Do the same when you're traveling.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.480]   If you really wanna get a taste of local life,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.280]   go to the local farmer's market,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.800]   go take the train or the bus,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.920]   go for a walk, sit in a park.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.640]   Travel doesn't always have to be about doing things.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.600]   It can be more about just existing in a place
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.120]   and soaking up the vibe.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.600]   And so if you travel like you live,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.320]   you're gonna end up doing all the things that locals do
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.720]   because what people do in Berlin
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.920]   isn't different than what people do in the Bay Area
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.440]   or Austin.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.680]   Everyone gets up and goes to work and takes the train
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.400]   and goes grocery shopping
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.560]   and lives their day-to-day life and then walks.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.040]   Maybe it's just by the river,
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.800]   they do something, sit in the park.
