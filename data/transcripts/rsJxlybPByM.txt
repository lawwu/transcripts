[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   The thing with the U.S. is a lot of its economic potential is put into stop by stupid regulations,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.360]   zoning, nuclear regulations. The thing is, once you have bombs dropping across London,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.400]   it'll be very obvious that these things have to go. These sort of things are a luxury belief
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.960]   for vested parties. No elected leader is going to listen to the people who are currently harming
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.040]   American or British or German industrial capacity. They're going to say, "It sucks about the
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.720]   pollution, but we've got to wash it away." But I also joke to my friends that among our circle,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.840]   I'm the best at evaluating talent because all my tutor mutuals end up getting famous.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:52.640]   Okay. Today, I had the pleasure of speaking with Pradumna Prasad about the book,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.080]   Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan by Herbert P. Bix. Pradumna is an incredibly
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.680]   smart young guy. He has a blog and a podcast called Bread and Goods, which you can find at
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.680]   breadandgoods.substack.com. Cool. All right. Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.040]   Pradumna Prasad, who recently graduated high school in Singapore. And now, he just received
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.200]   an Emergent Ventures Grant very recently to continue work on his great podcast and blog.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.400]   Excellent. Excellent. So yeah, you got the Emergent Ventures Grant. What are your plans?
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   What are you doing? What am I going to do with it? At the moment, I'm working on a bunch of stuff on
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   reserve currencies. It has been an obsession of mine for a very long time. So all the reading is
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.840]   going to end up in writing at some point. On the longer term, I want to have a blog where I can
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640]   answer every single economic history question or economics question I don't know the answer to,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   and nobody else has the answer to, I can answer it here. So pretty much going to be a mini
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   encyclopedia of questions I'm interested in. Excellent. Excellent. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.720]   forward to it to produce. And for the time being, today, we're discussing this book you recommended
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.920]   to me, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan by Herbert P. Bix. And so just to give a little
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.440]   bit of context, well, actually, just let's just say who Hirohito was, right? He was the Japanese
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:36.640]   emperor. He was the third emperor after the Meiji Restoration. He was the first one to see Japan as
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.920]   an international power. He was the first and last one to handle it as an international power.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.600]   And yeah, Hirohito was the guy responsible for a lot of stuff that happened in East Asia across
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   the mid-20th century. Right. Including, by the way, World War II, right? So he was the Japanese
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   emperor during World War II. And there's a big controversy around Hirohito, because he was in
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.160]   charge of Japan during the time that Japan invaded China and committed all the atrocities that we
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.000]   know happened there, including the rape of Nanping. And he was also the Japanese emperor
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   during World War II, during Pearl Harbor, obviously. So the book takes a very critical
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.600]   stance on Hirohito. It claims that Hirohito could have stopped, or at least in many ways dulled,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   these atrocities. He had that authority. The opposite view, I guess, which is the conventional
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.360]   view, is that Hirohito was kind of a constitutional monarch, much like a British monarch, and that he
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.120]   didn't really have the authority to intervene in politics. And then to the extent that he did,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.600]   he did his utmost to lessen the impacts of the war, for example, by surrendering in 1945.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   So now, what were your overall impressions of the book, of how well he did defending the
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.800]   thesis that Hirohito should have been tried as a war criminal? Yeah, no, I think the book sort
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.600]   of goes like a synthesis of these two. It says that Hirohito was a constitutional monarch,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.320]   but he was a constitutional monarch because he chose to be a constitutional monarch. So yeah,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:20.400]   in theory, on paper, he couldn't do it. It's one of those things where Japanese constitutional law
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.080]   wasn't very well done. I mean, for any anarchy, constitutional law isn't well done, and much more
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.840]   so for Japan. But Hirohito could have done something he did not. He chose to be a constitutional
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.560]   monarch. So anyways, the book was well written towards the end, poorly written towards the
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.080]   start. I think the difference between a collection of events and a biography is a story, and there
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.880]   was no story at the start. So I think that book could have been much improved. But I also think
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   that it's very hard to find people who read through original language sources, in this case,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.720]   Japanese into a very small extent, Chinese and English, and then put it into English. So I think
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.680]   the author deserves a lot of commendation for that. Okay, excellent. Yeah, yeah. So I agree.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.000]   The most interesting part about the beginning, and I agree it was pretty dull, was the author
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.480]   talking about how much Hirohito was influenced by his grandfather, Meiji. Meiji was the emperor
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.760]   during the time where Japan rapidly, rapidly, rapidly industrialized, and went from being a
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:42.560]   semi-colonized power to becoming a colonial power itself, having colonies in Korea and Taiwan under
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:53.200]   Meiji. So it's very interesting. I have one friend who thinks that many of the differences you see
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.520]   between countries can be explained largely by genetic differences. And I think one of the
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.920]   strongest counter arguments to that is just how different Japan has been over the last 150 years,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.200]   how many different evolutions it's gone through. And whenever you see these stories of rapid
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.400]   industrialization, you can kind of understand how it can happen over many hundreds of years.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   How it happens in the case of Japan during the Meiji Restoration so fast, it kind of suns me.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.960]   So I know you've been doing a lot of reading on Chinese industrialization as well as industrialization
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.840]   in many other East Asian countries. Can you explain what happened during the Meiji Restoration? How
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.520]   did they get everything up and running so fast? Right. The main difference between the pre-1868
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.240]   Japan, which was called the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Meiji era, was that Japan had a lot more
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   centralized power. There was one king running the place instead of feudal lords all over. Japan was
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:58.560]   a lot more open to the rest of the world. There was the death penalty for Japanese who interacted
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.960]   outside of Japan during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Very, very brutal in today's words. And Japan
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.360]   basically did what would be called the holy trinity of industrialization. It had open labor
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:19.280]   markets, government investment, and basically allowed foreign capital to come in. Across East
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.520]   Asia and across parts of Africa, like Botswana, and to a smaller extent, South Africa and Nigeria,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.240]   the best way to get rich historically for countries, when there are already other rich
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:38.160]   countries, is to take all the capital from the rich countries, copy their innovations, and use
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.000]   all their knowledge on how to get rich to get rich yourself, and then start to slowly push away on
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.880]   their hegemony. And the results of it are somewhat mixed. The US did okay as well, Japan didn't do
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.000]   well, and we're seeing it with China now. Is there any particular reason it happened first in Japan,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.600]   as far as the East Asian countries go? I'm not a very good source on this, because I try to avoid
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.320]   the historiography of this, because it's full of too many details. Historians haven't done a very
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:23.040]   good job of it. But my take on it is that I think it's very much elite-dependent. First is that the
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.160]   Japanese elite didn't have as much of a rent-seeking class as the Chinese elite did. In China, because
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.080]   the country was so big, they invented a whole bureaucracy to administer it. The problem was,
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.480]   you end up leaving too much power to the people in between you and the general public. So they
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.880]   ended up being the barriers to modernizing and opening up. But in Japan, that was less so.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.240]   The second thing is, Japan already had a small tradition of worshipping the emperor's god,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.040]   and became politically convenient for the shogunate to now re-emerge. They actually
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.080]   had a small civil war, and it so happened, and it's just an accident of luck that the
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.120]   winners of the civil war happened to be the ones who wanted to open up and make Japan great again.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.000]   So one part is that. The second thing is, being a small island nation really
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   makes you see the realities of life much clearer. One explanation for why small countries
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.280]   would have better economic policy than large countries is that if you're a small country,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:38.160]   the realities of life are very often more in your face. So when Japanese elites saw the American
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.520]   ships coming, they're like, "Whoops, we can't afford to be irrational anymore about it,"
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.480]   and they were forced to modernize. Compare that to a lot of East Asia, where they either
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.320]   could live in their own alternate reality. For example, the Indian kings and the Qing dynasty
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.200]   in China. The Japanese were just forced to deal with reality a lot faster.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I also read on your recommendation, Lee Kuan Yew's
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:16.400]   biography. This is not the book we're discussing now, but just to tie it with this, it was really
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.440]   interesting to read him just go over all the different issues Singapore had to deal with
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.120]   at when it got started. The fact that it had hostile neighbors, the fact that basically it
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.360]   was going to lose 25% of its GDP once the British left for their naval bases. There's something
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:41.360]   about the fact that you're just on an island, open to all the elements basically that I guess
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.720]   concentrates the mind. Exactly. A very underrated measure of
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:55.040]   leader competence is how close to reality are you? And you see it, to skip to 2022 today, you saw it
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.240]   over the last two years where leaders were more in touch with reality, respond faster to COVID,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   got better vaccines, tighten up faster, but also open up faster. So basically the Japanese elite
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.840]   in the 1860s was a lot more in touch with reality than other countries. And so they knew they were
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:21.120]   forced to open up. The next part of it was they opened up and they opened up quick. They got
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.400]   American industries to come set up in Japan. And basically a lot of the history of economic
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:35.120]   development is also the history of intellectual piracy. They just had what is euphemistically
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.080]   called forced technology transfers so they can learn how to make all the cool gadgets that the
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:47.760]   Americans had. And by around the 1910s and 1920s, they got rich enough to project their power onto
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:56.080]   the rest of East Asia. By 1905, they fought a war with Russia. And then in 1950, around the same
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.280]   time, they invaded China. And then later they invaded China again. They just didn't deal with
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:09.360]   the sudden transitions of being a power that is coerced by the Americans to a power coercing other
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.160]   countries. Right. Now, I mean, there's a way you can view this where, I don't know, if you have
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.640]   that kind of transition happens slowly in a country, you can have norms evolve from, I don't
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.240]   know how to put this in a way that's not derogatory, but norms that are very kind of brutish
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.200]   and very much geared towards like traditional norms of war, which is like you destroy the enemy,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   you pillage and you loot, which is like, which might make sense if you can like loot a village.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.240]   Right. But when you're talking about the capacity of a modernist or a war, and you can do that to
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.120]   like millions of people, that can become extremely brutal. And I don't know, it seems like in the
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.440]   West, once industrialization happened, there was like enough time for things to simmer down
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.720]   before these countries were introduced to the worst weapons. And you could argue that the World
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:05.200]   Wars are a counterexample. But even still, on the Eastern theaters, sorry, I mean, the Western
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   theater, there just weren't the kind of atrocities that you saw the Japanese make in the Pacific
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.360]   theater and in China. So like one of the downsides of rapid industrialization is your cultural norms
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.080]   don't catch up to your technology. And so you have like almost these, these people who have like,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.000]   very, very traditional norms around war with very modern weapons, and it gets pretty scary.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.840]   I agree with what the scholars say, it's a very good essay on honor culture versus respect versus
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.800]   justice. I'm paraphrasing here. But overall, less industrialized societies have strong patriarchal
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.360]   cultures, because for better or worse, it's the men who end up doing the work, and they got more
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.160]   of the respect. And there's a lot of debate and literature about it, but that's more or less my
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.920]   understanding of it, right? So you're right that the norms don't catch up. But I think you're wrong
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.520]   that even in the West, the norms didn't catch up for a long time, right? Think of colonialism,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.560]   only very, very few people in the House of Commons thought they should impeach Warren Hastings for
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:20.080]   his atrocities in East India, through the East India Company. So it's not only in Japan that
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.560]   norms didn't catch up, it's almost everywhere that norms didn't catch up. Norms take a lot,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.680]   lot of time to catch up. And in Japan, well, the first thing is that the Japan you see today is
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:38.080]   artificial in the sense that it is an artifact of the Americans jumping in and putting a gun to the
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.840]   Japanese cabinet and saying, "You better accept the constitution we make." And some parts of the
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.480]   Japanese left really liked it, some parts didn't, but it basically forged a coalition of only people
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.840]   who liked it, and people from the old regime who were willing to accept the new reality. So norms
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.040]   can change quick, but when they do, they change with the barrel of a gun, not by some internal,
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.200]   organic cause. Ask your question of why was there so much atrocity? You are correct in saying that
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.920]   norms didn't change, but I also think that public choice theory is what explains a lot of
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:21.840]   Japanese war crimes across the 1900s, I mean, the entire early 20th century, right?
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.600]   My entire understanding of the book was that it could have been written by any public choice
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.880]   theorist and would have ended up the same. So let's think of it this way. The Japanese army
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.920]   was powerful historically from the 1860s. They fought a war in 1905. They were always scared
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.520]   the Soviet Union, after it was formed, was going to invade them as historical vengeance, also
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.600]   because it was just a lot better run than the Stalinist Russia. The problem was the depression
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   hit, and then the army and navy got mad that their spending was cut. They just kept inventing
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   problems in East Asia for them to have their budget increased. And some part of inventing
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:11.520]   problems involves lying about them. All large bureaucracies exaggerate their problems, but the
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.880]   army took the more extreme step of creating problems itself. And then they're like, "We
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.040]   created this mess, and we need money to solve it, or else you're going to die." And then the
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.680]   Japanese government was weak enough to give them money and got drawn into World War II.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:35.520]   Yeah. So let me just fill in the details for the audience. So in 1931, in a Japanese-controlled
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.360]   Manchuria, the Japanese military stages a sort of attack on one of their railroads, if I remember
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   correctly. And it's pretty obvious it's staged by the military. It's not even that big of an
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.800]   attack. Sorry, it's staged by the Japanese military. And it doesn't cause major damage,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.520]   but the military then uses that justification to invade the rest of China without permission from
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.760]   the emperor or with the rest of the civilian government. But yeah, so basically what you have,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.280]   and then so public source here comes in because you have these political factions in Japan who
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.800]   are trying to control the Japanese policy, not in the best interest of Japan itself, but because of
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.840]   what is in the best interest of themselves as a faction. In fact, I interviewed Richard
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   Hinenia recently on my podcast. And as you know, he has a book out called Public Choice Syria and
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.720]   the Illusion of Grand Strategy, where it makes exactly this point where he's arguing that the
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.480]   unitary actor model does not apply to nation states, because they're very influenced by these
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.000]   sorts of factions and individuals and special interest groups, like, for example, the military
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.240]   in the military, and then specifically the imperial way faction in Japan. But there's many
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.760]   examples of this or like, army officers just like kill the prime minister at one point, and I think
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.240]   it was 1936. And when they go to trial, they just say, yeah, we did this work, because we're like,
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.480]   well, the emperor and the prime minister was, you know, he wasn't nationalistic enough. And they get
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:10.160]   like very light sentences. It's called the government by assassination. But the government
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.920]   was like at this time, I agree a few things here, right? The first thing is that Japan had a very
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.040]   unique constitutional model, as far as it could be called a constitutional model, which is just
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:29.360]   ad hoc, as you know, a big problem in people's understanding of history is that they don't they
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.480]   just don't realize that a lot of times big events are just some guy deciding things. And so a lot of
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.920]   these things end up exactly as you would expect some guy who ended up deciding them. And so the
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.760]   big problem here is that well, the way the Japanese constitution was designed was that
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.120]   the civilian government more I mean, elected by by men with property, I don't remember the exact
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:57.680]   details. They had control only over every part of the government except the military. And most
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   countries like in the US, you have a requirement that all defense secretaries should not have
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.920]   served in the military, or if they have served there, there has to be some something a five year
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.280]   seven year gap to ensure that you have civilian control on the military, right? But secretaries
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:19.440]   can't have certain? No, no, you have to have a five year gap or something. And if you don't meet
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.640]   that gap, you have to get a waiver from Congress. Okay. I didn't know that. Yeah. Okay. So that's
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.400]   to maintain civilian control on the military. And a lot of countries don't do very well on that,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.600]   right? To go a sort of a tangent, Pakistan is one of those places where you're very poor civilian
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.800]   control on the military. So the military just keeps like doing stuff and the government is
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.600]   forced to react to it. And then in most Western democracies, it's the other way around the crazy
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.200]   Western does something and the military is like, whoops, now we're now we're in this war, and we
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.840]   got to deal with it. In Japan, the problem was your army ministers were well part of the army,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.280]   they weren't representing the civilian government, they were representing the the army. Give an
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:06.400]   example. It's a funny thing. The Indian ambassador. So in the 1960s, India was having a was always
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.760]   having high tensions with China, which ended up in a war in 1962. I think it was VK Menon who was
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.800]   India's ambassador to China. And you know, VK Menon came and told Nehru, you know, this happened,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.560]   that happened, Chinese won this and Chinese won that. And Nehru asked him quite annoyed. Are you
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.880]   our ambassador to them? Or are you their ambassador to us? And it's the it's the it's the same problem
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.040]   with the army minister being part of the army. Is he representing the civilian government or the
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.080]   or the army? Nobody knows. And that led to a sort of elite capture of the civilian government by the
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.920]   army. There's another great book, I forgot the title, but it was discussed on on China talk a
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.320]   lot. And basically explains that the army took control of the entire civilian government basically
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.640]   said you got to prepare for total war. Why? Because we said so. And they basically and
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:06.000]   they reorganize the functions of government a lot to to achieve this objective.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.320]   Yeah, yeah. There's a there's like a pretty well known quote about the Pakistani military,
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.720]   which can be applied equally as well to Japan in this era, which is that in most countries,
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.560]   the government has a military in Pakistan. And I guess in this case, Japan, the military has
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:30.560]   the government, right? Yeah. That's what's playing into here. And the claim of the author is that at
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.560]   various points where the military power is growing, and it's doing more and more audacious things,
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.720]   it's like directly contradicting the will of the civilian government. The civilian government says,
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   like, hey, what are you doing, like invading these other parts of China, like, you know, stop this.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.400]   And the military leaders are just like, yeah, fuck it, we're going in. And so at this point,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:57.680]   the bigs is like, the author, he's like, the emperor, who's like, he has a unique role here,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.200]   where he has such moral authority, because the army is claiming to like, in the US, it's not
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.280]   like if there was, if there is a sort of like military coup, assuming the president's not in
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.880]   favor of it, the government, the army military is not going to be like, we're doing this in the name
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.000]   of the president, right? Whereas in Japan, it was like, well, for the glory of the emperor,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.520]   and the empire, we're, you know, we're going to invade. So the bigs is like, yeah, he could have
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.200]   just been like, yeah, this is not in my name, right? And he doesn't do that. He issues like
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.640]   these very mild, if at all condemnations, whenever these kinds of things happen. And so they keep
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:41.200]   escalating and escalating. And so yeah. Yeah, so a few things about that, right? So a lot of it,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.560]   there's a question in waiting about history is how much of it is contingent on,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:54.000]   you know, structural forces, and how much of it is contingent on actual people. And foreign
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.040]   policy is one of the three places of history where things are contingent on actual people.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.080]   And one of those actual people was Hirohito. The problem with Hirohito was that even as a child,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.280]   he was very mild mannered. His tutors described him as, you know, he wouldn't win any debates,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.200]   was a very good public speaker. And the Japanese government and Japanese state,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.840]   very different than Japanese government, very concerned that the public support for the emperor
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.640]   was going down. So they went to England to learn how England did it. And the problem was
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.440]   that Hirohito was not the right person for this job, because the job demanded a little closer to
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.760]   what a modern day politician job demands, a lot of public opinion formation, a lot of, how to put
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:51.360]   it, dealing with various factions inside, and, you know, lying to a lot of people and keeping them
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.840]   quiet. But Hirohito was just not politically suave enough to do it. And that was the clear problem
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:04.800]   here was that he didn't understand, even if he understood, he didn't understand clearly the level
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.200]   of impact he had. And he had this personal team's mindset of, we've probably linked to this,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.600]   he had this personal team's mindset of like, it's not worth it. But then, you know, that's what led
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.680]   to his downfall in the end. To what extent was Hirohito responsible for this? My answer is,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.480]   it depends on your definition of responsible. Could he have stopped it? Probably. Could he
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:36.720]   have lessened it? Definitely. Could he have led to have it have a less stupid direction of the
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.520]   war, right? One of my biggest beliefs is that the entirety of Japanese military strategy across
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.600]   the world war was completely stupid. They were shooting themselves in the head. I'm going to go
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.960]   on a rant here, if that's fine with you. Yeah, please do. Okay, so basically, Japan was really,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.000]   really scared of a war with the Soviet Union, for obvious reasons. They're the largest neighbor and
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.080]   they were getting richer and richer under Lenin and Stalin. Because, you know, transformations
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.480]   from agriculture to industry has made every single country rich. Okay. The problem was,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.800]   Japan was smaller with lesser people. And obviously, they would have lesser ammunition
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.000]   and military power during a war. The Japanese war planning said, okay, we're going to plan for a war
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.040]   with the Soviet Union. Naturally, if you're going to plan for a war with the Soviet Union, you should
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.080]   plan for a war with the Soviet Union. You should not plan for a war with China or the Philippines
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:39.360]   or America or Malaya, right? But what they did in the 1930s was they said, oh, we have this and
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:46.720]   public choice problems forced them into entering China. And so, you know, the Japanese army wanted
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.680]   to be relevant. The Japanese Navy wanted to be relevant. They just kept, like, nudging, provoking
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.440]   the Chinese into attacking them. So, what the original plan was, we will use our assets in
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.760]   Manchuria to fight the Soviet Union. And we need Manchuria to protect our assets in Korea,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.680]   a sort of early 20th century version of domino theory. And then they did that.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.080]   I'm sorry, just to clear up for the audience. Manchuria is this region in China and the
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   northeast. Yeah, in the northeast of China. Yeah, it's very rich in iron and minerals and so on.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.800]   And the original plan was that they would use their resources in Manchuria for doing it. So,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.360]   why did they want to use their resources in Manchuria in general? The answer is that
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:41.200]   Japanese military planners saw this. The model they built, the government did the entire thing,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.840]   including trade policy and everything, was Imperial Germany. The problem was Imperial
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.800]   Germany lost World War I. So, they did this entire self-reflection period. Why did they
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.920]   lose World War I? The answer was Imperial Germany really never had the resources to win World War I.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.840]   They were blockaded by the British and so on. So, their answer was, we're going to get Manchuria
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.680]   and we're going to use it so that in future wars, we don't lose it. Finally, if you don't want to
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.960]   lose any future wars, a good way of not losing wars is to not get into ones you can't win.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.440]   And so, but they didn't do that. They just walked into Japan. That was mistake number one.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:25.040]   The problem with walking into China in the 1930s, I said Japan earlier, my bad. The problem with
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:31.200]   walking into China in the 1930s is that it's a war that pisses off a lot of people, right? So,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.600]   Hiroyuki Tomizawa of Modern Japan mentions it. The Americans were quite outraged by it
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:41.520]   because it was what would be called the Neutral China Principle. All colonial powers would be
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.040]   completely fair in using Chinese resources for their own industrialization. You know,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.120]   a very morally poor thing to say, but that's how morality was back then, right?
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.680]   Whatever, okay? And so, the point was, this pissed off the Americans and the British and the French
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   and that it's useful to have powerful friends, especially when your end goal is world domination,
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.720]   right? So, they did that. And then, the problem is you can't really, China doesn't have much oil,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.240]   Japan doesn't have much oil and all that oil was imported from the US. All the atrocities in China
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:26.320]   led to very bad publicity in the US, you know, American public opinion on China, especially
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.160]   because the answer, historically, for government has been, "Don't piss off the church too much."
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.640]   And Japanese government didn't know about that because, well, they were their version of the
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:44.800]   church. But the Japanese atrocities in East China led to American missionaries in China going to
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.520]   America and reporting it to the American public. The American public got very outraged by it.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.720]   So, by the 1930s, you had this sort of like mini movement among the more religious people saying,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.480]   "We should not have American resources involved in the Japanese pillage of China."
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.640]   And so, there was a lot of domestic pressure on the American end trying to stop them. Japan's
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.160]   mistake number two was pissing off the Americans, right? The problem with pissing off the Americans
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.200]   almost all the time is that almost all of Japanese oil imports came from America, right? Saudi
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.720]   Arabia wasn't a thing back then. So, all of the Japanese oil imports came from America.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:30.400]   - It's like 97% or something like that. - Yeah. In the high 90s. And it sounded like
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:38.160]   wanted to make synthetic oil, but that didn't work very well. The history of countries thinking
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.560]   they can make their own oil is kind of funny because Deng Xiaoping, almost like 30 or 40
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.560]   years after this thing, told his cabinet that China would finance its industrialization because
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.080]   it had some oil plants. And it kind of didn't work out because it takes a lot of resources
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.440]   to make oil, which China didn't have and Japan didn't have it at that point in time. Anyways,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:11.760]   that aside, you basically had mistake number two was pissing off the US. And so, Hito Hito,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:18.240]   to what extent was the emperor responsible for this? Here's where I will put my structural hat
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.760]   on and tell you that Hito Hito was not prepared to deal with these challenges. The first thing was,
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.600]   no country had ever dealt with total war before in East Asia, right? Wars used to happen in East
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.160]   Asia, obviously, but they were sort of like the European wars before World War I. You send a few
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.520]   people to fight and when you fight them, you can lose. Well, it sucks, but you never mobilize your
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:46.560]   entire economy. The very new type of war, which Hito Hito didn't know of, you could model it, but
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:53.200]   the guy wasn't kind of smart. He wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. He really wasn't
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:59.760]   prepared to model this sort of war. Wasn't the Taiping Rebellion one of the deadliest
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.720]   things in history or something like that? It's like a civil war, but...
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:09.200]   It's a civil war, but the difference between a conventional war and a civil war is that in a
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.720]   conventional war, the Taiping Rebellion didn't have much organization. It was just people going
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.040]   and killing each other. There was no ammunitions factory that said, "This month, we're going to
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.160]   make X thousand guns because our soldiers need to fight it." Compare that to World War II.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:32.000]   You had a bunch of lots of economic planning in the U.S. Very successfully managed to say,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.560]   "We have to make these many guns and these many bombs to fight the German and Japanese," right?
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:43.360]   But that sort of thing was very underdeveloped. A very different side, a big problem with having
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:49.840]   your... In not having high-level manufacturing like America had with automobiles is that you
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:56.800]   don't... In wartime, what is useful is being able to coordinate large amounts of resources
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.520]   to their desired purpose. People make the joke that Amazon and Walmart essentially planned
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.720]   economies. It's sort of an awful joke because in World War II, when the U.S. needed central
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.880]   planning, it didn't go to the Department of Commerce. It went to Ford and GM and said,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.480]   "We have a five times bigger version of UN. We need your managers to run this because you're
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.120]   the only people who know how to." But Japan didn't have that sort of experience. The Japanese
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.360]   planning board, it talks about the biggest problem, supplies didn't come. Is he responsible
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:38.800]   for this? In the end, the MPL is responsible, but also because the guy couldn't do it. He didn't
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:45.680]   have the tools to do it. And the reasons for that are much deeper than Hirohito himself.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.400]   It's that if you read through the first part of the book, Hirohito didn't have much of an education
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.120]   in economics or science or... I mean, science to a small extent because it was considered a noble
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:05.200]   subject on engineering. If you ask him a question, the answer to which I learned in 7th grade,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   "How do you expect Ireland?" He probably wouldn't know it. He wouldn't be able to think to model
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:17.440]   through those things. The problem was no economy was prepared for a total war because they'd never
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.000]   done it before. But Japan was the first country to say, "Yeah, let's do it." And they paid the
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:31.280]   price for it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you're bringing up America. So we picked this book before the
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.560]   Ukraine thing happened, but people have been making this analogy, so we might as well talk
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:41.680]   about it. So as you know that people are making this analogy between Ukraine today and what was
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:49.760]   happening with China and Japan before World War II. So the idea is that what happened with Japan
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.080]   was they invaded China. They did all these atrocities. They invaded different parts of
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:34:01.200]   Indochina. And this was South America. So America embargoed iron, steel, copper, and most importantly,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.600]   oil exports to Japan. They froze their assets in the US, which basically prevented them from buying
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.200]   oil. And the Japanese war machine required oil. So then basically, Japan decided, "We're going
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.640]   to have to invade other parts of Indochina to get this oil. But to do that, we're going to need to
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.240]   invade America's sphere of influence, places like the Philippines. And to do that, we're probably
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.840]   going to first need to disable America's ability to wage war in the Pacific. And to do that,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.800]   we're going to have to bomb Pearl Harbor." So the analogy goes that what we're doing with
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:41.040]   Russia is similar in the sense that just as Japan invaded China and the US responded back then,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.840]   Russia has invaded Ukraine, and we're responding very strongly with sanctions now.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.480]   And maybe Russia feels like it's going to become backed up in a corner. And therefore, it decides
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.960]   to launch a conventional attack against, I don't know, NATO headquarters in Europe or something.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:01.280]   And from there, you have an all-out war. So what do you think of this analogy? Do you think it's
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.560]   valid or applicable? Yeah. They'd be very stupid to do that. But historically, Putin's actions have
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.000]   been more stupider. So you can't model it to your national actor model.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.920]   To what extent does the analogy apply? To a much less extent. Actually, it does apply,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:28.640]   but in a different way. Russia is dependent on the Western world, not in terms of oil. They have a
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:35.040]   lot better at it themselves. But in terms of things like dentist shops, Russia has shut down because
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.840]   the clowns and bitches and the sort of stuff you need to do to make fillings are made in Germany
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:45.600]   and the US. They really depend on these sort of highly specialized, small-scale things. And
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:52.880]   you can't find that outside the West. So yeah. Are they going to have another war? Are they
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.560]   going to escalate it? The base rate, say, is very low. We're going to go slightly higher than the
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.080]   base rate, but very low with small possibility. So does the analogy apply? Probably not.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   Japan was a militant country in the sense that you don't see the level of elite capture you had
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:21.360]   in Japan today in Russia, right? It just didn't exist back then, exist as it is now. So that's
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:28.560]   your first problem. The second problem is Russia wants Ukraine and it knows through historical
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:35.760]   experience, right? Putin was your KGB left-hand colonel. He knows that what are the costs of a
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:43.600]   protracted level of military tension with the US. And it's very, very obvious to anyone watching
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:50.240]   here right now that if the EU decides to rearm and the US continues, just continues its current
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:57.200]   level of armament. I'm not predicting a level of armament towards the 1980s, right? They will
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:04.800]   overpower Russia in every single margin. So will they do that? I don't think so. I think the main
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.240]   objective right now for Western policy makers should be get Putin to save face and back out
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:16.160]   without pushing him into a corner. Are they going to push him into a corner? I don't think so. It
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:24.240]   can be very bad for people living in Russia now, but so far he's not as stupid as to go and invade
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.520]   Poland or Estonia or literally go to the Netherlands and kill the NATO Secretary General.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:36.800]   That would suck a lot because it's World War III. I'm stuck in Singapore. I'm halfway between the
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:43.920]   East and the West. It sucks for me. But I doubt the analogy applies because they're not captured
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:50.800]   enough by the military for the rest of the government to care. Yeah. As far as the stupidity
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.600]   goes, you could continue the metaphor by saying that it was very stupid of Japan. People were
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.280]   saying this back then. I think Hirohito said it himself, which was like, "Listen, the US has a
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.360]   much higher GDP per capita. It even has a higher population." So the idea that we're going to be
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.680]   able to win a war against them, it's very stupid. Even if you plan out everything, we're going to
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.040]   have this offensive that in a few months, we're going to capture all these islands in the Pacific
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:25.360]   and we're going to destroy their Pacific fleet. Even then, it was such a daring scheme. I don't
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:31.680]   know what it would have taken for the whole scheme to work. I don't know. I don't think
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:38.640]   we should underestimate the stupidity of nation states. I was doing some work on this last week.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:49.520]   Allied GDP was almost always greater than Axis GDP for the entire of the war, not counting
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:56.560]   colonies of either. And for the majority of the war, the Allies had a GDP twice that of the Axis
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:06.000]   powers. So they were very stupid. What's a good analogy here? It would be like Denmark going to
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.960]   war with the UK. Maybe you'll capture a bit of Scotland, but once the UK starts rearming,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:21.760]   there's no way you can quit. I was looking at the same numbers earlier today, or not the same, but
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:29.600]   those kinds of numbers. At the time, in 1935, Japan had a GDP per capita that was almost a
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:36.000]   10th of the U.S.'s. I was thinking about this in the future. It wasn't a 10th, actually. I'm not
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.880]   sure where you got the numbers from, but I have a book I opened called The Economic World War II.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:48.480]   It's around 40%. The U.S. was 5,800-something. Japan was 2,700-something. That sounds way more
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.000]   reasonable. That makes sense. But it also had a bigger population, right? So it's a bigger total.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Yeah, yeah. It's a GDP advantage here. Yeah, yeah. So I was thinking about this
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.280]   with the potential that in the future, if there's a conflict between the U.S. and China.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.920]   The analogy is we have a bigger current military. We spend way more on the military now than China
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:16.160]   does. But if it has a higher industrial capacity, if it has a higher GDP, maybe in a year or a
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   couple of months of conflict, all this stuff you have so far is kind of useless. It doesn't matter
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:28.400]   as much as your capacity as the U.S. had during the World War II. It just produced more stuff.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:35.040]   Yeah, no. I agree. So to what extent would that, I think, the first thing is that in a short-term
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:40.400]   conflict, you would have the U.S. outmatch China in every single thing, right? Not because of the
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:49.680]   U.S., but it's U.S. plus EU. And the thing is, if you told somebody in 1922 that 100 years later,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:56.160]   the EU, what we call Europe today, is disarmed, they would laugh at you. It's historically not
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:03.360]   the norm for European countries to not spend illogical amounts of their economy on defense,
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:11.680]   right? Because they fight a lot. And now they're fighting a lot again. It's a conflict-prone
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:19.600]   continent. So basically, I find that very, like, the moment you attack the U.S., you are also
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.840]   more or less attacking, with or without NATO, a lot of countries dependent on the U.S.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.960]   So a lot of those countries, so in a short-term conflict, you would obviously be depending on
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:37.520]   only American defense because the only power ready to wage war in like 15 minutes time.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:45.840]   But in a 15-month span, no other grouping of countries can match what the U.S. has now,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.720]   just because the U.S. is technologically superior. So maybe in the time span of like
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.320]   six months to 12 months, you would see a lot of Chinese advances. But in the time span of
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:04.240]   12 months plus, it would be very quick for the U.S. to rearm. And the U.S. doesn't have a sense
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:11.440]   of complacency about the wars. All the wars, they fought in the Middle East, very far away, right?
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:17.840]   So the moment it starts hitting you, the moment you have bombs flying on their head, you're like,
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:25.520]   it becomes a lot more real to people. So there's no question that you would have a similar scenario.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:37.040]   U.S. plus EU GDP is like 31 trillion, and China plus Russia is like 40 trillion, maybe? I don't
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:44.080]   know. I'm just ballparking numbers here. But China plus Russia GDP is like maybe 30 trillion. I can
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.720]   guarantee you this 40 trillion is a lot more productive than this 30 trillion, because a lot
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:55.360]   of it is just, for all the chaos that the American economy goes through, the chaos makes it more
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:02.000]   productive. So you're going to have a lot less ghost cities and a lot less corruption on this
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.320]   end of the new Cold War. Yeah, I guess one concern is, I don't know how true this is, I just heard
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.880]   from the Zeitgeist is the idea that we don't have the industrial capacity that we used to, so the
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:18.080]   GDP is higher, but it's the industrial capacity we've shipped elsewhere. I don't know how true
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   that is. I think that industrial capacity is overrated, please. It's 2022. First thing being,
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:31.120]   a lot of initial war is going to be very high-tech. You've got to have underwater drones.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:39.600]   What is an underwater drone? It's exactly what it sounds like. It's an autonomous vehicle that's
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:46.240]   underwater. It's like you take a drone that can swim. It's exactly what it sounds like. You have
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:54.480]   a drone, and then you have a lot of satellites targeted for you, and then you bomb them using
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:01.040]   the satellite imagery. Initially in the war, human intelligence is going to be very important.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:09.920]   There have been some pretty embarrassing parts for the US on this. In 2015, there was a Chinese
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:19.600]   hack of the DHS employee database. It was very embarrassing because a lot of CIA assets in China
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:26.560]   mysteriously disappeared in the years after that, so it sucks. I also think that the industrial
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:32.000]   capacity argument goes like this. America's outsourced manufacturing to China. If you have
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.400]   a war with China, they're not going to sell it to us, and they won't be able to do it.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:42.720]   My answer is, it's sort of like the story where there are two guys running, and there's a plan,
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:49.680]   and only one guy has to outrun the other. The first thing is, the nice part of being the largest
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:55.760]   consumer for your largest trading partner is, if you cut your taps off, it will hurt you a little.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.840]   It's going to hurt them a lot. They're going to get the resources to start to re-industrialize
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:10.160]   again. The Chinese state-run economy is not known for its efficiency. The second thing is,
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.600]   if we need to, if the West needs to, they can absolutely always re-order very, very quickly.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:23.920]   It will be painful. Your software engineers who spend maybe 40% of their time working
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:31.680]   will be forced to work in some stupid factory that makes javelins, but regardless of the
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:39.600]   annoyance of it, it will happen. Finally, Dan Wang has the best critique of this. He says that
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:46.000]   cut apps don't win wars, and he's right about it. Some conductors win wars, and the US has the nice
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.680]   advantage of being the only and largest ally of Taiwan. The thing with the US is,
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:46:00.160]   a lot of its economic potential is put into stock by stupid regulations, zoning, nuclear
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:06.960]   regulations. There's a whole Twitter universe dedicated to exposing them. I'm not going to
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:15.440]   spend time on those. The thing is, once you have Bob's dropping across London, it'll be very
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:22.640]   obvious that these things have to go. These sort of things are a luxury belief for vested countries.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.960]   They can believe in it because, yes, sucks these guys couldn't get a house in New York,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.720]   but it's not materially harming us in a way that it's obvious to us now. I want it to start
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:39.760]   becoming obvious. No elected leader is going to listen to the people who are currently harming
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.840]   American or British or German industrial capacity. They're going to say, "Sucks about the
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:53.040]   pollution, but we've got a war to win." It's going to rearm very, very quick. One of the reasons I'm
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:58.320]   very optimistic about the future is that we have a lot of spare capacity left like this because of
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:08.480]   stupid rules. Once we start removing those stupid rules, it's just like a takeoff. I'm being
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:14.080]   animated because it is going to be very animated like that. People fundamentally underrate the
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:22.800]   benefit of a liberal-ish democracy, which you can change very quick and not blow up while doing it.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.440]   A good historical example is that America had a lot of mess-ups early in World War II.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:35.200]   During the Phoney War, the Phoney War was this sort of like lull in the 1930s. I'm a '40s kind
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.960]   of member in Europe. There was a lot of fighting, but it was like a stalemate. This was called the
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:48.720]   Phoney War for that reason. The Congress didn't want America to get involved in it because there
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.120]   were isolationists, and there's good reasons, and FDR wanted to. Once it became clear that American
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:01.200]   interests in Britain were going to be harmed by it, even the most isolationist Congress members
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:06.640]   changed their mind because of overwhelming public support. It is going to happen. The thing is,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:14.080]   they're right to assume that the U.S. doesn't have industrial capacity,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.280]   but they're wrong to assume that it will never have industrial capacity.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.600]   Yeah. I hope you're right. I hope you're right.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.080]   I know I'm right. That's okay. I know I'm right. That's okay.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:38.160]   So you brought up earlier that we look at the failures of American military and Western
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.120]   military in the Middle East, but we weren't as seriously invested because it didn't directly
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:50.720]   threaten us. Speaking of the Middle East, our occupation in Japan was a country with
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:49:06.240]   100 million people. It had a very serious and supremely convinced public that was supremely
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:15.600]   hardcore about the ideology of the imperial way and stuff like that. This public, it didn't take
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:24.000]   that much at all for the Western occupation to be able to put in a liberal democratic constitution
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.400]   and basically just turn around the entire trajectory of the country, whereas we look
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:35.360]   at countries that are way weaker. Afghanistan has one thousandth of the GDP of America or
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:41.920]   something like that, and we can't occupy it. What was it about Japan or about our military at the
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:47.680]   time that made it such a successful occupation? You could say, of course, one major factor is
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:53.120]   that we had Hirohito with somebody they viewed almost as a deity. We had him basically
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:50:00.160]   surrendering and cooperating, and that counts for a lot. It also explains why he wasn't tried
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   as a war criminal afterwards. Is there anything else? Why was the occupation in Japan so successful?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.280]   I thought a lot about this. There's a great book on this called Embracing Defeat,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.200]   which you should read because it's about the exact thing. It's what Japan after World War II
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.400]   and how the Americans did. Why was Japan a lot more successful than Afghanistan? The first thing
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:30.720]   is, stability is sort of like Lindy. Once you have stability under the imperial government,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.920]   they just change the people at the top. You can't really compare it to Afghanistan because there was
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:42.400]   chaos before, chaos after. You aren't solving the root problems of chaos. You have ethnic tensions.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.680]   In Japan, the thing was, there was a lot of stability. People were really tired after war.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:57.440]   After when Hirohito had his surrender address, a concern among the imperial household was that
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:08.880]   there would be protests outside the palace. In their view, that was the optimal end. People
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.520]   would be angry with them that they were at the end of the war. The thing was, there were no protests.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:23.040]   A few people were happy because the war ended. A few people were sad that they lost. The Japanese
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:30.320]   public in general had a very, very difficult war. Fun fact, Japanese GDP per capita in 1937
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.640]   was only achieved back again in 1952. You can imagine how bad the Japanese public had it.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.280]   In some sense, they were much happier under the Americans. It's a fun fact. It's an interesting
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:52.160]   fact. When the war was ending, there was large-scale looting of Japanese military supplies
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.920]   because they knew food would be scarce for the next few months or so. You had army colonels and
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:04.160]   majors just stealing food. It was completely lawless for a few months until the American
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:11.440]   military police came and sort of calmed things down. The American army in Japan was successful
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.360]   because even the Japanese government was like, "Yeah, we're going to get done with this. We're
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:21.200]   going to get back to making Japan great again." That was the most important thing.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:30.000]   Also very interesting, not fun, but interesting, McCarthy spoke to the Japanese. I don't think he
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.760]   addressed the Japanese public ever. That's very rare if you're an occupying force. They worked
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.240]   through the mechanisms of the previous Japanese government. Also interesting,
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:47.360]   a lot of Japanese... I think I made this joke on Twitter a while ago. I have a Japanese political
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:54.880]   family. Our grandfather was a war criminal, not executed because Hirohito asked McCarthy not to.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:53:04.160]   Father was a finance minister in the '80s. Current kid is number five in the LDP leadership
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:11.120]   election. The answer is the elite of Japan was not changed after the war. It made it really easy,
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:19.680]   made it really convenient to continue. They had this mass hallucination that, "Oh, no, I'm blanking
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:27.520]   on the guys." Toji made us do it, and the army made us do it. It just continued with the old
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:38.400]   elite again. It didn't change much. It is also very interesting that elites don't change after
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:46.240]   revolution. It is not a well-appreciated fact. This is great paper. Let me find it. It basically
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:51.280]   shows that the Chinese elite in the 1980s, when the country reformed, was the same as the Chinese
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.760]   elite in the 1920s, when the country was having economic growth. The same thing with Japan. In
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   the 1960s and '70s, the same family connections made them powerful again. The next thing is that
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:12.000]   America didn't really change. Another really big part of Japan, Japan was occupied. Its formal
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:19.360]   structures were changed. You would be a little crazy to call it a democracy until 1990 or
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:25.440]   something. Bernhard has this great post about East Asian industrialization. I think it's a medium.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.480]   It's quite popular. One part of it was the Ministry of Industry and MIT. I forgot their
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:39.680]   full form. Their policies were basically rubber-stamped by the lower house of the
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:46.800]   DS. There wasn't much difference between those guys and the Soviets up north.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:52.560]   So yeah, Japan was a democracy, but it was a democracy. It didn't change much.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:55:02.400]   The fact that the elite, to begin with, was, I guess, open to Western ideas raises the question
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:09.440]   of where this elite was during the 1930s and the 1940s. Many of them were suppressed. The first
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.520]   Japanese prime minister after World War II, I'm blanking on his name again, but he was a left-wing
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:20.720]   leader. He's basically one of those, "We shouldn't have war." The Japanese equivalent of the girl
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.760]   offering the flower to the American police guy during the Vietnam War. Those guys were
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:34.160]   obviously suppressed because it was inconvenient for them. Also very interesting, the Japanese
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:42.880]   Communist Party welcomed the American occupation. So they were seen as the anti-teachers of this.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.040]   But Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which is referred to, for those who don't know,
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:56.000]   it says that Japan conned the army. It says that the Japanese state gives up war as a means of
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:06.480]   policy. So that basically gives the new elite a good excuse to stop fighting, to stop with that.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:12.400]   But the problem is, where were those people? The ideology is fake. It's just what helped them to
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:18.320]   get them into power. So now it's if fascism helped them get into power, I guarantee you Hideki
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:29.680]   Toji would have become Mother Teresa. I don't think many of them really believed in what they
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:35.040]   did, given that they all switched six months later, after 1945. It's very hard to make the
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:40.640]   case they were ideologues. They were just opportunists. Yeah. I'm not sure about that.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:49.120]   I mean, maybe this is specific to those elites. But if you look at the actual soldier class,
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:55.120]   there you cannot question that you had ridiculous levels of devotion.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:02.960]   That's true. That's true. But the soldier class was sort of selected out of the Japanese elite.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:09.200]   Yeah. I was just thinking about this earlier, which was that, one of the ways you can explain
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:15.600]   this, where does all this nationalistic fervor go, is that it died in the Pacific, right? All
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.360]   those nationalistic people were sent out to the front lines and they were just massacred,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:24.000]   in some cases, literally by their own superiors. There's so many examples where
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:33.360]   the Japanese generals just send out their useless charges, like direct charges,
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.480]   like suicide missions, basically. I'm not talking about Kamikaze. I'm talking about
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:45.600]   being in charges. They're going to bow down. The defense of Okinawa was a great example of that.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:51.280]   More people died in that than the atom bombings. It was 150,000 in Okinawa.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.880]   Yeah, 150,000 people. That's almost half the population of Okinawa.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.000]   Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was very, very brutal.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:05.920]   There's a great quote that... What was his name? You know one of those famous... One of those
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:11.440]   legends that he was the guy in one of these Pacific islands, a Japanese soldier, and he
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.000]   didn't realize that Japan had surrendered. It was decades later and he's still feeling like random
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.200]   civilians because he doesn't know that Japan has surrendered. They dropped down leaflets and
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.000]   then newspapers to show him that, "Oh, Japan today, this is what it looks like. We've surrendered."
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.120]   He still wouldn't believe it. Eventually, they got him back to Japan. Later on,
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:35.680]   he wrote a book about it. He's like, "The reason I didn't believe Japan could have surrendered
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.920]   is that the motto at the time was that 100 million souls will die for the empire.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:47.280]   Japan could not have lost the war because if Japan had lost the war,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.120]   there would be no Japan, right? Yeah, there would be no Japanese left.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:59.840]   Why do you think the elites were cynical? Do you think the elites are generally more cynical when
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:04.720]   it comes to ideology than the average person? Yeah. It's all self-selects for that because
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.040]   to get the top, you've got to lie and you've got to move it out and you've got to be within the
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:19.280]   things of the day. That's pretty much the main point, which is that the elites knew that they
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.680]   couldn't re-militarize again. It's kind of pointless to re-militarize again to fight who,
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:31.360]   and so they just basically decided not to do it. The last 10 minutes is more or less speculation
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:36.080]   from my part because I have not read into the elite mechanics of Japan before and after World
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:43.440]   War II into a good level of detail. Right. My kind of prior on elites is not that they're not
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.520]   ideological. I do agree that often their ideology is cynical, but if you look at elites in America,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:55.440]   for example, I think many of them are genuinely very, well, put in all the stuff you can put in
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:59.600]   the bucket of left-wing, right? They genuinely believe those things, right? In ways that are
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:06.480]   even kind of productive to them. No, but it never gets past, right? Even they don't pass it. There's
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.680]   probably one senator who believes that you should nationalize the oil companies, but they never
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:19.920]   introduce it onto it. They never make the arguments for it. There are people who are
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:27.760]   ideologically left-wing. They'll just never stay elected for too long. The thing is the competitive
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.880]   nature, I mean, to what extent it's competitive, of American democracy forces you to temper your
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:40.560]   views. The only way to get ahead is to do what the public would only define once.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:49.040]   Yeah. Okay. So to bring it back to Hirohito, one thing that I found very interesting,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:56.080]   very confusing is how this guy got so much fucking adoration because physically he was
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.280]   not so imposing. Interpersonally, he was not that charismatic from what it seems. He just
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:08.000]   wasn't that communicative. He wasn't like his grandfather, Meiji. There's actually a funny
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.440]   picture of him on the internet where you can see him next to MacArthur, the general that was in
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:20.160]   charge of occupying Japan after the war. MacArthur is like two feet taller than him. He looks like a
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:28.320]   midget in comparison to MacArthur. I don't understand how are all these super right-wing
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.680]   militaristic guys, the entire nation really, they're willing to die for the empire.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:41.200]   One of the things that really made him not like Hirohito was when the book is talking about how
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:47.360]   these Japanese soldiers, the last few years of the war, they knew that Japan was going to lose.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.320]   The reason that these Japanese soldiers are dying is so that the idea is instead of an
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:03.280]   unconditional surrender, we'll try to show the West that we can basically sustain this kind of
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.680]   war for a long time, even if we're going to lose. If we want to avoid this, we won't do
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:15.040]   an unconditional surrender. One of the purposes of that was to make sure that in the conditional
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:20.240]   surrender that Hirohito is not tried as a war criminal. That's one of the things that these
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.480]   millions of, what was it, more than a 1.5 million, no, 3 million Japanese died, but 1.5 million of
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:32.720]   Japanese died in the last year of the war. A lot of them died so that the emperor wouldn't be tried
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.360]   as a war criminal. The idea that he could have stopped the war earlier, or at least potentially
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.600]   could have stopped the war earlier, and he didn't, and these people are just dying for him in his
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:51.760]   name. People aren't dying in his name. There's this great, I don't know, you should read the
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:03:04.560]   other book, which is Japan Prepares for Total War. The thing is, nobody thought the emperor was God,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.960]   thought he was God-like, but it sounded like he was, it's easier to imagine for Hindus, I guess,
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:18.240]   he was a God-like figure. He's not God, and they saw him as their model leader. The first thing
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.560]   that they were dying, they went into war because the army paid a lot of money, it was a lot better
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:28.160]   than being in declining Japanese firms at the time, commodity prices were pretty low, so they
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   didn't have much of a thing. They didn't have much of things to do otherwise. Also interesting,
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:42.560]   the first public health system in Japan was encouraged by the military because they would
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:49.040]   saw all their conscripts being so undernourished and ill that they're like, oh, we can't solve this
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:56.560]   on a military level, we have to have a systemic response to this. The second thing is really that
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:03.840]   why did they die for the emperor? A lot of them believed it, and so they died for it. Why did
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:11.200]   they believe it for such an unconvincing persona? Because he was not a politician, his stature
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:20.880]   derived from the fact that he was the descendant of the gods. It's not a charisma thing. In
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.760]   authoritarian systems, people don't derive their power from the consent of the governed,
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.440]   they derive it from something else. In this case, something else was,
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.320]   "I'm the descendant of the sun goddess."
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.440]   Yeah. Doesn't that contradict what you said earlier where you said the emperors didn't
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:49.120]   believe that he was a literal deity? Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. There's a god-like
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.160]   figure and there's a god. The sun goddess, her name starts with A, I forgot it. She's the god,
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:04.320]   but he's a god-like figure. I understand that. It feels like semantics to me.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:13.040]   It wouldn't be semantics. If it was semantics, they shouldn't have been happy about the surrender.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:22.960]   Many of them weren't, right? No, but a large portion of the Japanese
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:31.200]   public was just, "Meh, okay, fine, move on now." Let me put you in very economic terms.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:38.160]   There's a reservation prize they have for a god and there's a reservation prize they have
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.880]   for a god-like figure. For the god-like figure, the reservation prize was pretty low. It was two
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:52.640]   years of starvation. For a god, two years? They weren't prepared to fight the Americans for very
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:06:00.560]   long. If he was a real god figure, they would have been prepared to fight the Americans and
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:07.600]   British for much longer. I guess my original point is that because they believed him to be
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:14.880]   a god-like figure, they made many sacrifices for him as an individual person, separate and apart
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:20.160]   from the sacrifices they made for Japan as a nation. But he was inseparable from Japan as
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.440]   the nation, right? Right, which is another thing you can critique though, right?
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, too.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:37.760]   To make it clear though, they were prepared to make the initial sacrifices. First, it was
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:44.240]   convenient for them to make it. The Japanese economy was really, really bad across the '30s.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.400]   The second thing was, it was sort of like a, how do I put it? It was sort of like a,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.160]   not signaling, but like quasi-signaling. I'm going to fight for the emperor. But when the
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.240]   fighting got bad, it was like, "Ah, wait, the emperor's not worth that much. It's okay."
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:08.800]   All right. Let's continue talking about what happened after the war. You probably know much
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.640]   more about the post-war economy in Japan than I do. I actually know close to nothing about it,
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:19.680]   except for, there is, Manfred Olsen very famously explained why Japan and Germany had
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.480]   growth rates that were so high after the war and were able to catch up relatively fast.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:32.400]   Bringing back public choice theory, his claim was all these factions that accumulate in democracies
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:39.520]   were abolished in the war. They basically got a fresh start without all this accumulated crutch.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.920]   Because of that, they had extremely high growth rates. As you know, in the 1980s,
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.920]   there were fears Japan's economy would overtake America's. In fact, if they didn't have a
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:56.000]   population collapse, who knows what would have happened. More or less correct. All the
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:02.480]   interest groups were destroyed. Actually, all the interest groups were destroyed. It was replaced
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.320]   with better ones. The interest groups are bad, but there are good interest groups and bad interest
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:13.440]   groups. It's sort of like the new interest groups in Japan were the bureaucrats who ran the trade
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.960]   industry. I know a little about it, it's not too much, but there are a few big things here, right?
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:25.200]   One of the problems the Americans saw in Japan was that, well, the biggest interest group was
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:31.600]   these zaibatsu, the Japanese conglomerates that, like the war, because it gave demand for their
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:38.000]   goods, they tried to break them up. And here's where the intersection between that and the
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.320]   new Japanese industrial policy comes. The Americans put a sort of like an FTC thing where they said,
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.160]   you know, you're going to get too big, otherwise this commissioner is going to sue you in court,
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.600]   and the court is going to be independent, and the prime minister can't drive the judge,
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.880]   and whatever. The thing is, the Japanese kept the form of this anitrust law, but just made
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   enough loopholes in it for it to be like, yeah, we have anitrust law, and we have a trade commissioner,
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.120]   but nobody enforces it because it's convenient not to. And then, so the Japanese economy changed,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:17.360]   they sort of used these previous zaibatsu, they reformed themselves into kiritsus, which is,
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:23.840]   you know, probably just a more financialized version of a zaibatsu. And then they, so for
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.160]   those of you who don't know, a zaibatsu was just this huge conglomerate that emerged in Japan
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:37.280]   over the 1900s that was one of the biggest, it was one of the entities that benefited the most
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.160]   from the war, because they were mining and industrial, wars require a lot of mining and
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:48.000]   industry, so they made a lot of money. And the Americans tried to break up the zaibatsu, but
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.040]   almost all the zaibatsu still exist today in the form of kiritsus, and the kiritsu guys get really
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.920]   mad when you ask them about it, because they don't want to be associated with the rape of Nanking,
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   they want to be associated with nice Toyota cars. So that's the thing, that the Japanese post-war
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:11.840]   economy was very much influenced by the fact that the Americans were semi-incompetent at
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.520]   breaking down the zaibatsu, they just re-emerged again. Standard economic growth theory tells you
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:23.200]   when you have a lot of broken buildings, it's very easy to repair them back to where you got.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.880]   So that's where a lot of the initial growth came from.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:34.080]   But sorry, maybe you were going there anyways, but there's almost a super compensatory mechanism
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.920]   here where it's like, you damage the thing, get more benefit than you would have.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:46.080]   Yeah, that's true. Obviously, it is suboptimal. It is obviously worse than not damaging them.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.480]   But once you do damage them, it's not like Bastia's broken windows thing, right? If you
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.560]   break the windows, it increases consumption. And Bastia's like, but it increases consumption here,
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.400]   but they're going to spend the money on something else, and those guys are hard. I'm like, yeah,
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.440]   that's true. And same thing over here. I'm making the opposite point. The damage,
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.400]   counterfactually speaking, in the long term, the damage actually causes a benefit in the long term,
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.280]   because you're getting rid of these special interest groups that would have
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:26.320]   tampered growth for a long time. Yeah, probably. But I mean, yes, but also no,
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.160]   because special interest groups in Japan didn't really disappear. I mean, yes, in the sense that
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:38.640]   the bad ones went, and slightly better ones came up, which is true. But that should not be your
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:43.680]   main explanation. Because a lot of Japanese growing in the 50s, which was just catch up,
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.600]   the rebuilding, the broken buildings, and the bombed cities, and burned houses. So
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:56.080]   partly true is my Snopes fact check reading. No. And the other thing is like,
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.360]   Japanese industrial policy was very much a feature of the war. Without the war, you wouldn't have had
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:09.280]   this level of government control of the economy, which led to a higher level of, how do I put it,
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.600]   a higher level of planning. I don't think planning is the right word. It's too many connotations.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:24.480]   Basically, they got export driven growth because of this, because they had lots of social capital
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:30.240]   between the planners and the company executives. And it's really easy for them to say, okay, I'll
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.920]   give you a few billion yen. You're going to use this to sell cars in the US. But in three years,
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.360]   if your cars don't sell well enough, you're going to shut down and merge with your rival, who will
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.040]   be more successful. So that was one of the drivers of Japanese growth. That's one of the reasons why
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:54.560]   the Koretsu's and the industrial policy systems existed. So that's one of the parts of growth
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.160]   after the war. And also having played with America just makes you better off for the obvious reason
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.640]   that Americans are rich and they buy a lot of your stuff. Right. Yes. All right. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.680]   This was a very, very interesting. This is extremely interesting. And then, yeah, I'm
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.480]   really glad we did this. I hope we do this with more books because this was actually a very good
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:23.200]   way to and you happen to know a lot about the digital topics. So this is very useful. I don't
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.640]   know if you feel is there anything else we're talking about with Russia, Japan and Hirohito?
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.000]   Or no, nothing else. I'm probably hitting some edge of my knowledge in like one more question.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.680]   So let's not go there. Okay. All right. So we're done with that topic. I guess we could talk about
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:46.000]   a general thing, which is that we're kind of doing similar things, at least for the time being.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:54.000]   Yeah, you're doing it. I guess we're both doing it part time. So like, you're what's your age?
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.400]   I'm 18. I turned 18 last October. Okay. So I mean, how are you structuring your reading,
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:11.280]   writing a podcast? Oh, man. Oh, my God. Okay. So mornings in when I travel, I get a lot of my
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.320]   Twitter time done, right? Because Twitter is like my biggest source of things that go on. It's not
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:23.760]   a good source, but it's my good source. So yeah, how to structure my reading right now. I think a
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.480]   lot of my reading is I go for I go for deep dives and books. I was doing Japan. So I read Hirohito,
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.320]   I read Amazing Defeat, I read Japan, the First Total War. I read Mark Harrison's The Economics
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:42.480]   of World War Two, not a very detailed book, but a very good book in terms of the statistics it
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:49.440]   gives you, right. So I'm going to do that. And I like to have my stuff to combine the learning
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.160]   data visualization in Python, I'm going to do that with a bunch of World War Two economic numbers.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.880]   So like, I both like learn how to use the very difficult matplotlib. And you know,
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:08.400]   this and that a lot of my reading is ad hoc, I have this set of PDFs I read, which is a lot of
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.920]   time you just spend staying at my phone. So I just it's, it's second nature. A lot of my writing is
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.360]   a lot more difficult to structure because first because it requires a level of calm that I usually
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:25.120]   don't get apart from weekends. So that is much harder. And as for your question of how do I get
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.600]   my my reading, all the usual sources, the listeners of this podcast with no marginal revolution,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:39.520]   econ law, I did a lot of Rohit Krishnan, Matt Clifford, I did a lot of, I don't know,
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:49.760]   Les Law, E. A. Foleyman, and Astro Codex X. But really, a lot of my stuff comes from just going
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.240]   through the bibliographies of books I like to read. So that is where a good so luckily, don't
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:06.400]   pirate books, pirating books is bad. But yeah, it's the cheapest way for most people. So basically
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:12.640]   that. Um, what else I think being in the original thing gives me a better sense of ideas, forget
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.520]   talk to other people. My biggest source of like things I should work on is talking to people like
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:25.040]   you or other people or other things. I also have a lot of time staying at a wall doing nothing
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.160]   because of nature of my work. That gives me a lot of time to contemplate. Finally, I'm applying to
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.760]   college. So I have to, you know, figure out how to legible, how to make my achievements legible to a
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:42.640]   college admissions person. A lot of my time goes around doing that. Yeah, what are your long term
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.920]   plans? I know, what are my long term plans? I have a long time. Okay, I have a lot to ask me.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:56.800]   You're going for computer science. Probably. So my next thing is, is a compromise because it's the
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:04.080]   I want to do CS. I want to do like econ related econ plus, like quant related things. The best
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.040]   end of that in Singapore is computer science plus econ. Because the government puts a lot of money
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.000]   into computer science and it might as well add econ because it's my interest. But yeah, CS plus
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.320]   econ at NUS is what I'm aiming for. It already got accepted for CS there. I'll be applying to the UK
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:26.240]   with my, okay, let me go, let me tell you one thing. For all that I like to criticize America,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:33.680]   the British are infinitely worse. British college courses haven't changed since like 1970 something.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.160]   In America, you can pick and choose your major. In Singapore, you can get a lesser extent. But in
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:46.080]   Britain, you have the same courses since 1620, I guess. And the big problem is no course there.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.600]   I'm looking for LSE math and econ if I can get in and I find a pot of money somewhere.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.760]   Have you not already with the emergent ventures grant?
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:03.280]   College in the UK, it costs like 200,000 Singapore dollars.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.120]   I regrettably, my wallet in my pocket, I don't have 200,000 Singapore dollars.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.800]   But for American listeners, that's like 180,000 USD or something on that range.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.960]   But honestly, I would not be surprised if you were somehow able to,
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.360]   if you managed to come up with a lot of sponsorships and grants.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:29.520]   So if I was more into it, I would do macro econ and make my newsletter pay.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.880]   Even like 500 bucks a month makes my life super easy.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:46.080]   But that would be like if and when I finish my current, how do I put it? Self-imposed military
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:52.320]   time. What is the topic you're reading about now?
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:58.000]   I'm doing a bunch of, I mean, I'm not reading about it. I knew about it before. But I'm writing
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.680]   about the U.S. dollar reserve system, like a primer. I tweeted about it yesterday. It's like,
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.560]   why do countries hold U.S. dollar reserves? And the answer is they hold U.S. dollar reserves
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.560]   because central banks like to use dollars for insurance reasons. Like, wait, why do central
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.640]   banks need U.S. dollars for insurance? The answer is the U.S. dollar is the main currency used in
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.400]   trade. So it is really, really important to have it in case your currency depreciates too much or
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:31.440]   appreciates too much and you can sell it and get USD. The other reason is that the number one source
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:38.240]   of financial crises for developing countries in the last few decades has been, we need dollars
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.920]   to pay our dollar debts. We don't have enough dollars. So we're broke. And central banks keep
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:51.280]   it for that very specific insurance reason of financial crises. And next comes the question,
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.360]   well, why can't the Remini B or what's normally called the BQR replace this? The answer is nobody
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.480]   use it for trade. Nobody use it for trade because you can't use it outside China, the capital
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.920]   controls. So like, wait, till China takes out its capital controls, we can't do it? Yeah, pretty
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.480]   much. Next question comes, why can't we use Bitcoin? The answer is you would be very crazy
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.680]   to structure international trade with Bitcoin. You know, it's too volatile. Next month your price
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:23.680]   doubles and your income doubles and debt cost doubles. So it's never going to happen. And most
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:29.040]   importantly, Bitcoin is a risk asset. You can't use it as insurance. When your Nasdaq falls 10%,
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:37.680]   Bitcoin falls 25%. The US dollar falls like 1.5% or even goes up. So you can't really do that.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:45.120]   That's like my current writing. But as of 2020 at March, it's going to change as and when I find
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.240]   interesting things to write about. Now I have a question for you. What is one good thing I should
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:55.920]   be doing, but I'm not doing? I don't know what you're doing. So I'm not sure. I told you what
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.200]   I'm doing. I'm just writing about it now. Okay. That's all I'm doing. The answer to that question
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:06.880]   is probably something I should be doing as well. It sounds like you have been on the side, like
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.720]   just doing some computer science from what I've talked to you separately about. So yeah, if you're
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.040]   doing that anyways, yeah, that's fine. One thing that I haven't done enough, but when I have done
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:24.480]   it, it's been super useful. It's just that if I just randomly network with people over Twitter or
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:30.320]   something, if I just send them a Calendly link or something, you just learn, "Oh, this person
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:38.480]   is just way more connected than I thought he was. He's just super interesting." That has led
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.720]   to some really, really cool things. Super fun. Yeah. I started doing this one Zoom call a week
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.720]   with fans and weeks before I'm free, I make it to five or seven. It's very, very fun. More people
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:57.760]   should do it. It's my cheat code to life. Yeah. And what is one thing I should be doing,
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:04.480]   but I'm not doing? I think you should scale this up very much. What is your estimate of your impact
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:10.960]   via podcast versus writing? Roughly zero, both ways. By impact, do you mean the audience?
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:18.000]   Yeah. I mean, how much way do you define? Do you think your podcast gives you more impact
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.320]   on your writing? I think they're both zero impact. As far as impact doesn't, I don't know,
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:28.000]   improving the world in some way? No. I mean, impact on you. A very crude
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.760]   approximation is views. For time spent, how much I'm learning and so on, I think writing,
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.200]   probably I'm learning more than I'm doing learning podcasting. Although I think it
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.840]   depends on the guest. What did you mean when you said scale it up a way more?
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:51.520]   Okay. What would a self-sustaining lunar society podcast look like?
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:58.640]   Self-sustaining, meaning like, you could work on this full time without any outside capital.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:04.240]   I would have to be way more regular and it would have to be way more broadly appealing.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:09.680]   Yeah. That sucks. Because the only appealing stuff is almost always dumbed down. So
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.800]   like nobody can do godly appealing. So yeah, I don't know.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.440]   Just recently discussing this, like, you know, Lex Freedman's podcast.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:24.240]   Yeah. He's clearly a very smart guy. But at least in whatever his research area is,
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:30.880]   he must be right. Or at least I'm told so. But yeah, you can clearly see
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:40.480]   to reach his million subscribers or whatever. And this is not just to take copium by the spoonful.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.640]   I mean, by definition, to appeal to the majority of the population,
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.280]   you have to appeal to midwits, right? By definition, what a midwit is.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.160]   And there are exceptions to this, right? Like, for example, there's a conversation with Tyler,
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.360]   which actually does appeal to a lot of people. And it's not midwitted.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.320]   That's right. But he started off with a lot of social capital. So you can't compare that.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   No, that's true. That's true. Like, in my case, it's ended up being the case that the money you
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.960]   make, like, you make, I could like start a Patreon or something, but it would be like so
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.480]   much less money than just like random grants people offer you. Yeah, very nice of extremely,
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.040]   extremely nice of them. And I'm very grateful for it. And then they like, and that is like,
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.480]   that's orders of magnitude more than I could make if I had a Patreon. You know what I mean?
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:38.720]   Yeah, no, no, I, I agree. I think like an easier way of this is, I'm going to plug
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.920]   in my friend Krish Koopchand here, who has this very cool thing called a learning public offerings,
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:53.120]   where you tell people, I'm going to learn about this. And six months later, I will teach you
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.440]   everything you need to know about this. And I'll have Zoom call with you, I'll give you an NFT or
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.440]   whatever your preferred model is. And you basically say, you pay me enough money to cover
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.800]   some part of my expenses now. And we can, and six months later, I'll teach you everything you need
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.720]   to know. And if you're popular enough, you would probably do that. It's like open source should
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.200]   work. Like I said, it doesn't, but it's sort of like a model of how these things should work.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.800]   And another easier way is to have, it's much easier if you do on the econ, like I do it,
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.880]   but I can just have an econ news that are focusing on normie things, like where will industries go
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:36.560]   next month? And what does that mean for stocks and have a better user doing things I like to do?
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:42.320]   So very, I don't know how to put it. The other thing, like more people, my,
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   and what I mean is the application, the thing I felt most strongly about more people should do
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:53.760]   company level analysis. So I am, because one, it pays, and two, because it's underrated by
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:59.280]   econs and overrated by stock people. And I consider you're very much in more econ than
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:06.240]   stock person. So yeah, I think is very, very useful to sort of like commercialize it,
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:11.600]   dumb it down, class subsidize your intellectual pursuits by the commercial part.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:22.480]   Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The thing is, I don't think I want to do the intellectual pursuits thing as
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:32.800]   a main thing for my career. So it's not, I don't need like a lot of money. It's not like I'm,
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:39.440]   you know, I need the, I need to make the rent this month or something. So I think it would
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.080]   just make more sense for me to like, not worry that much about monetization of this kind of
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.240]   stuff. And then just make my money as a software engineer or like whatever else I decided to do.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:57.520]   Right. Yeah. So but there's a separate question about like having, because
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:04.000]   I think the much harder question is like, how do you actually be a good public intellectual,
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.200]   right? Public intellectual is like a kind of cringe word to use, but you know what I mean?
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.520]   Right. Like how do you produce content that's original and interesting, especially when you're
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.280]   young, like us, where you don't have that much life experience or just general knowledge about
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:25.520]   the world. Public intellectual is cringe, but thought leader is worse. The first thing is,
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.400]   if you do a bad job, you'll come to know pretty obviously, like every time I post my mind is bad,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.400]   it gets like low engagement. People are like, yeah, it's meh. I'm like, oh, that sucks.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:41.120]   But you come to know that, obviously. The second thing is to have a circle of competence and be
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:50.000]   graded. So you can be, I have a friend who's a friend of the guy who's, you know who's Zoltan
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.400]   Posard, do you? He's a former New York Fed guy who works at, I don't know, FedSquare or Deutsche
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:05.680]   Bank now, where he knows every single thing about Fed plumbing. So how do excess reserve get
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.520]   transported? How does the bond sales happen, etc, etc. He knows every single thing about that.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.680]   And if you want to be a good public intellectual, public, or whatever your placement for that word
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:24.000]   is, be very good at one thing and draw on your credibility from there. It's not very hard.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.520]   If you're coding, it is very easy to demonstrate your competence in something, just, you know,
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.520]   build something cool. And people are like, oh, this is really interesting, you're a super boy.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.760]   But if you are writing or speaking, it is much harder. It is obviously an open problem. But I
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:45.840]   mean, a podcast is like one way of demonstrating your graded because people whom other people
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:49.200]   respect say, oh, I like talking to you for one hour, we should do this again. I'm like, oh,
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.240]   super cool. But the other, you have to basically somehow build a proof of work and show it to
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.840]   people. My answer to that is do Econ stuff people like, and at some point of time, if possible,
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:07.840]   monetize it, which only works if your thing is commercially oriented. So I can't do a history
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:15.680]   of the gold standard. That sucks. Yeah. Yeah. And, but even like you,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:22.320]   the proof of work thing, I mean, you could say that the proof of work is like the amount of
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.000]   engagement you get, but I've noticed in like things I've gotten a lot of engagement on,
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.840]   even when it's like on a specific topic, like, for example, I have like some posts on like talent
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.880]   that got some attention, right? On like spotting talent. And I could tell you that I know less
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.840]   about spotting talent than like the median manager at a Best Buy, right? I know close to nothing
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.480]   about finding talent. And, you know, you can have blog posts that get a 10, I'm not saying that,
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.600]   like, you know, they got viral and anything, but they did get like one of them was on the
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   marginal revolution. And so like, that's another thing that kind of makes me skeptical of the value
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.680]   of being a public intellectual in the first place is that like, I actually generally don't know
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.880]   anything about practically identifying talent, but then you can get, you can like just put out
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.040]   these like sort of insight porn things and you get that good attention. And I don't know what
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:12.480]   kind of value that's generating for the world or, you know what I mean? Oh, no, I, I agree,
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   but I also joke to my friends that, that, that, that among our circle, I'm the best at evaluating
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:27.520]   talent because all of my tutor mutuals end up getting famous. So like, yeah. So like on the
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:33.280]   object level issue it doesn't matter because you're not, you know, you're not, you're not
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:40.000]   selling your officials to fish, you're selling it to fishermen, but on the, on the meta level,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:48.480]   the thing with writing about, about, about like the sort of general things is that nobody knows
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:54.560]   how to, how to do it unless you have 30 years of experience. So like, don't worry about it. If they,
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:00.880]   if they liked it, you can do it again. The second thing is people are not appreciating your object
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:07.520]   level thing on talent. That's okay. Nobody's going to make you the head of McKinsey's recruiting
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:14.640]   thing. There's a very big difference in knowing something, in doing something and being able to
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:21.840]   explain it. And you're like, it's okay. I think your personal talent or like anything you write
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:28.400]   about Barber, about the Barber strategy, the value you provide to people is not the Barber strategy.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:34.400]   It is explaining it in ways they can understand. I'm sure, I'm sure they knew it, right? Everyone
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.000]   has the idea that like this month I'm going to be super fit and next six months I'm going to do
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.680]   nothing. I mean, everybody has that, those things, but the point is giving me some sort of form and
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:49.040]   structure. Yeah. You know, it's kind of funny on that post particular because it was, it was just
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:53.920]   like hanging out in my Google drive. I think I'd written this like a few weeks or months ago. It
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:58.720]   was just like, almost like a throwaway thing where it was like, these things could seem kind of like
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.360]   Barber strategies. And then, and then it was compared to like other bad posts where I've like
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.800]   put in way more effort. It was just, it was literally just kind of a throwaway. Right. But
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:15.680]   then, but then Alexey, he says something very nice about my blog, but he, but he used that blog post
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:19.600]   as like the thing to retweet, to like, say the nice thing about the blog. And so now this, this
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.080]   like random blog post has like 150 likes or something. And it was just like a throwaway
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.600]   thing. Right. Like a little bit. And these other ones are, I like spend a lot more effort on there,
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:33.360]   like five likes, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I applied to finish studies at a,
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.200]   you know, the blogger, by the way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He had a similar point where he's
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.360]   like talking about, he just goes through like how many subscribers he has a graph. And he's like,
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.800]   you see these big jumps. They're not like posts. I spent a lot of effort on or something. They're
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:52.000]   just posts that happened to get featured on MR. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. You like my other like,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.760]   I shouldn't be worrying too much about distribution. I mean, the question is, if you like one part of
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:03.360]   me is like, Oh, maybe I could I because what every single time I need financial news, I'm like, no,
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:09.600]   I could improve on this. I could, I could do a five x better job at explaining this. Because
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.680]   I know a lot of financial journalists and they're like, yeah, the, the job requires me to dumb
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:18.320]   things down. I'm like, no, you could have an intelligent one. I'm like, yeah. So every time
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:23.600]   I see these sort of things, I realize that you have a pretty clear trade off between writing.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:31.680]   I put it in a different way. When you grow on the internet, your audience shapes you as much as you
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:37.200]   shape them. It is important not to write too many stupid things that go viral, because you will be
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:43.120]   incentivized to write stupid things that go viral. You have to play that that better game of not
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.680]   writing stupid viral things. And so I refuse sometimes to write about popular things,
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:55.040]   because I don't want to, I don't want it to go viral. It is a liability rather than an asset,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:01.200]   because it's going to be stupid. And I'm going to be known as the guy who did this, which is like,
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.480]   people say I'm a long bug. They say, any attention is good attention or something like that. But I'm
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.040]   like, no, you've got to be known for the right thing. So I don't know how to deal with that.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.520]   I deal with it with not with forcing myself and not put stupid things that go viral.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.200]   I think your bio study post wasn't stupid things that went viral. But I know that you know that
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:24.240]   you can write stupid things that go viral. Don't do it. I've done it myself.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:32.480]   Yeah, I didn't go viral exactly. But they were stupid. They ended up being a little more popular
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.920]   than my most awful things. Yeah. So what is your long term plan as far as like the intellectual
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.640]   stuff goes? Like, are you planning on keeping up the blog and podcast?
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:46.560]   I am. Yes, yes, yes. At least for the next two years, at least till August 2023. I will keep
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:52.640]   doing this. And then it's like, I'll be in college then. It depends on the amount of free time I have
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.000]   it. I'll probably keep it because it's my only way of socializing with people. So yeah, it better stay.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:08.320]   Yeah, yeah. You have like, a surprising amount of leeway in like, I guess, in my experience,
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:14.160]   and like, at least us college is just like, if you want to spend like, 60 hours a week on your
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.560]   college work, you can if you want to spend 20 hours, you can. And the difference is not going
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:24.400]   to be or maybe, maybe there's maybe a smaller gradient, but there's ways to compress the amount
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.640]   of time you have to spend in college, you can work on the other stuff.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.760]   Yeah, that's true. I don't know. I want to go to the UK for the fact that one,
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:38.560]   you have pretty short terms, you have a lot more free time. And two, I find it very humiliating to
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:46.000]   describe my entire life story to get into college. I'm sorry, please just ask me why do math and let
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:53.600]   me in. Right. They're asking you to be cynical. And when they asked us like, you know, vague
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.920]   questions about like, Oh, yeah, tell us about what led you to this point in life, where you're
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:03.440]   applying here? And why? What is your life story? The honest answer is you have a lot of you have
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:08.720]   a strong credential, and I want that strong credential, right? Yeah, I like my eyes. So
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:15.680]   you're like, Yeah, I know. Yeah. That says, I like money, and you're my nicest boss. You're
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.720]   probably getting that. And nobody likes that. And, and so I don't like the selection effect
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:27.040]   of selecting for people who can lie. Well, it's not gonna end up well. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So,
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.800]   no, like, on a on a model level, I, I refuse to to engage it. Well, did you not apply? Like,
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:39.760]   what did you do for those kinds of questions? I'm going to apply this September. So yeah.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.560]   But also, like, I optimize my life in high school for doing things. I like I was a guy who was in
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:53.200]   lunch and sitting in a corner with six books. And I read six books a week. So I wish I'd done that.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.760]   Because like, in middle school, like my mom was convinced I needed to become an Eagle Scout or
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.800]   like come up with out in order to like, yeah, I know. I'm like, I pretty much fed off all those
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.680]   kids. They're like, No, I can't play a double. I can't play the piano. I probably want to say,
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.800]   please, no, no, no. Just being incompetent at anything else is a good advantage. Give me your
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:19.440]   time. Right? Yeah. Because I, I like what you ended up doing in high school, I ended up doing
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.240]   in college, the kind of basically you had like a four, three or four year. I'm 21 year 18. So
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.760]   three year advantage on me in terms of this stuff, right? Yeah, which I which I wish I'd just done
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:37.520]   earlier. Now, that's okay. You have a lot of time, a lot more than longevity works. Yes,
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.440]   yes. Let's go for that. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of drug right
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.320]   now, like metformin or something. Yeah, I do that. But it's like, kind of awkward and justified
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:51.920]   or pharmacist. Like this is a good tool. I'm like, yeah, I know. And like, do you have diabetes?
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.560]   Not exactly. What do you want it? Why do they said in time, he takes it?
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:07.040]   Yeah. Yeah. So that's okay. I'm my answer is just run a lot and do weights and eat and eat
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.760]   healthy and whatever. Right? Which I think I'm doing to at least some reasonable extent.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:20.160]   This was really interesting and fun. I mean, if there's a I'll give a track on your Twitter and
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.680]   see what you're reading. And if another title comes up that I find interesting,
