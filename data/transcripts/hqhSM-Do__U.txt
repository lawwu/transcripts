[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Well, we live in an age of hate.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   One political party hates the other.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   One nation hates another.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   But the polarity of our national and international struggles of 2022
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   are nothing new, as you can imagine.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   They're as old as sin.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Forty years ago, Pastor John said in a sermon, quote,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   "The 1980s are quickly becoming the decade of hate,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and oh, how easy it is for Christians to be sucked into one group
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   and start hating the other group," end quote.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   That's the same today.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   We're tempted to fall in line with the world and hate our human opponents,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   but oh, what a very different calling God gives to His church.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And to understand God's countercultural calling for us today in 2022,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   we rewind 41 years to hear a clip from a John Piper sermon
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   he was preaching on 1 Timothy 2, verses 1 to 4.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's one of my favorite sermons,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   especially when we face geopolitical chaos in the world.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It's an early sermon preached on January 20, 1981.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   We heard another clip from the same sermon last Wednesday.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   There I mentioned that this sermon was preached two days before
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   the Iran hostage crisis came to an end,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and the same day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   as the new president of the United States.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So there was a lot of national and international news in the air
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   when Piper preached on 1 Timothy 2, verses 1 to 4.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   The Apostle Paul's words were very relevant.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Paul was eager for Christians to hold to the faith with a good conscience,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   according to 1 Timothy 1.19.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   That includes, as Paul explains, that Christians take a global worldview
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   to offer supplications and prayers and intercessions
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and thanksgivings be made for all people,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   for kings and for all who are in high positions,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   godly and dignified in every way.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   For this is good and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   That's 1 Timothy 2, verses 1 to 4.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Piper took up this plea from Paul and preached on
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   what it meant to pray for others in the age of global hate.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's a great blessing to have our daily bread.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's a great blessing to have our trespasses forgiven.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's a great blessing not to be led into temptation,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   but to be delivered from evil.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But we don't pray. Jesus didn't teach us to pray.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Lord bless us. Amen.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   He taught us to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   We have not been taught to pray in broad sweeping generalities.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We have been taught to pray for particular kinds of problems.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And when Paul wanted help for himself,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   he asked the churches, "Pray for me in particular.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Don't just pray for the missionary cause, for example."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Therefore, I do not think that we will satisfy the demand of 1 Timothy 2, 1
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   if we say something like, "God bless all men everywhere. Amen."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   What does it mean? How can we satisfy it?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   If we give Paul a sympathetic reading here,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   that's what you always should try to give anything you read.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Give it a sympathetic reading.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Try to put yourself in the shoes of the writer.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I think what he's going to say is something like this.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   "Timothy, push out the boundaries of your concern.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Don't let your prayers be limited to any group or any kind of people.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Enlarge the circumference of your love, Timothy.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Don't be provincial or sectarian or elitist or nationalistic or racist in your prayers, Timothy.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Let your prayers embrace all kinds of people,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   high and low, white and black, Democrats and Republicans,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Soviet premiers and Iranian ayatollahs.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Enlarge the heart of your prayers, Timothy.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Go to school at Calvary and learn to hate the bigotry and the racism
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   of the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazis,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   but to pray with earnest yearning for those men and women."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Isn't Paul's point the same as Jesus?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   You have heard that it was said,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   "Love your neighbor, but hate your enemy."
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   But I say to you, love your enemy and do what?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Pray for those who persecute you so that you may become sons of your father who in heaven.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Or to put it another way, Timothy, there is no category of people of whom it can be said,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   "You ought not to pray for those."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   There is none.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And here's a message for our day, isn't it?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   The 1980s are becoming the decade of hate.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And oh, how easy it is for Christians to be sucked into one group
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and start hating the other group.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Jesus warned us in Matthew 24 11,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and because wickedness is multiplied, the love of many will grow cold."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   May it not be said of Bethlehem Baptist Church
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   that we've made any contribution to the destruction of the world through icy hate,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   but let it be said of the Christians at Bethlehem,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and oh, of all Christians, behold how they love one another.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Look how they do good to those who hate them.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Look how they bless those who curse them.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Look how they pray for those who abuse them.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Look at the parameters of their prayer.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Why, there's no boundary.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Isn't that the point of 1 Timothy 2 1?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And if we pray like that and act like that, won't people begin to say,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   "There must be a God of grace in the heavens,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and he's got a peculiar people on earth and in Minneapolis at this corner,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   people who are not conformed to this age or to this decade."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And now, after he stressed the wideness of the circumference,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   for some reason, Paul focuses in on kings and all in high positions.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Pray for kings and all in high positions.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Why?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Why did he narrow in here?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It's clear from verses 4 through 7 that Paul wants to emphasize
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   that nobody be excluded from our goodwill,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   for nobody is beyond the grace of God.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Why then do kings and people in high positions come in for special mention?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I think there are at least two reasons, perhaps more, but I'll just mention two.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   The first is this.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   There are characteristics, aren't there, about leaders that make it hard to pray for them,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   at least hard for those early Christians to pray for them,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and I think still for us in many ways.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   One, for example, of those characteristics is that they are so distant and so remote,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   if not visually or in miles, then in accessibility anyway.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   They're so remote, and it's hard to pray for somebody earnestly,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   with heart yearning that you don't even know or don't ever see.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And yet Paul says that difficulty must be overcome.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   We must pray for the Emperor Nero.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   We must pray for the governor, Galio.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   We must pray for proconsuls, and we must pray for Pilate and Herod and the like.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Those people must be prayed for if you don't ever see them.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   They may seem remote to you.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   They are not remote to God,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and you can get as close to them through prayer as any of their closest advisors.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Here's another example of a characteristic that makes them hard to pray for.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   They are often godless people, insensitive to the promptings of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That was almost universally true in Paul's day.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And I think in our day, if you take all the countries of the world,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   and let's not just limit this command to America,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   it's probably still true today.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It doesn't matter where or when we have lived.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   If we're going to pray for those who are kings and all in high positions,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   we are going to wind up praying mostly for people who are hostile to or indifferent to our faith,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and that seems to be a stumbling block for many people.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   What do I pray for them?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Well, Paul says, "Don't hesitate to pray."
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   First of all, God can save, God can change kings and those in high positions.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And second, he uses unbelievers in high positions to accomplish his purposes anyway,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   whether they believe or not.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   A couple of examples.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   In Isaiah 10 in the Old Testament, God takes the wicked king of Assyria
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   and turns him into a rod of his wrath when he wants to punish his people Israel.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And then he casts him aside because of his arrogance when he's through with him.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Once Nebuchadnezzar, the great proud king of Babylon, said this,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   "Is not this great Babylon which I have built by my mighty power
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   as a royal residence for the glory of my majesty?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   You know what God did?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Took away his reason and made him eat grass like an ox.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Until he learned this lesson, Daniel 4, verse 34.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Nebuchadnezzar says, "The dominion of the Most High is an everlasting dominion,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and his kingdom endures from generation to generation.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and he does according to his will in the host of heaven
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   and among the inhabitants of the earth,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   and none can stay his hand or say to him, 'What doest thou?'"
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   No king, no president, no Soviet premier or Iranian ayatollah
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   can stay his hand when he has purpose to do a thing.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hands of the Lord.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   He turns it wherever he will," the wise man said.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   "Many are the plans of a man and a king,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   but the purposes of the Lord will be established."
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Proverbs 19, 21.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Therefore, we have strong encouragement to pray
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   because God rules over men whether they believe him or not.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   God reigns and none can stay his hand.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Now, one implication of that is that our prayers for these kings
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   and these people in high positions will not only be for their conversion
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   or even their sanctification.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   That we must pray for or we disobey our Lord Jesus,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   but we will go beyond that and we will pray
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   that God's good saving purposes be accomplished through them anyway,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   even if they are impenitent.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And that's the second reason why I think Paul mentions
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   the need to pray for kings and those in high positions,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   because God is able to do so much good in the world
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   through people in high positions.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Even a bad king, Paul thinks, is better than anarchy.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Paul is in a Roman prison or is under house arrest in Rome
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   when he writes 1 Timothy.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   The emperor is Nero.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   In a couple of years, he's going to put Paul to death.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Probably he died in the lion's arena.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Now, Paul is saying what he says under those conditions.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Therefore, he is not naive when he says,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   "Make thanksgivings for all men, for kings and all in high positions."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Thank God for Nero.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Why? How can he say that?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   At least for this reason.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Paul's perspective on the world is so good.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's so big.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   It goes above and beyond his own little life
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   or even his own little great ministry.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   The emperor who puts Paul to death in Rome
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   keeps peace in the provinces where the gospel is spreading like wildfire.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And for that, Paul is very thankful.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   So our prayers for kings and for leaders and for all men
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   should be seasoned with thanksgiving.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But the main thing Paul says to pray for is this,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   in all godliness and respectfulness.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Now, taken by itself, that might seem to fly right in the face of everything I've said.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Is it really the case that in the last analysis,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   the only reason we pray for leaders is so that we might have the good life?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   So that we might have peace and tranquility and build our estates?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   How many professing Christians seem to think so?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But that would be a terrible misunderstanding of this text, wouldn't it?
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Because verses 3 and 4 sharpen the focus of what Paul is really after.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   "Why," he answers, "why pray that we have peace and tranquility?"
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Answer, this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   who desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   God approves of peace and tranquility because he approves of the advance of the gospel.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Peace is not the main thing.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Salvation is the main thing.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Tranquility is not the main goal.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   The knowledge of the gospel of truth is the main goal.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   May we never forget it, brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   that we are exiles here in America.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And I would say the same thing if I were talking to the Russians, the Iranians, the Mexicans, the Brazilians.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   We are exiles here in this land.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   We are not at home in America, Russia, Iran, Egypt, Israel, or anywhere on this earth.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Our commonwealth is in heaven.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   We do not pray, I do not pray, simply for the prosperity of any land.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I pray for the magnificent spread of the saving purposes of God in every land
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and for whatever conditions it takes to achieve that.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Powerful, especially given the historical setting of the sermon.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   The sermon is titled "Pray for Kings and All in High Positions," preached on January 18, 1981,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   two days before the Iran hostage crisis ended
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the new president of the United States.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   The entire sermon is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the time stamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   That's our email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Well, if you've read and studied the Gospels, you notice that in the life of Christ,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   there's not a lot of detail about temple practices, in particular, animal sacrifices.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   We know that Jesus as a small child was presented at the temple
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   along with an offering of turtle doves or pigeons.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   We see that in Luke 2, but that's rare.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   In fact, in his ministry later, Jesus forgives sin himself
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and seems to bypass the whole sacrificial system altogether.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Why?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We're rejoined in studio with Pastor John for that on Friday.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   It's a really good Bible question, and we will see you on Friday for that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Thanks for listening.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Bye.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   [Silence]
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.060]   you
