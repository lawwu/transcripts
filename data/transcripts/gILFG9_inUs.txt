[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   Meditation is probably one of the best key habits because it gets rid of that one thing that makes you not want to go to the gym, which is stress.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.020]   That makes you not want to eat healthy, which is stress.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.580]   That makes you not want to be nice, which is stress.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.140]   That makes you not sleep well, which is stress.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:25.020]   So stress can be tied to most of the bad habits that we, we have in our lives.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:38.460]   Meditation will help manufacture endogenous chemicals, such as serotonin, dopamine, and anandamine, and all the bliss chemicals, oxytocin, that mill stress away inside of the body.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:50.540]   And when you have a body that is freer of stress, then you naturally feel more inclined to do the other things that you know you want to do in order to have the best life possible.
