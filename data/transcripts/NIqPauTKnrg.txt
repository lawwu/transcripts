[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Pastor John, last Friday in episode 263, you said that the essence of worship is
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   not what we do with our lips or hands or knees or tongues, but what happens in our
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   heart. Affections for God that correspond to the truth He reveals about Himself.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.880]   So what about times when we don't have those affections? Are you saying then that
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.280]   when we feel no emotion, we cannot be truly worshiping God?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.280]   Let's remember the text, first of all, from yesterday. It's Matthew 15, 7.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.280]   "You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, 'This people honors me with their lips,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   but their heart is far from me. In vain do they worship me.'"
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:52.280]   So this is a text that says it is empty, it's vain, it's non-worship, if it's only lip worship.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.280]   And I argued that that's just willpower religion. They had the willpower to move their lips,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.280]   go to church, sing the songs, but it's not worship to just move your lips.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.280]   There needed to be emotions like contrition, sorrow, longing, desire, fear, awe, gratitude, joy, hope.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   These are essential to be a real worshiper.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.280]   So now the question is being raised, what do you do if those emotions are absent?
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   Can you worship? Should you even go to church?
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280]   What do you do if you're sitting in the pew and those emotions aren't there?
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   Should you get up and leave?
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   Now the answer to that question is very delicate.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.280]   It has to be handled, I think, with pastoral care and biblical faithfulness.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   Our emotions, our spiritual affections, and when I say emotions, I'm not talking about physical things
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   like sweaty palms or fluttering eyelashes or wobbly knees or butterflies in the stomach or anything like that.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   I'm talking about real spiritual affections rising in the heart.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   Now they rise and fall.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   We are seldom the same in the morning that we are in the evening.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   We are affected by many things in the rise and fall of our spiritual affections,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   from weariness to hunger to Satan to sinning.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   A lot of things affect how intensely we feel God, and so I don't want to be naive at all that there's just one strain
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.280]   and that's 100% engagement of your affections, and short of that, there's nothing worthwhile.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   That's not true.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   Let's use David for an example.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   Psalm 40, "I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   He set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Well, David was in a pit with no song, and that means he was emotionally flat.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   Could he worship in the pit, waiting for a song?
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   "I waited for the Lord.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   I waited."
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   I don't know how long he had to wait.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   I preached a sermon one time called "In the Pits with the King,"
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   and I'm so encouraged that David had these pit experiences because everybody else does too, if we're honest.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   Sometimes you have to wait a long time, so could he worship in the pit,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   or could he only worship after he got out of the pit?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   I think the answer is his waiting for the Lord was worship.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   It wasn't what he wanted it to be because he had a new song when he got out,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   and then he saw the new song, and they were moved to trust the Lord.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   But he was not waiting for pills, and he was not waiting for somebody else.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   He was waiting for God because he had tasted and seen that the Lord was good.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   So here's my way of describing the levels of worship that move from the strongest to the weakest to non-existence.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   So here's really my answer to, "Can you worship when your emotions are flat or gone?"
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   The highest level of worship is when you see some aspect of God's glory,
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   and you feel affections that are corresponding to that glory, grace, justice, goodness, wrath, wisdom of God,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   something you see, your eyes are open, the Spirit moves, thankfulness or admiration or contrition or wonder or hope well up in your heart.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   It's lively. We feel it, and then we can express it. That's the top level of worship.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   Second, we see God in some measure—we're moving down now to a less than ideal—
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   we see God in some measure in his glory, but the corresponding affections are just not lively.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   They're scarcely there. What we see is true, and we long for those emotions to be there, but they're not.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   We've tasted that God is good, we remember it, and we ache for the former love and for the former passion and affections.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   And my answer is that that ache and that longing for what we're not presently experiencing is genuine worship, is genuine affection for God.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   It's not ideal, but it is a reflection of God's worth and value that you ache to want him, you ache to love him,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   you ache to delight in him like you once did. And that very ache is worship.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   And the third is we see God weakly, and we're unmoved by this weak sight.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:19.280]   We're so down and so lifeless that we not only don't have the corresponding affections worthy of God,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   but we don't even feel a desire for them.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   Now, this is getting scary. We are blank. There remains a seed of some new life in us,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   but it expresses itself not in, "Oh, Lord, I want to want."
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   Instead, it expresses itself in a bare regret that we don't long for anything.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   But we still can feel some seed of regret, some remorse, some sorrow at how utterly blank and flat we have become toward God
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   that we don't even want to want him. We're just sorry for the mess we're in.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   And my answer is that sorrow, that regret is worship.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   It's far from ideal, but it's still a seed that reflects what we're missing,
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   and we know we're missing it, and it reflects itself in that regret.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   Now, there is one step below that, and it is non-worship.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   We see no beauty in God. We feel no admiration for God.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   We feel no longing to have those affections for God, and we feel no regret.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   And we feel no conviction, and we feel no remorse.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   And I would say at that point, "No, you cannot worship. I don't care what you do.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   Go to church, sing, pray, jump up and down. You can't worship because your heart is gone."
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   So my answer to the question is, yes, there are levels of worship when the affections are weak or almost gone.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   But if all the affections are gone, there is no longer any worship.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   If there's no longing to desire, if there's no regret or remorse at failing to long for the desire for God,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.280]   then we are beyond worship.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   At that point, we are utterly cast upon the sovereign grace of God alone,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   and there's nothing in us until he creates it.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   Yeah, that's very sobering. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   And for more on this theme, you can find a book by Pastor John at DesiringGod.org,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   which is titled "When I Don't Desire God," and you can download the book free of charge.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   And speaking of the importance of the affections, see the recent Ask Pastor John episode,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   which is titled "Why Stoicism is Toxic," and that's episode number 239.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   And also the episode titled "How Do I Own Biblical Truths for Myself," which is episode number 183,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   which talks a lot about how our affections are tied to our personal discoveries of truth in the Bible.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   And, of course, you can find that sermon mentioned earlier, "In the Pits with the King," from back in 1980.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   You can find that at DesiringGod.org as well.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   We'll be back tomorrow with a new episode.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   Until then, I'm Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
