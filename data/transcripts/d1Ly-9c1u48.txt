[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460]   Here's a question I see often in the inbox, but we're just getting to it now.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.920]   Why does God threaten to end the lives of some Christians?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.680]   Today's email comes from a baffled listener named Mike.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.800]   "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.400]   Every time our church celebrates the Lord's Supper, the appropriate warnings are sounded.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.360]   It's not for non-Christians.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.940]   It's not for Christians harboring resentment.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.220]   But I remain rather confused about 1 Corinthians 11 verses 27 to 32, a text that appears to
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.600]   be delivered to true Christians.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.360]   So their abrupt discipline will prevent their eventual condemnation.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.680]   Why would God physically kill one of his children and end their earthly lives early?
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.420]   Couldn't he sustain them to the end just as easily?
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.860]   Can you explain the merciful judgment on believers Paul is talking about here?"
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.780]   My guess is that this question will seem strange to some of our listeners.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.540]   Why would God physically kill one of his children?
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.840]   That's what he's asking.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.100]   Or even if we soften it and avoid the word "kill," why would God take one of his children
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.060]   home as a means of discipline to prevent condemnation when he might have prevented it another way?
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660]   That's the gist of the question.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.020]   But it is a very good question, and it's demanded by 1 Corinthians 11, 27 to 32.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.020]   So let me read that so everybody is with us in this question.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.120]   We're not making this up.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.540]   It says, "Whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup," meaning the Lord's Supper,
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:54.340]   "of the Lord in an unworthy manner," which I take to mean a cavalier, minimizing, unbelieving,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.220]   careless way, "will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord."
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.180]   In other words, if you treat lightly and disrespectfully and irreverently the precious emblems of the
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.100]   Lord's crucifixion, you're showing that you don't cherish and tremble at the horror and
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.020]   preciousness of the real crucifixion.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.740]   I think that's the logic.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.760]   Verse 28, "Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.540]   For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body," that is, without seriously distinguishing
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.260]   this bread from a breakfast biscuit, "eats and drinks judgment on himself."
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.260]   That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.180]   So three levels of severity, it sounds like—weakness, sickness, death.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.740]   But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.380]   But when we are judged by the Lord—that is, with weakness or sickness or death—when
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.220]   we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.460]   the world.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:28.420]   So weakness and sickness and even death are the Lord's discipline to prevent His people
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.300]   from being condemned to hell.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.860]   So there's the reality that raises the question.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.860]   The question is not whether God has the right to take life.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.060]   Mike is granting that.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.660]   The Lord gives, the Lord takes away, "Blessed be the name of the Lord," Job said, and
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.540]   Mike is believing that.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.060]   The question is, if God is taking the life of one of His children so that they will not
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.740]   be condemned to everlasting destruction, couldn't He have spared them another way, namely by
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.300]   causing them to eat the Lord's Supper more respectfully?
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.420]   And so why wouldn't He do that?
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.580]   That's the question.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.620]   And the answer to the question is, God could indeed prevent the desecration of the Lord's
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.500]   Supper by restraining the desecration.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.940]   Yes, He could.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.580]   For example, in Genesis 26, when Abimelech the king was about to defile Abraham's wife
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.220]   Sarah, God kept him from doing it.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.780]   It says, "It was I who kept you from sinning against Me."
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.700]   So He can do it for a pagan king.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.900]   He can do it for His children.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.380]   He can keep them from sinning at the Lord's table.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.540]   And in the New Testament, God works in His people to keep them pursuing holiness, at
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.300]   least to the measure that they have.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.980]   Hebrews 13.21, 2 Thessalonians 1.11, 1 Corinthians 15.10, Philippians 2.12, 1 Peter 1.5, God
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.140]   works in His people to restrain them from sin and lead them in holiness.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.820]   So God could have prevented the desecration of the Lord's Supper and thus prevent the
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.380]   discipline that He brings on those who desecrate it.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.740]   So why doesn't He?
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.180]   Now, before I try to answer that, let's be sure that we see how sweeping this question
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.180]   is.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:38.140]   This question really is a specific instance of asking the larger question, "Why is there
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.260]   any divine discipline in the Christian life?"
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.580]   Not just why does God use the final discipline of taking a life, but why would there be any
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.020]   physical or mental or relational difficulties brought into the Christian life as a way of
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.900]   preventing their sin and advancing their holiness?
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.860]   Why not just prevent the sin and create the holiness by faith and by a clear sight of
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.580]   Jesus and by the ordinary means of word and prayer?
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.660]   Why should there be any form of painful discipline in the life of God's children?
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.420]   That's the larger question implied in the specific one.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:28.800]   So let's be sure that we know God does discipline His children with more or less painful things
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.580]   in their life, and we know that because of Hebrews 12, Hebrews 12, 4 to 10.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.740]   It says, "In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.940]   shedding your blood.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:51.100]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.100]   Him.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.460]   For the Lord disciplines the one He loves and chastises every son—that's important—chastises
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.380]   every son whom He receives.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.540]   It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.820]   God is treating you as sons.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.080]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.700]   He disciplines us for our good, that we may share His holiness."
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:24.780]   First Corinthians 11:30 is one description of that, what we just read from Hebrews 12.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.160]   It happens at different levels.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   For some, it's weakness.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.080]   For some, it's illness.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   For some, it's death.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.280]   And don't forget the words, "The Lord disciplines the one He loves."
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.860]   He loves.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.540]   He loves.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.240]   If He makes us weak, He's loving us.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.940]   If He makes us ill, He's loving us.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:52.040]   If He takes our life, He's loving us.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.700]   Now why does God do it this way?
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.280]   Why not just perfect us all overnight?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.400]   That really is what the question boils down to.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.920]   Or why doesn't He bring us to greatest holiness with no painful discipline?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.600]   Just read your Bible and pray and be holy and no painful discipline at all.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.400]   And my answer goes something like this.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:29.000]   God knows the best way to bring about in His children, one, a love for His absolute holiness.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.960]   Two, a hatred of our bent to sinning.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.480]   Three, the gratitude for His amazing grace and patience in our lives.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.680]   Four, a passion to trust Him in every circumstance of life.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.280]   He knows the best way to do this.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:57.200]   So let's be careful that we don't decide what's best and tell Him how to do it.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.520]   We watch Him and learn what's best.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:09.320]   He knows best how to produce these great wonders in His church, and we shouldn't second-guess
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   Him.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.560]   Indeed, we should not.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   Well, for everything you need to know about this podcast, you can find it at DesiringGod.org/AskJohn.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.560]   Well, the book of Job is profound.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.920]   It's worth a lifetime of study and reflection.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.600]   But was Job himself a real historical character like John Bunyan?
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.920]   Or is Job a mythical legend like Paul Bunyan?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.400]   And would it really matter in the end which he was, a biographical fact or a morality
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   tale?
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.040]   That question is up next time on Friday.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   It's a good one.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.160]   We'll see you then.
