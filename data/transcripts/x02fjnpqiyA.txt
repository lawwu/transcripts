[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   I just finished a six mile run in good old below freezing Boston weather.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   A bit too dark, a bit too icy, but probably good for the mind and soul.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.060]   So I thought it'd be a good time to make this video and say that
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.300]   for the second year now, Mr.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.840]   David Goggins is doing the four by four by 48 challenge
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.060]   at 8 p.m. Pacific on Friday, March 5th.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.780]   That's running 48 miles in 48 hours by doing four miles every four hours.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.020]   But this time, friends, him and I are doing it together in person.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.740]   Just him and I, probably in the middle of a desert somewhere.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.200]   Probably we're just one of us returning home alive.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860]   And I think you know which one it is.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.000]   We'll do a podcast before and after.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   Also, he'll go live on Instagram at the beginning of every four hour leg.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.160]   I have not been training much at all, to be honest.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.840]   And this video is a quick explanation of how I'm training for this challenge.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500]   Starting today in a way that gives me a reasonable fitness base
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.680]   while still letting me be productive in all the different things I have going on.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.840]   I took on this challenge with David on a bit of a leap of faith
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.440]   and a bit of madness in order to test myself mentally and physically.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.140]   But also because I often take this kind of leap into things
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.640]   that seemed very stupid at the time.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.820]   But when all is said and done, I almost always become a better person
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.940]   because of it.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.360]   So if you're out there a little bit out of shape like me,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.400]   I'm hoping you join me in getting back to exercising this month
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.780]   and perhaps taking on the challenge along with me, along with David, along with us.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.160]   If you're not a runner, you can just do some sort of exercise
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.540]   for 40 to 60 minutes every four hours instead.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.920]   If you want to get involved, check links in the description
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.000]   for more information, I think.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.380]   But mostly just tag me and David if you're stepping your fitness up
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.800]   in any kind of way this month as you train and if you're participating
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.880]   in the challenge.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.640]   I know it'll be inspiring to me to see anybody who's just getting out there,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.440]   since to be honest, this would be a ridiculously big challenge for me
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.060]   with everything I have going on.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.440]   So I can probably use all the inspiration you got.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.060]   OK, so training wise, check out the Google sheet of my training
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.900]   in the description.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.280]   But it's pretty basic.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   The focus, as usual, is to establish a ritual, a habit of daily exercise
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.860]   and then increasing duration a little bit every week.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620]   So maybe let me first speak to the principle of that.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.280]   I know that for muscle building and for increasing race performance,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.420]   it's good to mix up workouts from long to short sprints,
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.160]   that kind of thing with rest days and just mixing it up throughout the week.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.620]   But I don't know about anyone else.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.380]   But for me, that has only really worked when I'm already in really good shape.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.300]   What for me has been more beneficial, more effective
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.760]   is to focus on building up the habit of exercise every day, the same thing.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.940]   The habit and ritual of it lessens the need
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.520]   and the reliance on motivation and day to day motivation.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.600]   So for me, the training is easily integrated into the day.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.100]   It has two parts. One is cardio.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.980]   One is bodyweight exercises.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.140]   And the schedule is pretty basic.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.440]   I run a medium distance every day, Monday through Friday,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.900]   and a long distance run on Saturday and then rest on Sunday.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.000]   So specifically for me, that means week one, what I'm doing now,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.120]   six miles each day, then week two is seven miles.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.960]   Week three is eight miles.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.740]   Week four is nine miles.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.120]   So we're about four and a half weeks off from the challenge.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.300]   I think two or three days before the challenge, I'll take complete rest days.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.460]   So my recommendation to you for what it's worth is to pick a cardio exercise
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.760]   that you can stick to on a daily basis.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.600]   So running, cycling, swimming, even walking,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   and just build the habit and do an intensity and duration
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.100]   that doesn't break your body down, but it's still challenging.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.240]   Just keeps challenging you, but not too much.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.100]   Not causing injury, not causing over exertion, over exhaustion.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.440]   On the bodyweight exercise side, for me, that's six days of exercise
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.520]   that includes pushups, pull ups, bodyweight squats
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.740]   and these ab roller things for the abs, for the core.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.080]   I do it in rounds of 20 pushups,
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.280]   10 pull ups, 10 ab rollers and 10 squats.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.340]   My recommendation, again, take it with a grain of salt,
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.840]   is if you do bodyweight exercises, pick numbers within the round
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.920]   that allows you to do timed rounds without much rest in between.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.220]   Maybe no more than one minute's rest
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.340]   and do essentially a full body workout, but not to exhaustion.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.340]   And I know a lot of people are going to say, you know, rest days
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.180]   are really essential.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.780]   You want to alternate upper body, lower body, push, pull,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.360]   all those kinds of things.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.440]   All of that is true when you're trying to achieve maximum performance.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.920]   What I find for me in a busy life when I have a million things going on,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.040]   building the habit, building the ritual of exercise
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.800]   and not pushing myself to exhaustion is the most effective way
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.000]   to stay healthy and just to feel good and make sure the exercise
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   stays part of my life.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.300]   You probably didn't ask me, but that's my recommendation
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.020]   if you're starting from being kind of out of shape to building up shape
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.320]   for doing something like that 48 mile challenge.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.140]   But you should also definitely read a lot of different advice
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.520]   that's out there and integrate it in a way that works for your own schedule,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.280]   for your own body, all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.440]   On the diet side, I'm eating clean as usual, just meat and veggies.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.780]   The veggies are mostly cauliflower and green beans, my two favorites.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.880]   And on the meat side is ground beef actually from Belcampo Farms.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.300]   They sent me a ton of meat and it's delicious.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.580]   On the supplement side, I'm doing the usual
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.220]   athletic greens every morning, plus fish oil
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.180]   and electrolytes before and after the run.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.360]   You should definitely check out Athletic Greens and Belcampo Farms.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.620]   They are both somehow amazingly now sponsors of the podcast that I host.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.780]   After I posted about how much I love their stuff.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.920]   And also check out cauliflower, especially in rice form.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.120]   It's a game changer.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.760]   So at least my training regimen is pretty simple.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   Run basically every day, body weight exercises every day.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.960]   Don't overexert and gradually increase the duration of the exercise.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.960]   And the rest is just in the mind.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.460]   And I'm hoping I am mentally tough enough to not die with David Calkins.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.640]   I thought to post this video, you know, hopefully to inspire others
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.560]   to step up their exercise game this month, to run, to cycle,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.480]   all that kind of stuff, and maybe even join in on this crazy challenge.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.180]   I think it's a really perfect balance of testing the body and mind.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.580]   Just being able to persevere through this 48 hour period.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.760]   It's just long enough to where it's not this kind of shorter marathon
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.220]   run of suffering.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.400]   You kind of have to suffer just a little bit every four hours.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   It's honestly just a huge honor to be able to do this kind of thing
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.980]   with David Goggins.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.520]   We were just supposed to do the podcast.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.980]   But of course, as he does with everybody he meets,
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.020]   he pulls you in and challenges you to push yourself to your own limits
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.980]   to discover yourself.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.740]   And I think that's kind of what this whole life is about,
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.320]   is to do difficult things and in the process
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.200]   be able to discover something about yourself
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.960]   that you wouldn't be able to discover in any kind of way.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.700]   There's some kind of magic in the challenge that allows you to put a mirror
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.420]   to yourself, to meet your demons, to overcome them.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.260]   And then the rest of life becomes easy or at least easier.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.680]   The training in Boston is definitely a bit rough right now.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.940]   It's been below freezing for many days in a row.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   So it's starting to feel a lot like Rocky IV,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   except in this version, the Russian is the out of shape
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.820]   underdog training in the snow.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.320]   And it's the American who says, if he dies, he dies.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.280]   So we'll see what happens.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.860]   I love you all.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.020]   Love.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.100]   Love.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.180]   Love.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.260]   Love.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.340]   Love.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.420]   Love.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.500]   Love.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.580]   Love.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.660]   Love.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.660]   Love.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.660]   Love.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.660]   Love.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.660]   Love.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.660]   Love.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.660]   Love.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.660]   Love.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.660]   Love.
