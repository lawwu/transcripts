[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   I'd love to talk a little bit about hormone replacement therapy in men.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.660]   When one looks on social media and the internet, there seems to be a younger and younger cohort
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.640]   of guys, people in their teens and 20s showing up to the table thinking that injecting testosterone
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.580]   cypionate or taking Anivar or whatever it is is going to be the right idea.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.600]   There mainly seem to be focus on cosmetic effects.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.880]   I'm not a physician, so I can't say whether or not they were actually hypogonadal, etc.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.820]   But it seems to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that similar to
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.600]   the Atiyah's rule as it relates to longevity, that we could come up with a broad contour
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.520]   rule in which if a male of any age is not trying to get decent sleep, exercise appropriately,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.720]   appropriate nutrition, minding their social connections, etc., etc., the idea of going
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.540]   straight to testosterone seems like a bad idea.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.740]   That said, just like with depression and antidepressants, there is a kind of a cliff after which low
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.380]   enough testosterone or low enough serotonin prevents people from sleeping, exercise, social
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.980]   connection, etc., so I do want to acknowledge that.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.020]   But with that in mind, how do you think about and perhaps occasionally prescribe and direct
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.420]   your patients in terms of hormone replacement therapy in men, person in their 30s, person
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.900]   in their 40s, who's doing almost all the other things correctly?
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.080]   What sorts of levels do you think are meaningful?
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.980]   Because the range is tremendous in terms of blood tests, 300 nanograms per deciliter, I
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.180]   think on the low end now in the US, all the way up to 900 or 1200, that's an enormous
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.180]   range.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.500]   What are some of the other hormones you like to look at, estrogen, DHT, and so on?
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.700]   So a lot to unpack there.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.380]   So let's start with the ranges, right?
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.740]   So the ranges you gave are for total testosterone, of course, and we don't spend a lot of time
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.900]   looking at that the way we used to spend more time looking at total and free when I used
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.920]   more tricks to modulate it.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.460]   So I'm actually far more simple in my manipulation of testosterone today than I was six or seven
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.460]   years ago.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:24.500]   Six or seven years ago, I mean, we would use a microdose of Anovar to lower SHBG in a person
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.740]   who had normal testosterone but low free testosterone.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.620]   What was a low dose of Anovar in that context?
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.140]   10 milligrams subling, two to three times a week.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.780]   Anovar basically being DHT, Oxandrolone, that guy has used it.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.780]   And again, we're not recommending this.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.460]   This is actually, if you're playing a competitive sport, it can get you banned from that sport.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.460]   No, no, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.020]   It can also get you banned from having children if you do it incorrectly.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.980]   So a microdose of this has to be small enough that it doesn't impair your body's ability
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.780]   to make testosterone.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.220]   But Anovar has such a high affinity for SHBG that it basically distracts your SHBG from
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.140]   binding your testosterone.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140]   Freeing up testosterone.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.140]   That's exactly right.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.520]   So the goal was, how do I just give you more free testosterone?
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.900]   So if a patient shows up and they've got a total testosterone of 900 nanograms per deciliter,
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.600]   which would place them at, you know, depending on the scale you look at.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.940]   The scale we look at, that would place you at about the 70th percentile.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.340]   But your free testosterone is, you know, 8 nanograms per deciliter.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.340]   So that's pretty bad.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.820]   That means you're less than 1% free.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.820]   A guy should be about 2% free T. So that dude should be closer to 16 to 18 nanograms per
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.580]   deciliter.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.220]   So in that situation that I just gave you, his SHBG is really high.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.900]   His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.900]   That's very high.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   Because I think the upper range is somewhere around 55-56.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900]   Exactly.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.940]   So we would first backstall for what's driving his SHBG.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.660]   So there's basically three hormones.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.300]   So genetics plays a huge role in this.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.740]   There's no question that just out of the box, people have a different like set point for
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.740]   SHBG.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.740]   Mine is incredibly low.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.920]   My SHBG is like kind of in the 30s, 20s to 30s.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.340]   But from a hormone perspective, there's basically three hormones that run it.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.560]   So estradiol being probably the most important, insulin, and thyroxine.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   So we're going to look at all of those and decide if any of those are playing a role.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.680]   So insulin suppresses it.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.480]   So this is actually the great irony of helping a person get metabolically healthy is in the
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.360]   short run you can actually lower their free testosterone all things equal.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.400]   Because as insulin comes down, SHBG goes up.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.940]   And if testosterone hasn't gone up with it, you're lowering free testosterone.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.720]   So somebody who goes on a very low carbohydrate diet and attempt to drop some water and drop
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.920]   some weight is going to increase their SHBG.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   If their insulin goes down.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.440]   Bind up testosterone, less free testosterone.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   I can tell the carnivore diet people are going to be coming after me with bone marrow in
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   hand.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.480]   But then again, after this discussion extends a little further, I'm sure the vegans will
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.280]   be coming after me with celery stalks.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.520]   So then the same is with estradiol, except in the opposite direction.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720]   So higher estradiol is higher SHBG.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.040]   So again, occasionally you'll see a guy with normal testosterone, but he's a very high
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.720]   aromatase activity person.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.840]   So he has a lot of the enzyme that converts testosterone into estradiol.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.960]   You can lower estradiol a bit with an aromatase inhibitor and that can bring down SHBG.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.720]   Now again, these things individually are rarely enough to move the needle.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.040]   The last is thyroxine.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.320]   So if you have a person whose thyroid is out of whack, you have to fix that before you,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.120]   if their T4 is out of whack, you're going to interfere with SHBG.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.680]   There are also some supplements, which I think you've probably talked about these on the
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   podcast.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.680]   I feel like I've heard you talk about these on the podcast.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   There are a few that will adjust.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   You know, there is this idea.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   Now there's a much better review.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   It just came out.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   I'll send it to you.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   I'd love your thoughts on it.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.920]   I'm reading it line by line, but I'd love input from experts like you on the use of
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.460]   Tonga Ali for reducing SHBG.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.420]   In my experience, it does free up some testosterone by which mechanism, it isn't exactly clear
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.960]   and the effects aren't that dramatic.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Right.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   There are probably multiple effects.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.240]   For all we know, it increases libido and it does generally by way of increasing estrogen
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.640]   slightly, which can also increase libido in some individuals.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.000]   So we don't know the exact mode of action.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So we've talked about a few.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.880]   The one that a few years back people were claiming could reduce SHBG was stinging nettles.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   Stinging nettle.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.600]   Well, just urine seems to be, urinating seems to be coming up multiple times on this podcast
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.760]   for whatever reason.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   Stinging nettle extract.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.920]   I took the most pronounced effect of that was you could basically urinate over a car
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.080]   when taking SHBG.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.400]   What the underlying mechanism of that was, I do not know.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   I took it for a short while.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.420]   It didn't drop my SHBG very much.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.920]   But it did drop my DHT sufficiently so that I stopped taking it.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   I do not like anything that impedes DHT.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.140]   I don't care if my hairline retreats.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.720]   I don't care about any of that.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.440]   DHT to me is something to be hoveted and held on to because you feel so much better when
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.120]   your DHT is in the appropriate range and love your thoughts on that.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.500]   Again, it really depends on the guy and it depends on what risk you're trying to manage.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   Right.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.480]   My prostate size starts to become one of the issues with DHT.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.620]   Luckily, my prostate specific antigen is low and DHT, the things that I know can reduce
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.300]   it are things like finasteride, Propecia, things like things that people take to try
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.400]   and avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT and lead to all sorts of terrible sexual
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.900]   side effects and mood-based side effects, et cetera.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.080]   But yeah, so I'm not aware of anything that can be taken in supplement form that can really
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   profoundly drop SHBG.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.320]   We don't spend much attention on it anymore.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.080]   Actually, I used to have a much more complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.680]   I would drive patients nuts with the whiteboard diagrams I would draw for them when in the
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.000]   end I think they were just like, "Dude, what do I need to take?"
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.400]   Today we take a much more simple approach.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.320]   The first question is, should you or should you have your free testosterone being higher?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.780]   That's the metric I care about is free testosterone is the first most important.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.120]   The second most important is estradiol.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   Sorry to interrupt you.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.160]   You said if you look at your total testosterone, you want the free tea to be about 2% of your
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   total.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   Well, it should be.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   Right.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   I cannot change that anymore.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.360]   So in other words, if a guy's at 1%, then I know I have to really boost his total testosterone.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.760]   If he's only going to get one to one and a half percent of it converted to free, I need
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   to boost him.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.840]   And that's why I don't care if he's outside the range.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.200]   Like I'll have a guy who's free tea.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.280]   I might have to get a guy's total tea up to 1500 to get his free tea to 18.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   I see.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   So free tea is the target.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   Free tea is what we treat.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   I like this approach.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.640]   And do you still use antivirals to try and lower SHBG?
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   I don't.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   Because it's too potent?
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.760]   No, because it's just too complicated for patients.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.640]   You know, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a drug that can't be taken orally, so you have
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   to take it under the tongue.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   Like a troche or something.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.640]   Right.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.720]   But then the, you know, I had one patient once who, even though we told him about 87 times
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.200]   that, he was like swallowing the antivirals and his liver function.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.520]   And he was like, we're talking 10 milligrams three times a week is a tiny dose.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.800]   And three months of him or whatever, two months of him swallowing that every time tripled
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.840]   his liver function test.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.120]   So it's like, it's just, I was like, you know, it's just not worth the hassle of doing this.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.160]   For you know, perfection.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.800]   In reality, we can fix this another way.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:34.200]   So, so the first order question is, do we believe clinically you will benefit from normalizing
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.240]   your free testosterone or taking it to a level, let's call it 80th to 90th percentile.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.600]   So upper normal limit of physiologic ranges.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.140]   That's the first order question.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.720]   And that's going to come down to symptoms and that's going to come down to some biomarkers.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.920]   I think there's two years ago, was it two years ago or maybe a year ago, very good study
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.880]   came out that looked at pre-diabetic men, you've probably talked about this study, and
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.640]   looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal with and without testosterone.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.600]   And the evidence was overwhelmingly clear.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.880]   Testosterone improves glycemic control.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Testosterone improves insulin signaling.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.380]   This shouldn't be surprising, by the way, given the role muscles play as a glucose reservoir
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.660]   and a glucose sink.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.080]   So now I include that as one of the things that we will consider as a factor for using
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080]   testosterone.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.760]   Now, again, it's not the only one.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.780]   So you can accomplish that with exercise, you can accomplish that with these other things,
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.460]   but then you get into a little bit of the vicious cycle of will having a normalized
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.760]   testosterone facilitate you doing those things better.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.680]   So let's just assume we come to the decision that this, this, this person is a good candidate
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.160]   for testosterone replacement therapy.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.880]   The next question is, what's the method we're going to do it?
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.420]   Are we going to do it indirectly or directly?
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.480]   Now we used to use a lot of Clomid in our practice.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.680]   And have you talked about Clomid on the podcast?
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.200]   I haven't talked too much about it.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.160]   No, we talked a little bit about the fact that some people taking things like an astrazole
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:10.120]   to reduce aromatase activity run, can potentially run into trouble because they think, oh, well,
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.720]   more testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.800]   And then they end up with issues like joint pain, memory issues, and severe drops in libido.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   And I think a lot of the reason.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.400]   And even fat accumulation.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.840]   So if estrogen is too low, you'll, you can develop adiposity in a way that you wouldn't
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   otherwise.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   There's a great New England journal paper.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.720]   It's probably 10 years old now that looked at five, I believe it was five different doses
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   of testosterone cypionate.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.880]   So these men were chemically castrated and divided into 10 groups.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880]   It's pretty remarkable.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.720]   Somebody signed up for this study.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   So you were with and without an astrazole and five doses of testosterone.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.520]   So now you basically had five testosterone levels, plus or minus high or low estradiol.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.780]   And the results were really clear that the higher your testosterone and the more your
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.200]   estradiol was in kind of that 30 to 50 range, the better you were.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.120]   So if estrogen was too low, even in the presence of high testosterone, the outcomes were less
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   significant.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.560]   So it was 30 to 50 nanograms per deciliter, not 30 to 50% of your, of one's testosterone.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   Okay.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   Great.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   Okay.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.920]   So we haven't talked, but clomid is, you know, we have not talked a lot about clomid.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.520]   I'd love to get your thoughts on clomid.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.240]   So clomiphene is a fertility drug.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.680]   It's a synthetic hormone.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.240]   It's actually two drugs, M-clomiphene and I forget the other one.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:33.680]   And it tells the pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:41.120]   So you, and so the advantage of clomid is it's oral and it's meant to be taken orally.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.580]   So you know, a typical starting dose would be like 50 milligrams, three times a week.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.680]   And if you do that, you'll notice in most men, especially young men, FSH, LH goes up.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.520]   In any man, the FSH and LH go up.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.460]   But if a man still has testicular reserve, he'll make lots of testosterone in response
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.080]   to that.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.800]   Because that's the first order question we're trying to answer is, do you, is your failure
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.600]   to make testosterone central or peripheral?
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.920]   And I think just one point out, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:18.760]   a lot of the drugs that we're talking about, the synthetic compounds, testosterone, estrogen,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.360]   things related to growth hormone, et cetera, were discovered and designed in order to treat
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.520]   and, excuse me, in order to isolate and treat exactly these kinds of syndromes, whether
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.680]   or not it was the hypothalamus, the pituitary, or the target tissue, the ovaries or the testes.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Correct.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   Correct.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.880]   I mean, I think the easiest way to go about doing this is just give the hormone that's
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.680]   missing without attention to where the deficiency is.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:49.520]   Why this becomes relevant is if you have a 35 year old guy whose testosterone is low,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.600]   but you can demonstrate that it's low because he's not getting enough of a signal from the
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.960]   pituitary, why would you bother giving him more testosterone when he has the capacity?
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.680]   He has the Leydig cells and the Sertulli cells to make testosterone.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   He just needs the signal.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.720]   Sometimes though, not always, just a course of Clomid can wake him up and he's back to
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.160]   making normal testosterone.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.960]   So he'll do this three times a week, 50 milligrams, three times a week for a short course and
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   then-
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.080]   Yeah, we would do that for eight to 12 weeks and then we reevaluate.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   And estrogen and testosterone will increase in parallel.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   Yes.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.380]   And again, it depends, you know, aromatase activity is dependent on how much body fat
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.240]   you have and genetics.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.720]   And if estradiol gets too high, we think if it gets over about 55, 60, we will give micro
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.800]   doses of an astrozole, but it has to be real micro doses.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.540]   I mean, you cannot pound people with an astrozole.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:47.160]   To give you perspective, the sort of on label use, like if you just go to a pharmacy and
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   order an astrozole, you're going to get one milligram tablets.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.840]   Like we can't give anybody a milligram.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.360]   They'll feel like garbage.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.300]   We have to have it compounded at 0.1 milligrams and we might give a patient 0.1, two to three
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.300]   times a week.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.060]   That would be a big dose of an astrozole.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:09.180]   I think that the typical TRT clinic out there is giving 200 milligrams per mil, one mil,
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.820]   200 milligrams of testosterone once every two weeks and then hitting people with multiple
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.180]   milligrams of an astrozole and they're all over the place.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.260]   I've never really understood.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.860]   I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it's kind of blows my mind that these
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.780]   TRT clinics are up all over the place given how bad, I mean, I see the results because
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:31.140]   I have patients that come from them and I don't understand like why they're so incompetent.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.660]   I actually think it's worse than that.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.700]   I think that they simply don't understand and don't care because it's a pill mill and
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.740]   it's a money mill.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.140]   I think that nowadays it seems almost everybody who's doing TRT is taking lower doses more
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.420]   frequently every other day or twice a week, dividing the dose and being very, very careful
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.740]   with these estrogen or aromatase blockers.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.180]   We, most of our patients do not take aromatase inhibitors.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.180]   It's not needed.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.300]   It's really only the high aromatizers that need it.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.820]   And so, yeah, when we'll talk about testosterone, we'll talk about dosing there because I agree,
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.620]   the more frequently you can take it, the better.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.420]   And frankly, you don't need to go more frequently than twice a week.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   Because it's so slow.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.420]   The half-life.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.900]   The half-life of the drug is, I think it's about three and a half days is the plasma
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.900]   half-life or something like that.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.900]   It could be off a little bit, but twice a week dosing is really nice.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:27.140]   So if you go to a testosterone clinic that's giving you 200 every two weeks, 50 twice a
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.220]   week is the same total dose, which by the way is a physiologic dose.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.900]   That's not going to give somebody any of the side effects you would see.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.460]   You're not going to get acne with that.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.540]   You're not going to get gynecomastia.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.540]   You're not going to get anything.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:50.780]   The only real side effect you get from that is you will get testicular atrophy.
