[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.760]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760]   My name is Saleh.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.000]   I'm a chemistry major student at KFUBM in Saudi Arabia.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.440]   I would like to ask about how someone can
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.080]   find his interest in research.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.240]   Is it by engaging in projects or just by reading papers?
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   And that's it.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600]   Thanks.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.400]   Well, when it comes to research as a student--
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.600]   and this is obviously something that I have
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320]   some personal experience with--
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.760]   I think it's important that you get
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.840]   involved in a formal student research project.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.600]   So it's very difficult on your own as a university student
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.520]   to just start reading papers and to feel like you are
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.920]   part of the research community.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.400]   So typically, most schools are going
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.960]   to have some sort of setup that allows students
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.600]   at the university level to get involved in research.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.160]   Sometimes it's formal.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.840]   Here is our student research program.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.640]   And you apply, and you get a grant.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.920]   Sometimes it's less formal.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.000]   You're just talking to specific professors and say,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.640]   can I be an informal research assistant on your project?
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.200]   I'll just be really useful.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.800]   But that is what I would recommend.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.920]   You want to be formally involved in research
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.880]   with a professor who knows what they're doing,
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.960]   that you are working and helping a actual research
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.520]   project that's moving towards real publication.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.040]   That's where you're going to learn how things really work.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.320]   That's where you're going to gain experience.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.480]   That's where you're going to open up options.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.840]   The only caveat I'm going to give you, don't be picky.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.280]   You're not going to be able to have a huge contribution
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.640]   at this level when you're brand new to research.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.960]   You're not going to be the one who figures out
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440]   the double helix structure of DNA.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.320]   You're not going to be the one who makes Fermat's last theorem
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.200]   proof actually go through.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640]   It'll probably be pretty prosaic what you're actually doing.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.560]   But what you're gaining is actual exposure
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.400]   to how research works in connection
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.360]   to people doing that research.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.560]   And so the interestingness of what you have available
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.920]   is going to increase.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.280]   The very first-- I'll just say real quickly-- the very first
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.880]   research project I was involved with as an undergraduate,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120]   I was literally walking around campus on Dartmouth.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.280]   I had a map from the IT department
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.520]   of where all of the various Wi-Fi access points were.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.880]   I would go to each Wi-Fi access point.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.840]   I would stand under it.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.920]   And I would open up a program that
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.120]   would sniff packets out of the air
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.000]   and record the signal strength at which they
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.240]   were receiving those packets.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.360]   And I would stand there and gather data.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.120]   And I would name the file with the name of the access point.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.440]   And then I'd walk down the hall to the next one.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.320]   And I would do that.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.880]   And then I'd walk down the hall to the next one.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.580]   And then I would do that.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.560]   I mean, it was the boringest possible work.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.840]   But you know what that gave us in the end?
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.720]   It was actually a pretty interesting data set
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.560]   where we could look at the signal
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.240]   strength of the beacons between different access points
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.360]   and try to figure out how those things varied
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.280]   based on the distance between those access points.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.160]   And ultimately, you're actually able to build
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.360]   an interesting model.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.720]   And a paper came out of that that
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.920]   was called the Mistaken Axioms of Wireless--
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   was it Wireless Network Research, which
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.800]   has been cited hundreds of times.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.920]   So it led to interesting places.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.460]   But the very first thing I was doing
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.680]   was literally the most boring thing you could do.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.600]   Walking and standing still at locations, pressing a button,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.120]   and then pressing that button again.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.480]   So it'll be boring at first.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.000]   But get involved with real projects.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.680]   That's where the cool stuff comes from.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
