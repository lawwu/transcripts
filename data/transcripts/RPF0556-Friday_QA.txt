[00:48:51.080 --> 00:49:00.040]   Well, that's sort of what needs a little more focus and direction.

[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.220]   Okay. How much is several thousand?
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.300]   I'd like to maintain at least one of the last project.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:13.460]   I'd like to maintain at least one of the last project. Let's call it 3,500.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:13.560]   Okay. 3,500. And how did you arrive at that number being the right number?
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:13.680]   Okay. 3,500. And how did you arrive at that number being the right number?
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:23.060]   Okay. 3,500. And how did you arrive at that number being the right number?
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:23.140]   Mainly because besides that, I can't think of any emergency besides, you know, a significant number.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:23.200]   Mainly because besides that, I can't think of any emergency besides, you know, a significant number.

[00:51:33.020 --> 00:52:02.840]   You know, a significant number. And I think that would require more than that. I think even if I were to lose my job, that would give me enough times, 3,500, to comfortably search for, let's say, a couple months.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   And I think that would require more than that. I think even if I were to lose my job, that would give me enough times, 3,500, to comfortably search for, let's say, a couple months.
