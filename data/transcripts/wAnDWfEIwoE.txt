[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.860]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.800]   My guest today is Josh Waitzkin.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.040]   Josh Waitzkin is a former child prodigy
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.840]   who began playing the game of chess at six years old.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.920]   And by the time he was 16 years old,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.680]   had become a national champion many times over,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.720]   as well as an international champion.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.640]   In fact, he achieved the level of international master,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.800]   which is one of the highest levels of achievement
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.880]   in the game of chess for anyone of any age.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.320]   His early life achievements were the topic and focus
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.360]   of the book and movie, "Searching for Bobby Fischer."
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.440]   He then quit playing the game of chess
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.240]   and moved on to martial arts,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.360]   the study of philosophy at Columbia University, New York,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.120]   and eventually foiling,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.680]   which is essentially surfing over the water.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.400]   Josh is not only a high performer,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.240]   he has now become perhaps
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.680]   the most sought after professional coach
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.880]   in the domains of finance,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.000]   in the domains of creative endeavors,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.080]   professional sports and military.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   Today's episode is one of my favorite
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.560]   Huberman Lab podcast episodes ever.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.680]   I know as a podcast host, you're not supposed to say that,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.760]   but it's absolutely true.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.360]   Because not only is Josh Waitzkin so highly accomplished,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.720]   but he is an exceptional teacher of the learning process.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   He took what he learned in chess and about learning chess
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.600]   and applied that to martial arts, to foiling, et cetera.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   And from participating in all those endeavors,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.760]   he was able to distill out the essential elements
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.920]   of learning and how to tailor one's learning process
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.280]   to one's own unique personality and style,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.800]   flaws and tendency to make mistakes,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.840]   and how to leverage all of that
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.960]   in order to be able to learn better.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.840]   In fact, throughout today's episode,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.440]   I promise that you will constantly be reflecting
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.920]   on where you experience things like tension and fear,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   both in your personal life, your professional life,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.640]   your educational life, whatever it is
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.840]   that you're trying to learn and pursue in life.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.240]   Today's conversation, thanks to Josh,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.720]   will allow you to look at that, understand it better,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.020]   and know where to apply work, when to relax,
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.440]   when to push forward, and in effect,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   how to become a better learner, both of yourself
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.480]   and whatever it is that you happen to be pursuing in life.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.840]   We have a saying in science,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.320]   which is that sometimes you encounter somebody
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.680]   who is truly N of one, meaning a sample size of one
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.500]   in a category all by themselves.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.200]   Josh Waitzkin is truly an N of one.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.860]   I know of no other person like him or even close to him
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.400]   in terms of his ability to live a unique life path
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.420]   and to take what he learns and to put it out into the world
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.860]   so that others may benefit.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.440]   He lives with a tremendous amount of intentionality
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.960]   for the people he loves, for the things he loves,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.240]   and with the intention of helping others
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.080]   learn how to learn better.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.600]   I must say it was a true honor to sit down with Josh.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.680]   I've been a huge fan of his work for a very long time.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.780]   You'll also learn that he's a really nice person.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.160]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.140]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.280]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.640]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.540]   this podcast episode does include sponsors.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.520]   And now for my discussion with Josh Waitzkin.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.440]   Josh Waitzkin, welcome.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   - Thank you, man, great to be here.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.640]   - I feel like I've known you a long time
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   because I saw the search for Bobby Fischer
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   and I learned about the real human that was about you.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   And I read "The Art of Learning,"
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.620]   and I must say I'm a fan and somewhat obsessed
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.280]   with the uniqueness of your arc and the choices you've made
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.680]   and your understanding of learning as a process
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.480]   and its universal properties,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.880]   its specific properties in different contexts.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.440]   So I'm excited to dive in.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.100]   I think for people that perhaps are not familiar with you,
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.360]   maybe you could just give us a broad overview
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.560]   of your backstory,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.120]   like the things that you've really focused on
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.700]   in kind of chunks, if you will,
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.680]   just for a couple of minutes
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   so that people can get familiar
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.400]   with the incredible things you've done.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.920]   And I think that reflects the uniqueness
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.120]   of your choice-making process, which then we'll get into.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.280]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.120]   Well, thank you, man.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.940]   It's an honor.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.780]   I appreciate what you said.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.860]   Yeah, so I started playing chess.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.380]   I grew up in New York City, downtown Manhattan.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.600]   I started playing chess when I was six years old.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.880]   And I discovered chess
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.940]   walking through Washington Square Park with my mom.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.960]   And I remember watching a day or two,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.560]   and then at one point I broke away from her.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.800]   I was going to play on the monkey bars,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.680]   and I ran over and I asked an old man if I could play.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.180]   And he said yes, and my mom was surprised.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.600]   And we started playing.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.320]   I played my first game of chess.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.780]   I remember the very distinct feeling of,
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.400]   it was as if I was discovering
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.080]   or rediscovering a lost memory.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.520]   It wasn't like I was learning something new.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.480]   It was like I was wiping away the dust
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.080]   or the cobwebs between something,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.580]   between me and something I had known very deeply at one point.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.680]   Very strange feeling for a six-year-old boy.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.040]   And then I just fell in love with the game.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.460]   I got really intensely into it.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.280]   My first teachers were the hustlers in Washington Square.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.680]   So it was just like a raucous crowd
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.160]   of guys who took me under their wings,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.500]   started teaching me the tactical street side of the game.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.240]   And I was just unhindered as a learner.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.980]   Which is interesting from my perspective now as a dad,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.680]   'cause my little boy Charlie is taking on surfing
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.240]   with that same kind of freedom.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.880]   Just that liberated, uncomplicated,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.280]   out of his own way kind of vibe.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.880]   Yeah, and then by the time I was seven,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.040]   I started competing and then I was a top-rated player
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.760]   from my age in the country.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.000]   Most of the years from age seven to 23,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.160]   my whole chess career.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.400]   So it was a very strange upbringing in some ways,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.840]   which has led to some quirky elements in my psychology,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.200]   which was that I was living in a pressure cooker
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.360]   of competition from age six on.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   And my whole childhood was spent as the target.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.560]   And so if you're competing in national championships,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.400]   I would compete in youth national and world championships,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.600]   then otherwise I'd be competing against adults,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.420]   everything else.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.800]   But then you're the target,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.440]   so any mistake you make,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.880]   and kids make mistakes all the time, we all do.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.600]   My rivals and their coaches who are strong masters
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.960]   and international masters and grandmasters
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.960]   would be able to study,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.840]   and adult strong players can see very easily
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.320]   the weaknesses in a child.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.700]   And so they would be prepared for them.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.120]   So if I didn't take on a weakness,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.800]   it would be exploited and I would experience pain.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   And so from a very young age,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.440]   not taking on my weaknesses was outside
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.280]   of my conceptual scheme.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.200]   Which is a really interesting thing to grow up with.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   And it's in many ways like lay the foundation
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.640]   for a lot of what I've done since.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.280]   And there are lots of things about that upbringing,
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.600]   which could be unhealthy.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.120]   - Being in the public eye.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.940]   - Yeah, so then--
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.780]   - Very bizarre.
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.440]   Luckily it was before social media.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.720]   - Yeah, super, yeah.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.640]   And I've never been on social media in any way,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.040]   which has been a choice.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.320]   So yeah, so when I was 11,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.480]   the book "Searching for Robby Fisher" came out.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.520]   And then when I was 15, the movie came out.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.000]   And at that point I was completely in love with chess.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.520]   It was my first love.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.960]   I was an unobstructed learner.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.520]   I loved competition.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.200]   A lot of my opponents were trying to control the game,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.760]   memorize openings, figure out how to win by force.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.600]   But I loved the battle.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.480]   My style was to create chaos,
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.040]   like in Washington Square Park.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.480]   Find hidden harmonies in chaos.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   And I loved that.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.200]   So as the game went on and they moved away
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.080]   from their opening preparation and controlling things,
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.960]   we moved into my power zone, which was the fight.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.440]   I loved the fight.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   And then my chess life in many ways was free flowing.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.720]   And then the movie came out when I was 15.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.200]   And then you can imagine what that was like
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   as a young teenager, all the attention,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.800]   the media, cameras everywhere, groupies,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.480]   all the temptations.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.840]   And I didn't ask for it.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.640]   And it was a really, it was an alienating period
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.520]   for me relative to chess.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.800]   And around the same time I started training
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.280]   with a Russian chess trainer who started urging me
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.000]   to move away from my self-expression as a chess player
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.480]   and to study the players who were the opposite of me.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.000]   I was a attacking player, aggressive.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.160]   I played kind of in the style, not at the level,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.560]   but in the style of like Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.000]   or Mikhail Tal, world champions who were like hot-blooded.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.160]   And I was being urged to study the more cold-blooded,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.680]   prophylactic side of chess, Petrosian, Karpov,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.960]   more conservative defensive players.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.760]   So I was being told, instead of saying like,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   what does Josh feel here?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.840]   What would Karpov play here, who's the opposite of me?
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.800]   And so the combination of that public eye
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.600]   and then the movement away from my self-expression
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.240]   led to a period of obstructedness and self-consciousness.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.600]   And an interesting theme we could talk about at one point
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.120]   is that passage from a pre-conscious
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   to a post-conscious competitor.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   In many ways, I went from like that freedom
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.840]   of pre-conscious competition
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.360]   into the tunnel of existential crisis.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.400]   And I grappled with it for a lot of years.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.160]   And when I was 18, when I graduated high school,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.800]   I, and during that grappling,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.660]   I was still the top-rated player in the country.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.160]   I was winning national championships every year.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.040]   So like from the outside, it looked good.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.760]   But from the inside, I was in turmoil.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.800]   I was fighting with myself.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.280]   I had all these demons.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.480]   And then I left the US.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.040]   I spent a number of years after high school
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.780]   studying East Asian philosophy, meditating, reflecting.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.440]   And then my study of chess in those years,
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.040]   and I was deeply in love with chess still,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   it became much more of an introspective process.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.920]   It became, I was competing as intensely as ever,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.480]   but chess became connected to life.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.280]   And then when I was 19 years old,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.800]   I started training at the Human Performance Institute.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.600]   At the time, it was called LGE,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   Lehrer, Groppel, and Echeverry.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.800]   It was a performance training,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.520]   cross-disciplinary performance training center
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.960]   that Jim Lehrer opened up.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.040]   And then it became the HBI later on.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.440]   And I'll never forget the moment
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.680]   that I was working with these performance psychologists,
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.640]   and I was at the gym,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.760]   and I was working with nutritionists,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.680]   and I was doing this intense workout,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.120]   and I looked next to me, and there was Jim Harbaugh,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.480]   who was the head coach at the time of,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.880]   who was the quarterback at the time of the Colts NFL team.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.000]   And we got into this amazing dialogue about performance.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.480]   And it was a real eye-opening moment for me,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.000]   'cause I realized that we spoke the same language.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.600]   It was like, holy shit, this guy's a,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.760]   he's an NFL quarterback, and I'm this crazy chess player,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.320]   but we're doing the same thing.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.800]   And it was this crystallization moment
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.240]   where I realized that all of these arts
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.720]   are fundamentally connected at the highest levels.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.500]   And what we're doing is much more similar.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.080]   Like if you're at the, like I observed that people
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.640]   who are at the pinnacles of different arts
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.200]   are often doing things that are much more similar
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.400]   than people who are in the same art from them,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.160]   but at lower levels.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.320]   There's something in that qualitative experience.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.200]   And then I began studying the principles
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.740]   that connected these things.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.060]   And then I had this interesting experience.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.720]   I'm gonna, I'm kind of compressing a life
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.600]   into a minute or two, but I,
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.400]   in my early 20s, when I ultimately moved away from chess,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.080]   and I'm happy to talk about why and that journey,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.320]   and then I moved into the martial arts.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.040]   My study of East Asian philosophy moved me
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.560]   into the study of Daoism and Tai Chi,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.240]   and then into Tai Chi push hands.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.320]   And I had this really interesting experience
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.680]   where at that point I'd been,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.720]   the introspective process of studying chess
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.920]   had become much more about studying life.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.040]   And so I was in an exploration of interconnectedness,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.000]   but I was not playing chess anymore,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.040]   and I was all in on the martial arts,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.160]   but I was giving a simultaneous chess exhibition,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.080]   which I did every year for many years,
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Research.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.560]   And I was playing 50 chess games at once,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.080]   and I was walking around this big square
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.600]   playing against 50 young, up-and-coming,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.240]   strong players at the same time.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.280]   And I realized at one point, I wasn't playing chess.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.040]   I was moving chess pieces,
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.460]   but I was thinking in Tai Chi language.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.360]   I was feeling flow, feeling space left behind,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.120]   riding energetic waves of the game.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.520]   And it was like, I was winning all these chess games,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.720]   but I hadn't played chess in a long time,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.080]   and I wasn't playing chess.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.400]   And it became like, and then my study of Tai Chi
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.680]   became extremely accelerated,
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.120]   and then I started winning, competing,
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.920]   and then I won in the fighting application,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.520]   and I started winning national championships.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.300]   And then I began to think about,
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.120]   or become more and more deeply involved in the study
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.860]   and the exploration of thematic interconnectedness,
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.640]   which has really become a life's work.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.400]   And then my martial arts life ended up
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.440]   taking me all over the world,
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.960]   and I won some world championships,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.040]   and then I moved into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.760]   and trained in that art for many years,
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.160]   and was training for the world championship
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.080]   for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.640]   This is after winning worlds in the Tai Chi Quan.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   And I broke my back in a training camp.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.720]   I own a school with Marcelo Garcia,
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.880]   who's a dear friend, who's a nine-time world champion,
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.760]   perhaps the greatest grappler, pound for pound, to ever live.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.680]   And I was training at a really high level,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.880]   and I was thinking about this,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.960]   like I was getting ready to begin my surge
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   toward black belt world championships in Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.180]   And I ruptured my L4, L5 disc.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.260]   And it was the first time I'd been moved away from an art,
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.620]   not on my own terms.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.720]   And it was a brutal injury that I ended up,
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   as we do when we're madmen,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   coming back and training for a year and a half
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.880]   with the broken, busted up back,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.000]   and then the doctors told me I had to let this one go,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.040]   or I'd be crippled for life.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.000]   And around that period is where I started
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.320]   to go all in on the art of training others.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.600]   And I said, okay, if I can't be all in training
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.840]   as a competitor, as an athlete myself,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.040]   I'd been training elite competitors
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.600]   in mental and physical performances for some time then,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.160]   but I wanted to take on the challenge
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.080]   of loving training others with the same intensity
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.840]   that I love training myself.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.600]   And I went all in on that art.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.360]   And I'm still all in on that art,
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.840]   but I never actually got to the place
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.400]   where I love not being in the arena myself
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   as much as being in the arena myself.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.000]   And then in this chapter of my life now,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.040]   I've fallen in love with the ocean arts,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.360]   initially surfing and now foiling.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.940]   And for the last eight years,
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.880]   I've been living in the jungles of Costa Rica with my family.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.840]   And I train three to five hours a day in foiling.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   And so I'm in my really intense training lifestyle myself,
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.080]   and I train elite mental and physical competitors
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.720]   around the world in finance, in science, technology,
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.640]   and in sports.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.360]   I've been doing some amazing work with the Boston Celtics
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.520]   for the last few years.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.160]   So that's the journey in a nutshell.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.680]   Happy to dig into any of it.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.000]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.320]   and thank one of our sponsors, Wealthfront.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.100]   I've been using Wealthfront for my savings
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.080]   and my investing for nearly a decade,
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.840]   and I absolutely love it.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.160]   Every January, I set new goals for the year.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.040]   And one of my goals for 2025 is to focus on saving money.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.160]   Since I have Wealthfront,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.800]   I'll keep that savings in my Wealthfront cash account
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   where I'm able to earn 4% annual percentage yield
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.480]   on my deposits, and you can as well.

[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Our Place.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.800]   Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.520]   Surprisingly, toxic compounds such as the PFASs
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.360]   or forever chemicals are still found
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.720]   in 80% of nonstick pans,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.320]   as well as utensils, appliances,
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.200]   and countless other kitchen products.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.940]   As I've discussed on this podcast,
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.800]   these PFASs or forever chemicals like Teflon
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.280]   have been linked to major health issues
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   such as endocrine disruption, gut microbiome disruption,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.920]   fertility issues, and many other health problems.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.040]   So it's really important to avoid them.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.580]   This is why I've recently fallen in love
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.160]   with Our Place products,
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.660]   especially one of their cooking pans,
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.880]   the Titanium Always Pan Pro.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.960]   Our Place products are made
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.520]   with the highest quality materials
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.080]   and are all PFAS and toxin-free.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.160]   They're beautifully designed and function extremely well.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.920]   As I mentioned, I love the Titanium Always Pan Pro
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.960]   from Our Place.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.560]   I cook eggs in it most mornings,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.640]   and the titanium pan is designed in a way
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.460]   that allows the eggs to cook perfectly
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.920]   without sticking to the pan.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.160]   I also cook burgers on it,
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.920]   and it really puts a nice sear on the burger
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.600]   without the meat sticking to the pan.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.980]   It's extremely easy to clean,
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.940]   and like all Our Place products,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.440]   it's nice to look at when sitting out
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.800]   on the counter or stove.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.640]   For a limited time,

[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.240]   We'll definitely revisit certain time points
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.880]   and themes there.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.080]   I can imagine as a young boy playing chess,
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.320]   you have your own strategies,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.080]   you're developing an understanding of what works for you,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.280]   but of course you, as a young kid,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.080]   are also getting into the mind of the other player.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.460]   You actually described that your coach or coaches
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.740]   were encouraging you to get into a different mindset,
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.960]   one that was not your default or trained-up mindset,
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.040]   less focused on chaos and aggression,
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.000]   and more in this other mode of playing
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   by thinking about these other types of chess players
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.240]   and ways to play chess.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   So I can imagine that most kids are not weaned,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.240]   their brain isn't developing around a game, right?
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   It seems that your brain was built,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.440]   the developmental neuroplasticity that's so robust
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.480]   in early childhood was built around this game
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.600]   that we call chess.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.080]   And it seems to me that you were encouraged
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   to develop a theory of mind
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.360]   that wasn't just your own,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   which is itself I think is really unique, right?
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.400]   I mean, most six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 12-year-olds
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.640]   might be told, "Hey, listen,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.940]   the reason they were mean to you at school
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.300]   is like they just hate themselves,"
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.960]   or, "They just didn't think about
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.840]   whether or not to pick you first or last for the game,"
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.920]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.120]   You know, that you get told to do that.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.160]   But for you, it became, it seems, an intense practice
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.520]   of trying to learn to get into the mind of another
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.680]   while holding on to your own sense
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.160]   of what's you versus them.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.300]   And so as a developmental neurobiologist,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.600]   I understand this is like perhaps
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.080]   one of the most important events
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.820]   in the development of our brain.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:30.760]   Seems that your brain was built up around that dynamic.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.440]   And so now you coach peak performers,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.840]   and so much of coaching and teaching or being a parent
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.200]   is to get into the mind of another.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.320]   The difference is when you're a parent,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.680]   you can think back to being a child
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.880]   and at least get some general sense of what that's like.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.280]   Stepping back from what I just said,
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.200]   and I realize that there's a lot of words there,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.500]   but do you think that what you're doing
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   when you approach a practice like Tai Chi
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.800]   or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or science or math or music
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.040]   from the perspective of a performer or a teacher
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.500]   is that you're getting into the mind of someone else,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:19.520]   or you're trying to stay in your own mindset?
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.400]   I'm sorry I'm not being more succinct with this,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.040]   but I think that as humans, we do this.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.360]   Like I'm sure our dogs look up at us and say,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.280]   oh, like they're happy with me or they're sad with me,
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.160]   but the algorithms they're running are more simplistic.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   I mean, we as the most sophisticated old world primates
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.680]   do this so spectacularly well.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.620]   And it seems that much of your career and your life
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.400]   has been built around these kinds of dynamics.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.920]   So put simply, what is your mindset
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.160]   when you approach a practice,
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.200]   that's just you in the practice
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.980]   versus your mindset when you approach a practice,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.700]   when it's you and another, a competitor,
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.320]   versus when you're trying to teach something,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.980]   you and a bunch of different minds,
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.360]   but there's a common goal.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.320]   Okay, so there's really three big questions wrapped in there
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.660]   and now-
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.600]   - There's sort of like 15 really big questions.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   - 15 really big questions.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.800]   And my audience gets upset at the length of these questions,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.840]   but I think for me, it's important to just kind of
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.360]   set this out there as a buffet
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.440]   from which you can select anything
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.280]   or discard anything that you like.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.400]   - There's some many delectable things to select there.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.500]   Yeah, so, I mean, first of all,
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.320]   one-on-one competition is so interesting
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.920]   in mental and physical arenas.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.960]   So if we think about Brazilian jiu-jitsu or chess
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.760]   as two of them, but let's zone in on chess
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.560]   'cause that's when I was a kid.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.600]   You're thinking about what your plan is
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.440]   and you're also thinking about
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.160]   what your opponent's plan is.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.920]   And you have to, every move your opponent makes,
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.000]   you have to think, why did he do that?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.840]   What's his plan?
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.480]   What is his tactical and what is his strategic plan,
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.560]   short-term and long-term?
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.440]   - So you're trying to unpack his strategy-
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.280]   - Always.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.880]   - And you're assuming that he has or she has a strategy.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.920]   - Well, if they don't have a strategy,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.400]   then they're not gonna be a good chess player.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.320]   And so then very quickly, if you're evolving in that art,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.720]   you're only playing against people who are at your level
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.560]   or better if you're growing.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.160]   If you're always playing down, then you're not improving.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.120]   And there's a beautiful filtration process
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.720]   in the people who accelerate in their growth curve
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   in the chess world are ones who are challenging themselves
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.880]   all the time, playing up, pushing their limits.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.560]   And so I spent my life against playing against
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.080]   strong players and I always played a little up,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.360]   except for when I was in youth competition,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   I always played up, which was important for me.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.000]   And so people had a plan and they were very deceptive
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.920]   about their plans and they had their layers to the plans.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.480]   There's like, there's the tactics they're trying to set up,
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.840]   there's their long-term strategy,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.400]   but then there's what they want me to think
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.600]   their strategy is, which it isn't.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.820]   And in fact, their strategy is to have misdirection
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.720]   around what their strategy and their tactics are
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.560]   and their layers to it.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.280]   And it can go many, many layers deep.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.040]   Same thing in the martial arts, right?
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.960]   So obviously you need to have a theory of mind
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.840]   to play that game, at least the way I played chess
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.960]   at a high level, because you're...
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.200]   And there's this very interesting shared consciousness
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.040]   between players.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.060]   You and I are sitting a little further apart
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.800]   than we would sit if we were playing chess.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.200]   So if we were like half the distance we are from one another
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.280]   and we're just sitting for six hours
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.840]   with like a three foot chess board,
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.520]   three feet between us, studying this thing,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.340]   our minds become connected.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.240]   We often will share the same illusion.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.920]   You might see something and then I see it when you see it.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.640]   If we have the same, we might have the same blind spot,
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.560]   we might have the same insight.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.760]   The connectedness of minds is fascinating.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.040]   And it's through chess, it's directly like energetic.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   It's through eye contact, it's through body language,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.240]   it's by seeing micro-expressions, it's everything.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.880]   So you're always reading the opponent.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.080]   And as you get really good, you learn
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.480]   like what your tells are, what your opponent's tells are.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.660]   Then you also learn, like I often would have tells
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.600]   on purpose and I'd have predictable tells
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.860]   that I would let people lean on for a long time
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.120]   until I didn't let them lean on it anymore.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.680]   It's like in the martial arts where you give someone
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.120]   comfort in a lean, right, and you give them a rep
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.680]   of something, they can lean on here, they can lean here.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.080]   Then they can lean here very comfortably,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.680]   five or six or eight or 10 times in a row
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   until they can't, then they're on the floor.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.300]   Right, so this is happening in chess,
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.480]   it's happening in all of these things.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.440]   And one-on-one competition is a relentless truth teller.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.800]   You know, if you have a weakness, it will be exposed.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.880]   If your opponent has a weakness, you will expose it.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.400]   If you go into a chess game and you've got
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.260]   huge opening repertoire that's extremely complex,
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.480]   but there's like one little place
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.880]   that I just hope he doesn't go there, he always goes there.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.720]   It's so bonkers.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   You can't hope your opponent's not gonna see it.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.480]   You can't make the second best move
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.940]   because maybe he'll blunder and I'll win.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.560]   That never works if you're playing as real competition.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.120]   And so, like you need to understand your mind,
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.680]   you need to understand your opponent's mind,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.720]   you need to understand your opponent's
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.280]   understanding of your mind, right?
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.320]   - That's a lot of plates to spin.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.700]   And I guess what I said before, not so clearly,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.240]   is that for a young mind to be able to learn
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.780]   to spin all those plates is incredible.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.140]   It's clearly possible.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.380]   It's unique, but it's possible.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.220]   You did that.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.020]   But it takes a young mind or an adult mind
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.100]   out of its own unique experience.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.540]   So this is eventually how we'll circle back
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.060]   to pre-consciousness versus post-consciousness.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.880]   But in the meantime, when was it that you first
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.560]   recall thinking not, "Oh, I'm gonna beat this guy,"
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.560]   but sensing he's getting nervous, or he's confident,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.600]   or he can sense that I'm nervous,
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   or I'm gonna set a trap, and just feeling out
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.680]   whether or not they detect the trap.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   I mean, it's just a lot.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.520]   - Right away, when I was, I mean, just to keep in mind,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.540]   my first teachers were hustlers,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.220]   were chess hustlers from Washington Square.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.900]   So they would mess with my mind all the time.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.140]   And then they would teach me what they were doing,
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.180]   and they would do it again at a higher level, right?
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.860]   So you're distracting, they're distracting,
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.740]   they're setting traps,
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.060]   they're using Jedi mind tricks of every sort.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.760]   - They didn't kid gobs you at all.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.060]   - I wouldn't say at all.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.980]   I mean, this was a rough and tumble crowd.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.180]   There were a lot of drugs in the park.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.180]   There was a lot of fights in the park.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.020]   I mean, these guys took me under their wing.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.220]   I mean, there were moments where some guy
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.280]   would be going off, and the guy would say,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.100]   "Hey, Josh is here, cut that out."
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.700]   Like they, I was their protege.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.980]   So they did, they did, but they also, you know,
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.340]   did not wear thick gloves.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.340]   And the gloves were thinning out all the time,
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.380]   and I was getting better fast.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.380]   Then we'd go to war.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.780]   They were my teachers, they were my friends.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.340]   I'm super grateful for like, and then,
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.340]   and then what's interesting is that
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.420]   my first classical chess teacher, Bruce Pendolfini,
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.120]   saw me playing in the park,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.420]   and asked my father if I could work with him.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.580]   And then we started training together.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.860]   And one of the things that I feel really badly about
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.540]   is the way he was portrayed in the film,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.420]   Searching for Bobby Fischer,
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.860]   'cause Bruce is still a dear friend of mine.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.620]   He's, Ben Kingsley played him
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.780]   as a much more severe person than he was.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.660]   He was a beautiful teacher.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.300]   And he really, he wanted me to express myself,
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.260]   as did the guys in the park.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.460]   But he was also filling in the holes,
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.100]   and teaching me a classical chess foundation.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.420]   And we were studying chess from the endgame first.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.340]   Principles, studying positions of reduced complexity
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.540]   to touch high-level principles,
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.580]   and then learning to apply them
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.820]   to more and more complex positions.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.940]   So my early chess education
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.100]   had both the classical study with Bruce,
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.220]   and it had the street-smart game
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.060]   with the hustlers at the park.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.460]   And, but to answer your question right away,
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.820]   when I was six years old,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.780]   like, my opponents would mess with my mind,
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.880]   and trap me, and trick me, and make me think here,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.720]   and then they'd go there,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.560]   and then I would learn to do that.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.020]   And then, I remember there was one youth competition
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.180]   where I made a move inside a trap and went, "Oh!"
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.900]   I mean, it was like that obvious, right?
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.260]   Like, it's like the worst.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.100]   Like, and then it gets increasingly subtle, right?
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.220]   But like, and my opponent said,
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.460]   "Oh, he's unhappy, he took the pawn."
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.060]   Then you, and then your opponents see it,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.940]   and then you learn, you know,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.860]   those things just keep on,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.220]   the circles get smaller, and smaller,
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.100]   and tighter, and tighter, and more, and more refined.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.920]   - This is the opposite of Asperger's or autism, by the way.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.460]   What you're describing is a hypertrophy set of circuits
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.820]   for theory of mind in a very young kid.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.060]   So to be able to understand what's happening around you.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.780]   And I think for many people,
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.980]   the joys of childhood are really about
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.660]   not being aware of what's going on around you.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.820]   The psychologists would refer to the,
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.140]   this is like a lack of impingement.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.740]   Impingement is when like a kid is playing,
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.940]   and they're really enjoying something,
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.940]   and then suddenly they decide
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.460]   they don't wanna play anymore,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.220]   and the parent doesn't wanna be bothered.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.700]   So they say, "No, no, no, no, like keep playing."
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.620]   You know, they're like impinging on the kid's
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.140]   reflexive desire to do something or not do something.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.320]   This isn't about keeping them safe,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.080]   this is in the domain of safety.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   But at least within the channel of chess,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.340]   it seems that you developed your entire understanding
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.220]   of the psychology of human beings,
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.820]   except for, of course, you had an experience
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.740]   at a home of family and friends.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.860]   But chess certainly cut a wide trough
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.300]   through your development.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.740]   - Well, I'm really grateful for my early chess life.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.700]   And I also would never choose to put that on my children.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.020]   I mean, it worked out really well for me.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.140]   I mean, I have my wounds, right?
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.500]   I mean, there's lots of things that I've had to grapple with.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.940]   But I think if you put a lot of children
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.140]   through the pressures that I went through,
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.420]   it wouldn't work out well.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.780]   And I watched a lot of my young,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.940]   I mean, almost all my young rivals,
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.460]   or I mean, like very close to all of my young rivals
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.020]   ended up quitting and falling into crisis.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.820]   And, you know, then you have parents and coaches
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.460]   who are expressing their own egoic needs
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.580]   through the children, and the children are shouldering that,
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.180]   and then that becomes very difficult to deal with.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.860]   And then you're dealing with heartbreak,
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.420]   and you're putting everything on the line,
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.260]   and you're losing,
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.660]   and you're dealing with your own self-doubts,
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.860]   and the heartbreak of your mother, and your father,
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.940]   and your coach, and then your friends.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.020]   I mean, there are so many,
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.020]   and then as the pressures get more and more intense in chess,
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.460]   like you really are putting your heart and soul on the line
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.020]   through that chess board, in casual games,
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.540]   let alone in national and world championships.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.120]   And you're being shattered when you lose.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.580]   I was shattered many times over.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.620]   I mean, I lost last rounds of national chess championships,
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.940]   and world championships, multiple times over.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.940]   And those were the greatest moments of my life
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.780]   in retrospect.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.940]   They taught me the most important lessons of my life.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.160]   I would never take it back.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.500]   It's been, and that's a pattern in my chess life,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.940]   in my fight life, and everything I've gone through.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.580]   The most heartbreaking, devastating moments
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.440]   ultimately were the ones that catalyzed the most growth.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.640]   And they were beautiful.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.820]   And I really relate to them that way.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.060]   But they also can be brutal for young minds,
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.380]   and they can destroy people.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.300]   - Yeah, what do you think it is about failure
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.900]   or missing the mark in some way that catalyzes change?
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.100]   I mean, I always say that, you know,
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.860]   your brain has no reason to change
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.100]   if you're just trying to learn something,
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.900]   and you're in flow, you're getting, you know,
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.940]   most people associate being quote-unquote in flow
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.100]   with getting everything correct, doing everything correctly.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.660]   I don't think that was the original definition
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.680]   that Csikszentmihalyi intended, but the neuroscience
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.740]   of brain plasticity tells us that it's only
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.420]   under conditions in which there's some mismatch
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.260]   between what you're trying to do, like even, you know,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.940]   like this has been studied in terms of reaching
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.060]   for an object and there's a mirror displacement
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.940]   or a prism displacement or something,
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.180]   you eventually can learn to error correct
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.020]   because the cup is actually over there
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.580]   as opposed to where you see it.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.740]   But it is the deployment of these chemicals inside of us,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.020]   adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine in particular,
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.380]   those three, they're cousins, the catecholamines
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.120]   that tells the, at a neurochemical level,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.280]   tells the synapses, wait, something needs to change.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.420]   I mean, the brain doesn't have any reason to change
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.140]   unless there's frustration, agitation,
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.460]   or at least some neurochemical change associated
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.960]   with those things that we call frustration and agitation.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.420]   So do you think these big,
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.420]   what feel like cataclysmic fails set a sort of window
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.740]   of plasticity in which we can change?
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.420]   I often didn't think that,
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.380]   that it's only through like the devastation of a huge loss
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.880]   that the brain is now set up for a bunch of new learning.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.220]   Certainly we wouldn't want to design the system that way,
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.740]   but as I always joke, you know,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.860]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.140]   and you weren't either.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.580]   We just had to work with what's there.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.540]   Like big failure.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.740]   Why do you think that sets a wave front of change?
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.520]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.780]   Well, I think the study you sent me yesterday
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.620]   speaks to this.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.820]   - Yeah, maybe we should talk about that.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.580]   - Yeah, maybe I'll answer that question experientially.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.020]   Maybe you could then talk about the study
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.360]   and we can riff on it a little bit.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.260]   This is so much fun, by the way,
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.100]   'cause I've lived my life in the arena,
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.140]   just like pushing myself.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.700]   Like I'm my own, I'm not a scientist,
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.100]   but I'm like my own laboratory.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.700]   You said to me yesterday at the game, like-
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.860]   - You said, I'm not a scientist,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.060]   but I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.340]   And I said, trust me, you're a scientist.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.440]   You know, I do science through the lens
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.420]   of a certain understanding of mechanism
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.880]   and structure function and some processes.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.740]   And you do science through the lens of experience
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.740]   and drawing core parallels and principles
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.360]   in different domains and at different levels
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.380]   from unskilled all the way up to virtuosity.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.760]   That's kind of how I see it.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.060]   - I think the way that I,
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.500]   like if I think about the most painful losses of my life,
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.100]   the most devastating injuries of my life,
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.260]   I think about dying, drowning.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.180]   I drowned in the bottom of doing hypoxic breath work
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.020]   in a pool.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.900]   I was on the bottom of the pool four and a half minutes
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.940]   after that, it led to the arguably the best decision
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.700]   of my life to move into the jungle.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.640]   I think about the losing the last round
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.640]   of the under 18 world chess championship on the first board.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.980]   That's a very interesting story I could describe
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.140]   a little bit.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.820]   Or I think about like my first national championship
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.820]   I lost when I was seven, eight, first board,
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.340]   last round, just unobstructed learning until then.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.340]   And then I lost the last round for the title,
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.900]   fell into an opening trap.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.500]   Like that's the loss that was the greatest thing
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.620]   that ever happened to me.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.460]   - You were how old?
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.860]   - I think I'd just turned eight or I was late seven.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.780]   And like that was, 'cause if I had won that game,
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.940]   I easily could have associated winning with just no pain,
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.300]   no heart, just cruising up until then.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.860]   That was the moment that like I got my ass kicked.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.620]   I had to go back, deal with these demons,
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.980]   come back, train for the next year,
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.900]   and then I won the next year.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.260]   And then it was off to the races.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.460]   My life might look very different if I'd won that game.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.380]   And actually the kid who beat me in that game,
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.780]   David Arnett, became, two years later,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.020]   we became best friends.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.640]   For all of our childhood, we were on the same chess team
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.480]   and best friends.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.380]   And I think he gave me the greatest gift
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.380]   of my competitive life by kicking my ass that game.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:58.380]   The most devastating loss of my chess life was,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.740]   so I was 17 years old.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.260]   I was competing in the World Under 18 Chess Championship
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.300]   in Szeged, Hungary.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.940]   Every, so every year there's an Under 12, 14, 16, 18, 21
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.780]   World Championship.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.740]   And I was always representing the US
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.900]   in those tournaments around the world.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.900]   And I traveled to India or Brazil or Hungary
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.420]   or Germany or somewhere and compete
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.660]   in the World Championship.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:26.660]   And Under 18 Worlds, I played the tournament.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.820]   I just was playing very inspired chess.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.460]   I had just picked up On the Road three weeks before,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.300]   Jack Kerouac.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.740]   I had become, I was just on fire with Kerouac's vision.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.760]   And I was just so like appreciating life
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.140]   with a freshness and intensity than I'd ever had,
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.020]   more than I'd ever had.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.940]   I was like totally on fire.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.100]   In chess, in life, in love, in everything.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   And I, I was paired against Peter Svidler,
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.860]   who was the Russian.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.700]   We were on the first board last round.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.860]   We were playing for the World Championship.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.340]   Every country sends their national champion,
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.300]   so it's a long tournament to get there.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.780]   Early in the game, I think it was move 12,
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.820]   he offered me a draw.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.700]   So if I'd accepted the draw offer,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.860]   it would have been the tie breaks.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.380]   I didn't know exactly what was happening,
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.660]   but I thought that he was slightly favored in tie breaks.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.940]   I wasn't sure, but basically the World Championship
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.180]   would be determined, or the gold medal would be determined
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.060]   by how our opponents in previous rounds
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.260]   did in the last round.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.340]   But I hadn't calculated it out before,
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.140]   but I had a feeling it was like,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.620]   maybe it was like 40-60 or 30-70 against me.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.560]   But it was my style.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.660]   I never accepted draw offers.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.500]   That wasn't my style.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.620]   I always wanted to fight.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.220]   So I declined, pushed for a win.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.260]   Now the beauty of his decision was also
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.280]   he offered me a draw in the critical position
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.580]   where I had to make a very specific decision,
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.480]   which is a trick that chess players play on one another,
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.340]   which is that like if you're,
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.300]   we should talk about tension at one point.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.100]   It's a really beautiful theme to explore
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.380]   in different sports.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.960]   So one thing that happens in chess games
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.140]   is that you have this building tension between minds,
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.860]   and often the tension on the chess board
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.320]   and the tension on the minds are mounting together.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.520]   And the urge, the need to release psychological tension
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.040]   often leads to the decision to release chess tension
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.140]   in the chess pieces.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.100]   And when you release chess tension,
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.700]   usually the person who releases the tension
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.860]   will be on the wrong side of tactics.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.220]   So a lot of chess, a chess game
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.860]   is about putting mental pressure on the opponent
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.340]   to force them to break the tension on the chess board.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.700]   So in that game, he offered me a draw.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.940]   So you think about it, we're 17 years old.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.560]   We're 10 days into a world championship battle.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.420]   We, even no matter how much we love the battle,
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.500]   some piece of ourselves wants a way out.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.380]   Like we want to release the tension, right?
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.900]   It's just elemental to who we are
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.660]   when we're living with that much pressure.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.700]   So all I have to do then is like accept the draw,
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.280]   shake hands, and the tournament's over,
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.420]   and then it's out of our hands what happens.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.260]   So in that moment,
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.980]   I have to also make a critical chess position.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.140]   So the urge to release the tension
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.340]   is subtly entering into my chess decision.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.760]   And in that move, I declined the draw,
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.980]   and I made a slightly overaggressive move,
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.840]   which turned, and he ended up playing a beautiful game,
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.860]   big attack, beating me.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.700]   I lose the world championship,
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.540]   just this close to like your dream.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.940]   You're shattered, right?
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.180]   I then went and hitchhiked across Eastern Europe
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.800]   to meet my girlfriend at the time
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.140]   in a little town in Slovenia,
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.700]   and then we broke up and all that.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.340]   Ended up meeting again in a street corner in Brazil,
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.820]   the world under 21 championship three weeks later.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.300]   Lots of drama, you know, being a 17 year old kid.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:41.300]   I didn't study that chess loss for two and a half months.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.740]   It was so painful to me.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.340]   I always studied games immediately afterwards.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.820]   You might study a chess game
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.980]   for anywhere between three and 15 hours,
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.220]   studying one chess game.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   And that, say 10 hours,
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.420]   is focused on the two or three critical positions
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.500]   of the game.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.220]   And this was before chess computers were rampant,
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.060]   and you had chess engines
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.140]   that could always just tell you the answer to the move.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.860]   That's also something we should talk about later,
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.780]   how chess engines and AI chess engines
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.660]   change the nature of who chess players are
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.120]   because you can have the answer right away
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.780]   versus having to sit in cognitive and emotional dissonance
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.820]   for sometimes weeks or months at a time
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.060]   without knowing the answer.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.440]   But we'll come back to that maybe.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.100]   So I didn't study that loss for two and a half months
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.380]   'cause it was so painful to me.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.980]   Then I was, my family spent a lot of time at sea,
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.740]   which was an interesting part of my life and my chess life,
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.640]   living on a little boat, catching our own food,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.940]   doing our own engine work.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.980]   And I was at sea after competing
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.060]   in both of those world championships and some other things.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.560]   And I sat down to study that game.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.600]   And I spent a dozen plus hours
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.560]   studying that one critical position of the game.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.580]   And then I realized what the,
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.900]   like the move I should have made
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.520]   was outside of my conceptual scheme
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.440]   in that critical position.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.000]   I wasn't ready to make the move I had to make.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.840]   And he was also, I think,
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.440]   a slightly stronger chess player than me.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.480]   I was a great fighter.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.560]   I loved the battle.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.600]   But I think if objectively, he was a better,
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.560]   his name is Peter Svidler.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.200]   He ended up becoming a world-class grandmaster
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.680]   and is just an incredible chess player today.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.700]   At the time, he was just amazingly brilliant,
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.040]   beautiful, fluid mind.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   But I was confident going into the game.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.520]   So I had to make this move
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.340]   that would essentially be,
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.440]   his attack was on the king's side,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.040]   my expansion was on the queen's side.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.240]   I had to remove my final defensive piece
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.880]   from in front of my king, away from my king's side,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.000]   which is super counterintuitive
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.140]   'cause you think you want it to defend your king.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.280]   What I didn't realize is like
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.080]   harnessing the power of empty space against aggression.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.040]   His attack needed my defense,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.120]   like fire needs fuel to burn.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.560]   Moving my last defensive piece,
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.520]   his attack couldn't break through.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   But that principle was something
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.700]   I didn't understand at all.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.160]   And so it's not like I would have found that move,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.240]   but it was a real pop in my mind, right?
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.800]   So then I was 17, 18 years old.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.560]   And then a year later, I started studying Tai Chi.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.200]   So I was studying Taoist meditation,
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.360]   Taoist philosophy, the Tao Te Ching,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.520]   Chuang Tzu, Lao Tzu, the inner chapters.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.560]   And then I get into Tai Chi.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   I started moving meditation,
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.720]   and I started in Tai Chi Chuan, push hands.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.760]   Without making the connection,
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.320]   push hands is the martial art,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.760]   which is like the essence of push hands
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.380]   is learning to utilize empty space against aggression.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.160]   But I hadn't connected it to that moment.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.520]   Then you fast forward to 2004 World Championship,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.240]   which is what the art of learning ended with,
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.920]   the final chapter of that is the World Championship finals.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.480]   I'm fighting this guy bigger than me,
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.080]   stronger than me, he's been training since childhood.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.880]   Final fight in a big stadium,
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.080]   everyone wanting me to destroy it
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.200]   in the biggest fight of my life.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.680]   And I won that fight by harnessing the power of empty space,
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.080]   by letting him feel my weakness,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.480]   by leaning on him, and then disappearing.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.640]   So it's very interesting how there was no mental process,
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.020]   there's no conscious processing of that connection.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.760]   But the biggest loss of my chess life,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.620]   and then the principle,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.620]   which I wasn't ready to understand yet,
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.480]   was how I won the World Championship in the martial arts
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.760]   so many years later.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.600]   And it's a completely different discipline, right?
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.820]   So it's an example of like,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.320]   and of course that principle is manifest
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.880]   in every part of my life today.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.860]   But that's one of many stories in my life
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.040]   where like a loss spurs an insight
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   which might consciously or often unconsciously
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.020]   lead to something incredible down the road.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.320]   And I think that one of the biggest challenges
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.160]   that we have,
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.320]   but it's so interesting that the loss
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   of a World Chess Championship final leads to the win,
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.560]   direct lesson leads to the win of a World Championship
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.140]   in the fighting realm.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.920]   And how common that is.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.980]   And one of the things that I think about,
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.760]   like when you sit down with great competitors,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.840]   again and again, when you hear their inner journey,
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.080]   the most heartbreaking losses
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.680]   lead to the transformational change
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.060]   which leads to the biggest wins of their life.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.580]   Whether it's in basketball,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.500]   whether it's in fighting,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.460]   whether it's in business, it's in finance,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.560]   it's in writing.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.880]   - Love. - In love.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.000]   Oh my God, in love, yeah.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.400]   - I mean, breakups are devastating.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   They're a death of sorts.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.600]   - Yeah.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.840]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.480]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.040]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.160]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.600]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.660]   all of your foundational nutritional needs
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.800]   and it tastes great.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.560]   Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.000]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.480]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.340]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.680]   to purchase one supplement
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.720]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.120]   The reason for that is even though I strive to eat
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.800]   most of my foods from whole foods
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.600]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.320]   vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.520]   micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.400]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.220]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.660]   I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.160]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.840]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.420]   my physical health, my mental health and my performance,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.640]   both cognitive and physical are better.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.200]   I know that because I've had lapses
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.440]   when I didn't take AG1
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.300]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.320]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.400]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.920]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.340]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning,
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.480]   and again, later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.600]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.080]   If you'd like to try AG1,

[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.880]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.720]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.280]   that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.620]   it's the incredible impact
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.940]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.280]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.900]   red light and near infrared light
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.700]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.660]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.340]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.420]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.180]   improvements in acne, meaning reductions in acne,
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.620]   reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.960]   improved mitochondrial function,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.580]   and even improving visual function itself.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.920]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.100]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.340]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.660]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.120]   and near infrared light in specific combinations
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.780]   to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.660]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.320]   about three to four times per week,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.700]   typically in the morning, but sometimes in the afternoon.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.580]   And I use the Juve handheld light
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.620]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.760]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.020]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.940]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.260]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.340]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:17.340]   Again, that's juve, J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.980]   to get up to $400 off.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:24.820]   I have a friend who's a trauma therapist, addiction expert,
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.940]   and occasionally you'll hear these tragedies of,
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.900]   typically it's young guys who the girlfriend
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.100]   breaks up with them and they commit suicide.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.260]   And for years, he would work with families of these people,
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.740]   these young guys, and he finally connected the dots
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.720]   and he realized that in every case,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.220]   it was as if there was no future whatsoever
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.740]   because it was their first relationship.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.340]   And when you hear it, you just go,
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.780]   "Oh, it makes so much sense."
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.460]   But the 16-year-old and the 18-year-old brain,
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.720]   however old these kids were, it's devastating.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.500]   I wanna make sure that I ask about devastation
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.360]   because you said that you were devastated.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.740]   You experienced a tremendous amount of pain
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.900]   from these losses,
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.540]   in particular the one that you just described.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.540]   If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.060]   about what that was like.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.040]   I don't wanna spin off into a discussion
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.360]   about the science of grief,
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.520]   but I did an episode about grief
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.440]   and it was really surprising to learn
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.260]   that most of what you hear about in pop culture,
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.920]   that there are these very specific stages of grief
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.600]   and you progress through them linearly.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.720]   None of that is true.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.000]   All of modern research says
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.800]   that it's not disbelief, anger, acceptance.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.760]   It's like a hodgepodge of different emotions
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.260]   depending on time of day and middle of the night.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.480]   But the core feature, and I find this so interesting,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.920]   is that grief, whether or not it's what I would consider
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.640]   kind of trivial grief, like losing your favorite pen
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.440]   or a watch that you really love, okay,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.720]   an object versus somebody extremely close to you,
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.080]   a parent, a loved one, a child, God forbid,
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.080]   that the brain systems that map memory onto action
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:06.000]   are disrupted in grief such that you wake up each day
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.080]   and you wanna go see the person or call them.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.360]   And so what grief really represents
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.160]   is a remapping of your understanding
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.800]   about what you can do with your physical body
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.920]   to create action and interaction
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.120]   with this person that's now gone.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.760]   And so the remapping is one of the nervous system
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.160]   having to do all this no-go.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.920]   We talk in terms of inaction systems
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.160]   and the basal ganglia of the brain.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.900]   You have go programs and no-go programs.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.200]   There's some other stuff too, but it's mostly go or no-go.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.860]   And basically grief is this taking of a,
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.080]   depending on how long and how deeply you knew the person,
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.360]   a tremendous amount of neural real estate and algorithms
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.240]   that were all go.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.680]   You could text them, you could call them,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.180]   you could hug them, you could kiss them,
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.800]   you could listen to them, you could smell them.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.480]   And now it's all no-go.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.680]   And that we think is what we experience as grief.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.900]   Now, in terms of losing a very important chess match,
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.160]   when you talk about being in pain and in grief,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.960]   what was that like?
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.200]   Did that mean sleepless nights, disbelief?
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.240]   And at what point do you think you were able to say,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.080]   okay, you know what?
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.720]   I'm gonna start thinking about this constructively.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.480]   I'm gonna turn this into a go
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.720]   as opposed to just trying to get in your time machine
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.160]   and travel back in time, which of course is impossible.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.400]   What was that early experience of devastation like
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.420]   and how did it transmute into growth?
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.320]   - Yeah.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.880]   Well, even sitting with you now thinking about it,
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:37.000]   it seems ridiculous for a chess game to be,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.860]   losing a chess game to be anywhere near
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.240]   like the absolute heartbreak of losing a loved one.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.280]   And yet we can make things very large in our minds
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.900]   and in our beings, right?
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.520]   I think that human, I mean, one thing I think about
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.240]   is how hard we fight to maintain our conceptual schemes,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.960]   our identities, even if they're torturing us.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.840]   - And loss isn't relative.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.000]   You know, I mean, the fact that we're sitting right now
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   not far from, you know, hundreds, if not thousands of homes
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.480]   that have been wiped away, doesn't change other losses.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.640]   Like we sometimes will say, well, at least we're, you know,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.520]   I know I have a lot of friends that lost their homes.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.720]   They'll say, well, at least we have our health.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.840]   We have our things, you know, okay.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   And so we can do this, but it's not
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.240]   how the human emotion system responds reflexively
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.320]   to our own losses.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.000]   So I don't think it's like dismissive
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   or sociopathic to experience a big loss in one's life
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.520]   as a big loss, even if it's not the worst possible loss.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.240]   It's just not how we're wired.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.080]   - Right, and one of the things that I reflect on
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.360]   and that I've cultivated, it's very hard,
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.240]   but that I work to cultivate is when you're
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   in those moments of rupture, to both be in the rupture
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.120]   and have the perspective that we will have later
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.040]   about the rupture, which is not to say
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.760]   not being in the rupture.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.720]   One of the things I feel badly about in,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.200]   like when I wrote "The Art of Learning,"
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.120]   I spoke a lot about process and outcome,
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.800]   and it had a big impact in the chess world.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.400]   And then what happened is there were generations
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.680]   of parents who had young kid chess players
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.640]   who their kids would go to compete,
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.160]   and the parents would say, it doesn't matter
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.880]   if you win or lose, all that matters is the process.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.800]   It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.000]   And the kids are like putting on their armor
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.120]   to go to battle, mental battle.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.760]   And chess is fucking intense.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.360]   Like when you're playing chess, you're putting your mind,
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.680]   your body, your psyche, everything on the line.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.760]   And if you lose, you feel shattered.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.560]   Like that's just how you feel.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.240]   If you're not trying your hardest,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.080]   then we shouldn't even be talking about you.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.600]   So let's say you are trying your hardest.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.280]   You're putting it all on the line.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   It's on the line, and you lose and you're shattered.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.580]   Like every part of you, you feel destroyed.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.300]   So the kids are putting on their armor to go to battle,
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.140]   and the parent tells them,
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:00.960]   it doesn't matter if I win or lose.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.800]   It's deeply confusing.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.600]   And the kids actually usually know
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.700]   that the parents are full of shit.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.600]   The parents actually care so much,
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.400]   and they feel guilty about how much they care
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.240]   about their kid's result.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.040]   They're telling their kid that to feel less guilty
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.120]   about the fact that they're putting their own egoic needs
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:13.960]   on their child.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.360]   And it's all like, and the kids see it all.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.240]   That's the hilarious thing.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.800]   It's like an eight, 10, 11 year old.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.640]   Like they see it all.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.840]   They're like, mom, give me a break.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.760]   And the parents are just stuck in their guilt and absurdity.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.120]   Seen this so many times.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.000]   So like the discussion of process and outcome
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.160]   is so subtle, right?
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.560]   Because yes, it's about the process.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.400]   It's about the journey.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.640]   It's about the long-term process.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.440]   But if we don't care about the results,
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.320]   the process won't work.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.440]   So we need to put ourselves on the line
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.920]   enough to be shattered,
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   and the process is what really matters.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.560]   But it's not that we can liberate ourselves
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.640]   from caring enough to be shattered,
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.320]   because then we're not engaged.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.200]   And it is something about putting our egos on the line
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.280]   that is what leads to the growth surges
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.880]   that great competitors have,
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.400]   the ones who become virtuosos, right?
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.280]   And so then that stated,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.120]   how can we experience the simultaneity of being shattered
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.920]   and having the perspective that this is probably
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.080]   the greatest thing that ever happened to me?
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.640]   - Well, you have to be in a mode of theory of mind
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.040]   with yourself about your future self somehow.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.120]   And this is what I think losses are so beneficial for,
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.020]   is that if you've had a couple of breakups,
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.920]   you realize that you can fall in love again.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.160]   If you've only had breakups,
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.160]   perhaps you think, well, it always leads to a breakup,
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.680]   but you know that the process of moving forward
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.360]   is the only way to test that hypothesis again.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   And so I think repeated failure is essential, right?
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.520]   Because with repeated failure means that
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.520]   there was also repeated fighting one ways back after failure.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.780]   So, yeah, I think sometimes,
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.720]   not to take us into a different course of story,
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.440]   but just very briefly,
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.220]   the first manuscript I ever submitted in graduate school
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.740]   took forever to get published.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.160]   And it went from the highest of journals
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.040]   down to a good journal, solid journal,
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.640]   but it took forever.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.400]   And that was so beneficial.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.280]   I was crushing at the time,
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.560]   but my reward circuitry is built up
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.560]   around very long latency between effort and final outcome.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.720]   I'm just used to long waits
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.240]   between figuring out what's gonna happen.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.140]   And actually one of the weirdest things about podcasting
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.920]   or social media is that I feel like
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   you go to quote unquote to publication so fast.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.720]   It's like, whoa, like things used to,
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.800]   projects used to take two years
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.060]   and then you get reviews and then this, you know.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:51.060]   So I think your early devastating failure or failures,
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.560]   'cause you had a few of them in there.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.160]   - Oh, a lot more than a few.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.000]   - Probably set you up
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.280]   for tremendous frustration tolerance.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.520]   And this, not just hearing,
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.080]   I mean, the words this too shall pass, they're helpful,
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.960]   but that's really something
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.600]   that needs to be experienced in my view.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.880]   - It's a very interesting thing
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.240]   when you're talking about competitors,
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.160]   what is the right balance between
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.760]   playing up and playing down, right?
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.440]   Like how much do you want to build the confidence
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.840]   of a young competitor or artist or person
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.760]   or any of us young, whatever age,
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.440]   when how much do you want to be stretched
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.200]   a little bit beyond your ability
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.440]   so that your weaknesses are exposed,
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.680]   you have to take them on and you have to grow.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.160]   And getting that balance right is hugely important.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.920]   And it's not simple.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.520]   Like a lot of boxing training camps
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.240]   are based around the boxer's confidence being everything.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.120]   And you want them to feel invincible going into the ring.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.320]   Right, and then from another perspective,
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   it's something very powerful
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.160]   about having a training camp that's so intense
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.840]   that all your weaknesses are exposed,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.680]   you have to take them on.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.240]   If you're not sparring against people
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.320]   who can expose your weaknesses,
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.720]   then you don't know what they are.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.200]   You don't have the chance to grow, right?
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.240]   I mean, I live at this point
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.240]   with a trying to be at max stretch without snapping, right?
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.640]   Like, for example, if I look at my foiling,
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.360]   like if I'm not falling enough during a foil session,
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.460]   then I'm not pushing my turns hard enough.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:21.120]   And if I'm, yeah, if you're just succeeding all the time,
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.360]   then you're not pushing yourself enough.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.600]   - Do you believe in optimal levels of arousal
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.520]   for different aspects of practice or game?
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.760]   Autonomic arousal is something
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.440]   that I've worked on for many years.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.320]   And one of the most impressive features,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.720]   I think, of our brains as humans.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.800]   First would be our ability to think into the past,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.520]   present, or future, or combination of those two.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.800]   If other animals do that, they don't do it nearly as well.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.480]   And they certainly don't create technologies
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.680]   to bridge those different time scales.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.520]   That's number one.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.860]   But the other one is our visual
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.880]   and temporal aperture of focus.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.440]   So when we are in a state of elevated arousal,
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.120]   our visual aperture shrinks,
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.800]   I'm sure you're familiar with this,
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.560]   and we slice time more finely.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.200]   Much, you know, it's like a higher frame rate,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.680]   which is why people who, for instance,
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.080]   see a devastating traumatic car crash
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.760]   report experiencing things in slow motion, right?
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.600]   'Cause their frame rate is high, like a slow motion video.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.360]   Whereas when we are relaxed,
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.720]   our frame rate is larger bins of time.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.740]   And I feel like so much of the discussion
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:36.560]   around things like flow and optimal states for learning
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.700]   have to do with assuming
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.800]   that there's one optimal state of arousal.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.800]   But I feel like in every endeavor I've ever been involved in
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.960]   it's about learning the transitions
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.040]   between the arousal states
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.360]   that allows us to pull back a little bit as things,
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.340]   as you said, like get tense, just relax just a little bit
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.280]   to be able to maybe see a different perspective
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   or ratchet up our level of tension or AKA arousal
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.960]   in order to be able to find slice the, you know,
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.140]   the micro expressions of a competitor.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:16.300]   I mean, these two cameras on the fronts of our skull
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.920]   and the rest of our brain are really devoted
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.840]   to this process of, you know,
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.120]   shrinking or expanding the aperture of our consciousness.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.080]   And it can be talked about in terms of space,
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.920]   just vision like tunnel vision versus panoramic vision.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.440]   It can be talked about as space time, you know,
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.320]   tunnel vision, fine slice, panoramic vision, broader slice.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.360]   But then when you start getting into like the,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.520]   then you map that onto the past, present and future mapping.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   And that's where I feel like we're into the game
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.520]   of skill learning and chess and strategy.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.280]   So forgive me for the kind of, you know,
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.320]   top contour neuroscience description,
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:57.320]   but that's how I see the human primate as so different
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.800]   than all the other creatures in the world.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.180]   That's how we're different
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.480]   because we can learn chess or ballet, foil.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.000]   You know, Gibbons are pretty amazing at what Gibbons do,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.360]   but if they're trying to learn other stuff
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.280]   that they've been failing so far.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.140]   I spent a lot of time playing with frame rates
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.640]   and I had this experience that I wrote about
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.040]   that slowing down time chapter of the art of learning
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.280]   where I, when I had these experiences
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.320]   both in chess and in fighting,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.200]   it was one time I was fighting against a super heavyweight
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.600]   dude in a competition and my hand shattered.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.440]   And like I broke my hand right here.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:42.340]   And it was interesting 'cause the fight was very intense,
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.080]   reasonably hard and my hand broke
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.000]   and instantly time slowed down.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.040]   And he was moving in slow motion
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.640]   and I was able to just so easily play with someone
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.160]   with like a broken hand
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.880]   compared to what had been a war before.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.920]   - We know what that is.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.440]   - Right, we do know that. - That's adrenaline.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.760]   - Adrenaline. - Yeah.
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.400]   - Adrenaline and that tunnel vision
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.000]   and then the frames are fast.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.880]   - Or so if I inject you with just a little bit
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.160]   of adrenaline, it stays in your periphery,
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.760]   but it activates systems in your brain
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.160]   in parallel to that.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.560]   And you're gonna experience an immediate dilation
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.000]   of your pupils, you'll have more tunnel vision.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.260]   I mean, every process is sped up
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.520]   in the direction of higher frame rate.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.220]   - So then the question then became for me,
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.320]   and this would be fun to talk,
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.440]   I've never spoken to a scientist about this process.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.920]   Like how do I learn to do that at will, right?
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.120]   And then how can I train,
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.040]   'cause I can't just pump myself with adrenaline all the time
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.760]   although maybe I can learn to have
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.360]   that physiological response. - You can deploy it.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.880]   - Right, so then how can I deploy it, right?
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.120]   What are triggers for having that chemical change?
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.080]   And then also how can I train
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.400]   so that I have the experience of more frames
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.720]   than my opponent?
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.080]   And so Marcelo Garcia, he's known as the king of the scramble
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.520]   he spends his whole time in transition.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.400]   So if you're training jujitsu with most people,
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.600]   they're always finding a position and holding it.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.320]   Marcelo, one of the unique things about his training life
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.840]   for most of his life was that he never held positions.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.160]   He was always moving, he was always in the in between.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.360]   And it's true in most arts is that people think
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.840]   that the art is the positions that they see,
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.480]   but the real high level art is the space
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.720]   in between the positions.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.440]   So if we have this position leads to this position,
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.340]   that's gonna be like,
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.360]   there's gonna be no frames in between for most people.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.280]   For some people that might be four frames.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.620]   But if I have a hundred frames,
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.000]   then I can play in pockets that you don't see.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.120]   And so if you're living your life in the training process
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.840]   in the in between, in the transition,
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.720]   if you're always, the way that manifests in actual,
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.320]   like for example, jujitsu training
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.720]   or submission grappling training is,
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.640]   if you're not holding positions, you're always moving
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.920]   and you're spending all of your time in the in between,
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.880]   while people who are holding position are always static.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.680]   So if you go to a jujitsu school and you sit and watch,
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.600]   it's interesting to look for this one thing.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.860]   Notice the amount of time static versus in motion.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.160]   Marcelo was always in motion.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.560]   There's a beautiful clip of him that you got,
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.480]   people can look up, it's an art de suave.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.220]   It was an old documentary back in the day,
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:00.600]   like 25 years ago, I think it was.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.440]   It's on YouTube.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.760]   It's like an eight minute clip of him training
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.120]   as an, I think an 18 year old.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.360]   And you watch him just like in the early days
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.480]   of him learning this transitional approach.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.160]   And he's just never stopping.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.560]   He's always allowing the person,
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.640]   but you have to get past the egoic dynamics.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.480]   'Cause you can't, you're giving up
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.440]   on dominating people all the time.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.880]   'Cause when you're in a dominant position in jujitsu,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.360]   you wanna hold it 'cause you've won.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.200]   And there's all this bullshit passing between men
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.840]   who are fighting or women who are fighting each other.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.280]   We wanna dominate.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.200]   But if you release that,
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.840]   and you're thinking about the learning process,
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.040]   then you stop holding, then you're moving,
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.720]   and then you're getting nonstop exposure to the in between.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.480]   So if you spend your life training in the in between,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.160]   then you have more frames than other people do.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.680]   That's what a lot of what illusionists are doing, right?
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.880]   They spend all of their time training
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.480]   in the spaces that other people don't look at.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.880]   And so it's not magic, it's brilliant training.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.360]   It's the art of illusion at the in between, right?
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.160]   And a lot of the things that you can do,
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.520]   a high level martial artist can do
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.960]   to a lower level martial artist
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.240]   or someone who doesn't train that feels mystical.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.760]   It's all about that principle manifest in interesting ways.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.760]   But, and in general, like for me,
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.320]   and this goes back to the question you asked
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.440]   two or three brilliant, expansive questions ago
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.360]   around intense moments.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.240]   A lot of what my training has been
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.040]   is having some serendipitous intense moment
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.780]   and then learning, and then it becomes a beacon.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.440]   So for example, there was a moment I was playing
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.800]   in a world chess championship in Calicut, India,
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.820]   and I was deep into a calculation,
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.120]   couldn't find the solution, and there was an earthquake.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.200]   And everything started like in the actual world,
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.560]   everything started shaking, right?
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.060]   But I experienced the earthquake
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.480]   from the inside of the chess position.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.760]   And I knew there was an earthquake,
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   but I also was lost, my brain was lost in the labyrinth.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.380]   And I found the solution.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:58.600]   And then I got up and left, vacated,
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.480]   'cause we had to leave the playing hall,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.140]   then we came back and I made my move and went on to win.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.680]   And it was so interesting 'cause it was like,
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.200]   and then the earthquake, like my,
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.620]   and a lot of what happens in chess
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.860]   is that you're reaching so deep into the complexity,
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:10.960]   like into the cupboard,
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.120]   but the solution is right here at the front.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.560]   And all you have to do is come back out on the surface.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.920]   One of the best ways, by the way,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.760]   to prevent, to minimize chess blunders
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.160]   with like talented young players
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.720]   or players of any level, any age,
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.920]   is to shift the order of decide,
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.560]   make the move, and then write it down,
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.320]   'cause you notate your chess games,
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.540]   to decide, write it down, and then make the move.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.320]   The write it down is a resurfacing,
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.300]   and you have common sense, look at the position.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.420]   Almost all chess blunders,
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.760]   you realize you've blundered instantly.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.420]   You can think for 20 minutes, make your move,
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.480]   and you know instantly you blundered,
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.560]   'cause there's not that surfacing, right?
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.200]   But then you can learn to just do the surfacing
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.880]   before making the actual move.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.240]   It's true with human decision-making in general.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.480]   - Right, we realize that the screw up
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.560]   right as we complete it.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.740]   - Yeah, because like we're caught up in all of our bullshit.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.680]   We make the move, and then we've left our thought process
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.080]   and like, oh, that was just absurd, right?
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:05.960]   And we see it.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.760]   I mean, you think about,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.720]   I mean, you think about the heartbreaking literature,
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.420]   you know, studies in how people
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.540]   who've jumped off a bridge relate to at the moment
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.860]   after they've jumped off the bridge,
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.140]   those who have survived, right?
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.980]   The interviews afterwards.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.900]   - Yeah, they report wishing they hadn't jumped.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.820]   - Right.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.820]   - Immediately, like they jump,
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.040]   and then they wish they hadn't jumped.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.660]   - Such an important message.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.700]   You know, we hear all this stuff about suicide prevention,
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.020]   and you know, but just that knowledge.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.220]   I mean, I don't know how conscious of that sort of thing
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.820]   people are as they're headed down the trench.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.700]   I mean, what, of suicidal depression,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.960]   but these apertures that we're talking about,
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.800]   these time-space apertures where frame rate is set
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.600]   and visual aperture is set,
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.080]   I think for most people,
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:51.240]   we experience them as sort of notches.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.400]   So it's like, you know, you're in a high state of arousal
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.680]   and you have high frame rate, you know?
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.520]   And then, and just like being like a ball bearing
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.760]   down in a trench,
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.120]   you can't really see out the other side.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.040]   You're literally in there at a certain frame rate
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.320]   of let's say an argument,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.600]   an intense argument with somebody where you want to win
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.960]   and you're frustrated with them,
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.420]   and the whole situation and you're in the trench.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.060]   The, whereas when you're relaxed,
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.020]   it's more, you know, a broad concave or a flat table
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.300]   where the ball bearing can move around at will.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.180]   It sounds like Marcello and people that train
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.720]   these different transition states
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.940]   is you're really learning to access
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.460]   the different frame rates,
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.780]   but from a place of like,
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:32.780]   kind of like a little dimple, you know, in a table,
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.820]   and then being able to move to the next one as a dimple
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.280]   and kind of moving from dimple to dimple
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.440]   as opposed to like these trenches of brain states.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:44.160]   And I think that, you know, I think about this a lot, a lot,
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.000]   because I feel like most bad decisions are made
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.980]   from a high frame rate, high arousal state.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.880]   Most of the terrible things
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.280]   that humans have done to one another, you know,
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.000]   I suppose there's sociopathy and like, you know,
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.360]   pre-planned things, but it tends to,
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.560]   they tend to be associated with high arousal states
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.280]   where people regret what they did.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.500]   All second degree murder, for instance.
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.740]   In any event, I think the ability to move
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:14.300]   through these different arousal states at will is possible.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.700]   You asked earlier, like, how would one do that?
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.440]   Well, the beautiful thing about the visual system
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.700]   in these different frame rates and states of arousal
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.660]   is that it works in both directions.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.180]   So when you're in a higher state of arousal,
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.240]   your visual aperture shrinks, you go to a higher frame rate,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.740]   but it's also true that if you shrink your visual aperture,
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.340]   you go to a higher frame rate.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.480]   The converse is also true.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.600]   If you deliberately, for instance,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.680]   as we're looking across one another right now,
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.080]   if I start to take in the fullness of the picture here,
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.160]   the walls, et cetera,
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.480]   there's a natural relaxation
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.960]   of the autonomic arousal systems,
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.880]   or parasympathetic activity goes up.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   And what's incredible is that anytime we view a horizon,
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.260]   that naturally happens,
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.920]   because you're not setting to a single fixation point.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.120]   So anytime you see a horizon, you relax,
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.560]   and it's not a coincidence.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.560]   So the visual system can drive it inward,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.640]   and your autonomic arousal can drive it
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.880]   toward your visual system.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.000]   The other thing is there's a really beautiful paper
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.920]   that came out about two years ago,
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.760]   which showed that people who do a biofeedback game,
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.200]   where they're watching a little,
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.560]   you know, it's like a more kind of like a sine wave,
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.600]   and they're deliberately trying to increase
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.880]   their level of arousal as the curve goes up,
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.220]   for those that are just listening.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.380]   Within a few days, they can learn to control
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.480]   their pupil size, which sets their arousal
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.660]   and their aperture for a segmenting time.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.540]   So you can learn this through biofeedback,
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.860]   and I think that the script for that is available online.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.700]   I haven't tried it yet,
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.940]   but if you ever heard of these yogis
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.380]   that could control their pupil sizes,
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.580]   even independently of one another, that's amazing,
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.960]   because it's not supposed to be able to occur,
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.060]   but you can.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.300]   So you can learn to, you know,
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.740]   I guess the poor man's version of this
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:58.660]   would be look in the mirror, stare at yourself,
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.860]   and try and ramp up your level of autonomic arousal,
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.940]   watch your pupils get bigger,
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.700]   and then try and relax yourself and make them smaller.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.260]   That practice, it seems, in biofeedback,
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.540]   allows people to do it without staring into the mirror,
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.640]   so to speak.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.340]   So it can be done.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.580]   It's just that it hasn't been parsed by science
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.300]   that finely until recently.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.140]   - It's interesting.
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:21.300]   So I have this term I use called firewalking,
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.140]   which for me, what it means is cultivating the ability
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:29.580]   to learn from experiences one doesn't have
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.740]   with the same somatic intensity
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.140]   that one learns from really intense experiences
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:35.980]   that we have.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.300]   So for example, let's just say you're a jiu-jitsu fighter
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.840]   and you overextend your arm
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.420]   and you're in a world championship
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.820]   and you get your arm broken,
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.020]   or your shoulder ripped off or something.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.180]   So you've lost the world championship
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.580]   and you got a shattered arm.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.740]   You're not gonna overextend your arm that way again.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.420]   You've learned that that lesson is burned in.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.400]   But like if you're watching a jiu-jitsu fight
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.240]   and someone overextends their arm
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.660]   and gets an arm barred and then taps out,
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.500]   it's a very, very different experience.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.740]   How can we cultivate the ability
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:05.380]   to study other people's worst, most heartbreaking blunders,
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:06.520]   worst moments, et cetera,
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.820]   and learn from that with the same somatic intensity
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.760]   that they learned from it, right?
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.180]   So much of that is physiological.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.220]   So I spent a lot of time doing biofeedback
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.580]   and a lot of time doing visualization practices
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.220]   and doing very intense visualization practices
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.140]   and many, many years working with triggers
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.560]   for my own psychology and physiology
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.260]   so that I can get my physiology primed
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.140]   to have an intense learning experience
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.320]   while studying something
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.300]   that might otherwise just feel intellectual.
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.820]   And then combining that with my own experience of things.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.960]   And it's such a, I mean, if we can 100X or 1,000X
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.860]   or 10,000X our learning curve
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.220]   by being able to learn from other things
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:45.500]   with the same intensity that we've learned
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.100]   from our own things, but people don't harness that.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.580]   - Why do you think they don't?
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.780]   Is it, it takes time and it doesn't seem as intuitive
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.120]   as going out and shooting free throws or something like that?
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.220]   - I think people are really amazingly unreflective
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.940]   about the training process.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.340]   But I told you, like, I'm working,
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.100]   I haven't written a book since "The Art of Learning"
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.940]   and I'm a couple years into this beautiful process
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.480]   of writing my next book, which is gonna be called,
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.500]   I think, "The Art of Training,"
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.860]   which is really what I've been cultivating
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.020]   for the last decades.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.060]   And I'm deconstructing my approach to training
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.060]   in mental and physical disciplines.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.300]   And it's really interesting to go through that process
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.700]   myself, like, what have I, what do I do?
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.620]   What have I done?
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.260]   And what have I helped others do?
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.940]   And it's interesting, like, "The Art of Learning"
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.900]   kind of was a birthing process.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.740]   That's what it felt like to me.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.240]   I took notes to it for five years
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.900]   and then after "2004 Worlds," I wrote it in nine months.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.380]   It just kind of came out of me.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.380]   And I'm kind of in that process now with this,
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.540]   so it feels really organic and intrinsic,
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.860]   the creative process.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.500]   And I don't know, it's very interesting
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.260]   when you talk to people who are really playing
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.420]   at elite levels of different fields
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.020]   or who are just below full self-expression
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.780]   or they're just on the edge of virtuosity
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.140]   but not quite there, and you start to deconstruct
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.020]   what they do, there's so much low-hanging fruit
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.500]   that they can do.
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.980]   Why, I don't know.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.940]   I think in many ways people, I mean,
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:11.780]   there's lots of reasons.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:16.380]   I think, for one thing, people who are very talented
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.720]   in arts don't have to be so deliberate
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.180]   about their training often to reach a certain level.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.580]   Often people have other people building
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.260]   their training process and they're not reflective
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:24.680]   about their own training process
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.900]   because they have big teams of coaches
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.340]   who are creating it for them.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:32.900]   People haven't cultivated the art of deconstruction,
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.340]   which is an art that's very important.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.180]   People haven't cultivated the art of loving training,
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:41.400]   which is a hugely important meta-skill to learn.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.600]   People haven't taken on all of the skills
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.080]   around physiological triggers,
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.360]   around changing one's physiological state at will.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.620]   People haven't practiced visualization very intensely.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:59.000]   There are all of these skills that we can put together
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.080]   in order to train at a world-class level.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   But it takes patience and creativity
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.040]   and not just being subject to whatever else does
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.540]   but being able to look expansively at everything.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.080]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.800]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.420]   I recently became a Function member
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.720]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.720]   to lab testing.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.640]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.600]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.240]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.120]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.900]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.160]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.600]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.340]   Function not only provides testing
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.460]   of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health,
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.300]   but it also analyzes these results
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.860]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.700]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.840]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.140]   This was totally surprising to me.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.940]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.820]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.300]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.980]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.300]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.060]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.420]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.340]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.380]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:22.140]   and detoxification, and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.700]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.120]   is so important for health,
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.900]   and while I've been doing it for years,
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.820]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.300]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.220]   both at the level of ease of use,
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.740]   that is getting the test done,
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:37.660]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:41.060]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board,
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.300]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.620]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.900]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.500]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.100]   but they're offering early access
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.340]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.620]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.220]   to get early access to Function.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.660]   We had a guest on this podcast,
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.840]   Jim Hollis, he's an 84-year-old,
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.840]   probably 85-year-old Jungian analyst on,
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.080]   and he, just brilliant guy,
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.120]   he's written some really important books
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.800]   under Saturn's shadow and et cetera,
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.360]   and he said, you know,
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.080]   so he has a real kind of like suit up, show up,
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.440]   you know, get to work kind of mentality,
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.280]   but he also is a very reflective person,
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.480]   and he said, you know, if there's one simple key to life,
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.660]   it's that one understand that most of our daily lives,
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.600]   our waking lives are in stimulus response,
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.920]   but that it's so critical
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.700]   to take 10 to 15 minutes each day
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.520]   to just get out of stimulus and response,
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.600]   and either to just let stuff geyser up
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.360]   out of our unconscious, subconscious mind,
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.120]   or to just put some real thought to something
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.060]   that, you know, most everybody is in stimulus response.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.320]   I wonder these days with social media
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.720]   and so many things filling the space
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.040]   between walking to the car
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.520]   or with the, you know, pro players that you work with,
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.840]   you know, I'm guessing the moment they're on the plane,
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.420]   they're on their phones and texting,
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.580]   and all these things are wonderful technologies,
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:14.120]   but they fill all the space with stimulus response.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.040]   - Yeah.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.560]   - They fill all the space with stimulus response,
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.060]   and, you know, it's not unless you go to a place
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.740]   with no Wi-Fi accessibility
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.160]   that you suddenly realize like, wow,
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.640]   like in most of modern life,
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   we're just constantly in this tennis or ping pong match
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.080]   with this trivial thing and that trivial thing,
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.600]   and some of it's essential,
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.200]   but that there's no quote unquote space anymore.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.560]   - Many ways my life is built around creating that space.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.320]   And it's interesting, when I was playing chess,
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.400]   I experimented with studying chess
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.080]   from everywhere between 45 minutes a day to 16 hours a day
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.600]   to see where the sweet spot was.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.400]   And what I came to is about four and a half hours a day,
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.360]   but that four and a half hours a day was like a 10 out of 10,
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.180]   like fucking just on fire.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.920]   And then the rest of the day became about cultivating
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.760]   those four and a half hours.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.920]   And my life today has that kind of rhythm as well.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.960]   And, you know, training,
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.640]   like I've spent many years working with people
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.520]   who are just brilliant in,
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.600]   the investment space has been a really interesting wave
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.560]   'cause it's a great laboratory,
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.040]   'cause people are very driven.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.960]   They wanna, they're all in, they're motivated.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.000]   They'll take themselves on.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.280]   And it's a great place for me to,
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.160]   over the last couple of decades,
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.640]   to like refine the art of training
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.200]   because I don't like solving for motivation.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.040]   That's one thing.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.520]   And I think part of that relates to that quirky dynamic
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.080]   from when I was seven that I described
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.200]   of always being the target.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.920]   And so never having, like not taking on my weaknesses
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.320]   that was outside of my conceptual scheme.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.280]   And so in many ways, I don't,
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.240]   I haven't really had to struggle with motivation myself
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.280]   for better or worse.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.200]   And I love working with people,
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.040]   partnering with people who are all in,
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.320]   who want to take themselves on.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.360]   I don't love having to motivate people.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.840]   And so a great laboratory for me
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.960]   is with people who have all sorts of problems,
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.000]   who might be obstructed, but who are all in.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.120]   And like you're working with world-class investors
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.400]   and what, you know, they're grinding themselves out
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.480]   14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.240]   Doing less is a huge part of doing much more.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.720]   And then you start to see, like,
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.560]   they might be at, like, if you think about a 10 out of 10
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.880]   as being like, in terms of like,
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.520]   when they're at their very best creatively,
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.440]   they could slip from like a 10 to a two and not even notice.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.400]   And then you begin to cultivate an awareness
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.760]   of where one is in one's creative spectrum, right?
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.000]   And then you start to cultivate the art
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.960]   of stress and recovery and like amping oneself up
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:42.800]   and then releasing.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.120]   And you see that the ability to turn it on
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.500]   is directly connected to the ability to turn it off,
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.500]   as you know.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.760]   If you walk into a fight gym
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.160]   and you study a bunch of fighters in the mats,
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.960]   one great read you can make is looking at the depth
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.200]   of physiological relaxation when the guys aren't fighting.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200]   And you'll see who the highest level fighters are.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.620]   The best guys, man, they can turn it on with wild intensity,
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:06.760]   but their bodies are so mellow when they're not going.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.640]   And then, man, like- - They're so efficient.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.080]   - It's so, that oscillation, that range is so huge, right?
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.920]   But people don't cultivate the art of turning it off
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.280]   in order to learn how to turn it on.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.180]   You know, for many, many years, decades,
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.540]   I've been practicing what I call now the MIQ process,
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:23.020]   most important question process.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.540]   And the essence of it is,
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.020]   it's what I came to as the most potent way so far
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:33.180]   that I've found to train analysts or thinkers
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.420]   in mental arenas.
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:38.260]   You're training people in the art
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.920]   of discovering what matters most.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.540]   If you look at, if you talk to like a great chess player
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.040]   actually looks at less than a lower level chess player,
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.920]   but they look at the right direction.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.280]   So you might think a great chess player,
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.120]   people often think like,
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.320]   "Oh yeah, I can calculate 50 moves deep, 100 moves deep."
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.640]   It's all irrelevant, move two was inaccurate.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.160]   So it was just all an illusion.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.820]   The great chess players might look at much less,
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.600]   but they're looking in the most potent directions.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   The lower level chess players
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.060]   are lost in a sea of complexity, right?
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.300]   So if you're working with like, let's say a scientist
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.940]   or an investor or whatever,
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.500]   them straining their mind
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.320]   for what is the most important question,
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.380]   ideally to begin the practice
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.500]   toward the end of their work day
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.140]   with like release, recovery period with full intensity
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.540]   in a peak performance state,
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.860]   stretch one's mind for what matters most
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:27.860]   and then release it.
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:30.140]   Release the work day completely.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.660]   Don't work all night grinding yourself out at a low level.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.020]   Release and then first thing in the morning,
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.340]   waking up pre-input,
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:37.220]   return one's mind to the critical question
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.580]   and brainstorm on it.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.680]   It's very powerful 'cause you're opening up the,
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.080]   you're systematically opening the channel
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.880]   between the conscious and the unconscious mind.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.840]   You're feeding critical questions to the unconscious,
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.320]   which is processing overnight.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.840]   And like, I know you know all this,
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.720]   like the consistency with which you come up
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.680]   with an insight in the morning is incredible.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.360]   Interestingly, and you'll probably know why
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.160]   much more than me,
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:02.160]   improved dreamer call often happens simultaneously
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.360]   when one starts to have more and more insights
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.520]   about the MIQ in the morning, which is fascinating.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.380]   Then over time, you can have micro-manifestation
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.140]   of this throughout the day before going for a workout,
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.940]   before taking a walk, before taking a break,
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.260]   before taking a piss.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.900]   Instead of going, when you're gonna go to the bathroom
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.340]   in the day, instead of like checking your phone
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   while taking a piss, you pose yourself in MIQ,
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:23.340]   you release it, you do not do anything but piss
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.900]   in the bathroom and breathe and then return
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:27.580]   to the question and you'll have an insight.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.100]   Right, so you're learning to just oscillate
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.140]   between the conscious and unconscious states
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.740]   and you're opening up that channel
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.420]   and you're practicing stress and recovery.
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.320]   Then your physiological workouts are also stress
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.640]   and recovery all the time.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.280]   So you're building that theme in everything that you do.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.840]   And you realize that when you're at your very best
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.600]   for four or five hours a day,
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.840]   you're doing multiples of the work that you're doing
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.160]   if you're just grinding yourself at what I've called
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.400]   in the past a simmering six or whatever
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.360]   at for 15 or 16 hours a day.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.760]   And so people can do so much more in less time.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.200]   And my lifestyle is based on that.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.640]   I'm training very intensely physically
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.120]   and I'm doing really intense mental work
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.840]   and I oscillate between them in beautiful ways.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.080]   And I have a lot of empty space for reflection,
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.920]   for meditation, for zoning my mind on what matters most.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.960]   It's about quality, not quantity.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.440]   But it's so interesting how we live in this culture
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   where just quantity is just consuming everyone.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.680]   - Yeah, well, it's as Hollis said,
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.100]   the stimulus response thing dominates.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.560]   And it dominates, I think, because,
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.860]   well, I have several reflections.
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.720]   First of all, I just have to say,
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.040]   you're absolutely a scientist.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.000]   You just proved it to us
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.360]   through a description of this process,
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.520]   which I might ask you to describe once again,
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.200]   because I think there's so much value
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.960]   in each of the pieces and how it's put together.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.080]   Three things come to mind.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.760]   First of all, yes, indeed, as you know,
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.640]   and listeners of this podcast will know that
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.360]   yet it is during sleep that we reorganize
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.920]   our neural connections and actual neuroplasticity occurs.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.980]   The stimulus is provided in wakefulness
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.580]   and focus and attention.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.420]   But the actual rewiring occurs during sleep,
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.620]   deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.700]   One little fun, I think,
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:19.860]   but also powerful tool that I learned from,
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.180]   maybe you know him as well.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:23.540]   I'm blessed to have Rick Rubin as a very good friend.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.220]   - Oh yeah, Rick and I have had beautiful jams.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.180]   - Yeah, wonderful. - He's amazing.
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:27.020]   Such a wise soul.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.740]   - I've been spending more and more time with Rick,
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:32.540]   but he taught me something extremely valuable,
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.420]   which was the process of taking some time
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.080]   to just lie completely still
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.740]   and let your mind go as wild as it needs to
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.920]   or as calm as it needs to
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.060]   while keeping the body completely still.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.320]   This mimics rapid eye movement sleep
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.840]   when we're paralyzed and the mind is very, very active.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.360]   And I actually think that practices such as yoga nidra,
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.220]   non-sleep deep rest are also mimics
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.600]   of rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.560]   And there are data starting to emerge now
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.480]   that it mimics rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.300]   but in wakefulness.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.160]   So put simply lying still,
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.780]   relaxing the body as much as possible
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.840]   and letting the mind be extremely active.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.320]   Rick also taught me a little trick
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.680]   for which I don't know any science,
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.900]   but it certainly seems to work for me,
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.680]   which is that if you wake up from a dream
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.020]   and you want to continue having that dream,
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.240]   keep your body completely still.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.600]   Whereas if you wake up from a dream
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.240]   and it was a troubling or anxiety provoking dream,
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.240]   move your body.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.680]   And it seems to work extremely well.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.240]   And I have my theories about why this works.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.980]   I have to ask about this process
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.740]   of reflecting on one's own mistakes deliberately,
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.960]   kind of addressing one's own pain points or shame points
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.420]   as such a key feature of your upbringing
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.180]   and your practice around learning.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.540]   Forgive me for going a little bit longer here,
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:53.140]   but recently somebody taught me something extremely useful.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:58.140]   She said, our consciousness is sort of like a lighthouse
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:02.840]   and we have this beam of light sweeping around 360 degrees,
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.800]   but where we have places of shame about whatever,
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   things that were done to us,
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.160]   things that we've done, whatever, just points of shame,
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.920]   things that we don't want people to know about us
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.980]   that we don't even like to think about.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.120]   It's like a stain on that lighthouse.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.100]   And when that light passes through that stain,
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:24.920]   it casts a wedge, a shadow in the shape of a wedge.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.040]   And she described it in somewhat mystical terms.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.120]   She said, it's through that shadow
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.880]   that evil things enter us and that the world can hurt us.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.240]   And that the process of getting over our shame,
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.460]   but also experiencing life in much more fullness
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.920]   and being able to cultivate our craft
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.080]   and be more present for ourselves and for others
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.800]   is a process of going right up to that lighthouse window
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.760]   and looking at the stain and going, that's what it is.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.600]   And that's the process of wiping it off.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.660]   Now that's all, that's just an illustration
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:59.460]   for us to understand what I think
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:00.920]   is the process you're describing,
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.600]   which is that you get right up
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:07.600]   next to your worst nightmares, your worst mistakes,
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.280]   the things you don't want to think about.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.160]   And in doing so, you learn to relax in their presence
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.020]   and they sort of disappear as points of shame.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.520]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.200]   When I wrote "The Art of Learning,"
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.160]   it was in many ways cathartic for me
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.280]   because there were parts of my life
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.060]   that I had felt like I had let myself down.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:38.960]   Like there were parts, like my chess life I moved away from
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.280]   and like there were certain moments of it
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.640]   where I felt like I hadn't fully expressed my potential.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.380]   And I just wrote them all.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.040]   I just shared it all.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.960]   And it was so beautiful.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.600]   It was so cathartic.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.200]   When I think about leadership,
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.160]   I think that it's so important.
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.400]   Like leading with vulnerability is such an exquisite.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.840]   I spent, Joe Mazzullo and I spent today,
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.880]   a couple days ago, with Sean McVay,
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.200]   who's the head coach of the LA Rams,
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.000]   who just a few days after the big loss against the Eagles.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.640]   And we actually ended up watching the tape.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.060]   It was his first watching of the tape
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.200]   of this heartbreaking playoff loss he had.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.320]   And watching him process it.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.280]   And you know, he's such a great leader.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.600]   Both Joe and Sean like lead,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.800]   they both take themselves on more intensely than anything,
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.280]   but they lead with vulnerability.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.640]   Like they go up against their stains.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.960]   And like being authentic there,
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.480]   as opposed to being a leader or a father or a mother
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.240]   or a coach who just keeps it in the pocket,
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.640]   as if they're perfect.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.560]   There's something so inauthentic about that.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.040]   I think in human relationship
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.700]   and in the cultivation of oneself as an artist,
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:55.020]   going right at one's weakness is so powerful.
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.360]   Now, of course, there's also the tender balance
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.520]   of how much we should cultivate our strengths
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.080]   and how much we should be spent shoring up our weaknesses.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.520]   And one of the most important principles,
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.320]   which I learned too late in my chess life,
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.340]   is that we can take on our weaknesses
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.120]   through the lens of our strengths, right?
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.840]   Remember this brilliant sage Russian coach,
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.560]   Yuri Razaev, said to me at one point,
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.040]   "You can learn Karpov through Kasparov."
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.780]   His point being, you can learn
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:23.840]   about the great defensive chess
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:27.660]   through the great defense of great aggressors like you.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.300]   As opposed to just studying Karpov and thinking,
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.900]   what should I, what would Karpov do here?
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.180]   Which was urged to do by other people.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.340]   Like learn defense through offense, right?
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.380]   So it was part of my self-expression.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.480]   I learned that principle too late for my chess life,
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.060]   but it's manifest everywhere else, right?
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.700]   So while we're cultivating our strength,
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.900]   which I think we should do as a way of life,
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.280]   how do we go up against our stains?
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.560]   But in ways that we're not fundamentally,
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.640]   it's not shame.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.680]   I don't relate to, personally, like I don't,
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.720]   that's a word I don't, like shame.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.560]   It's not shame.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.280]   It's like, when it becomes just like a breath pattern,
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.200]   like we lose, we put ourself on the line, we lose.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.320]   We go at it, we study it.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.920]   We, you know, we study how, we study about what,
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.120]   the other thing that's incredible to me
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.320]   is that when you study your losses,
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.440]   when you go up against what you're calling,
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.800]   like that, that's a beautiful image,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.840]   like the shadow of the lighthouse, right?
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.840]   The interconnectedness of the technical,
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.160]   the psychological, and the thematic
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.160]   is so powerful in the learning process.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.180]   Almost every technical mistake that we make in an art,
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:39.480]   if we're pushing ourselves to our limits,
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.820]   if we're like, if you and I are like around the same level
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:42.960]   and we're competing in something,
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.160]   we're about this in anything,
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.000]   like any technical mistake I made
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.400]   will have a psychological dimension
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.240]   because I most likely, my technical weakness was,
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.560]   emerged because I was so psychologically pressured
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.960]   that I wasn't able to solve the technical position, right?
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.680]   Or if you, if I make a psychological error,
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.120]   it's often because I was a little technically
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.600]   out of my water.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.120]   And so it put pressure, extra pressure on my psyche
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.280]   that then you were able to exploit, right?
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.280]   And every technical mistake is local, right?
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.840]   But there's themes, there's like a theme
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:23.700]   that houses hundreds of those technical manifestations.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.680]   So if we are always thinking about the technical,
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.200]   the thematic, the psychological,
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.960]   and we have what I call a six dimensional
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.640]   introspective process, right?
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.480]   And we're looking at all of these,
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.240]   the interconnectedness of those different parts
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.520]   of the human experience of an art or anything else,
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.620]   then the growth curve is incredibly explosive
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.680]   because we recognize, we make a technical mistake
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.240]   and we learn the theme.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.280]   We take on the theme that houses that one,
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.200]   but also houses dozens of others.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.960]   And so as we turn that theme into a strength,
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.520]   into a power zone, then that technical mistake goes away,
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.460]   but as do the other manifestations of that theme.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.520]   And if we're also studying the psychological weakness
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.380]   that allowed that technical weakness to manifest,
[01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.180]   to like unearth itself,
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:04.560]   then that psychological dimension
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.540]   becomes something that we take on.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.840]   And then we're studying thematic interconnectedness
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.680]   as a way of life,
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.560]   because then that lesson we learned through that chest,
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.560]   that like I made a subtle chest mistake,
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.060]   but that connects to my love life.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:16.280]   It connects to my fatherhood.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:20.940]   It connects to my foiling, my jujitsu, my everything,
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.680]   because it connects to the theme
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.080]   and it connects to my psychology and it manifests.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.800]   I don't believe in compartmentalization.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:29.360]   I believe in thematic interconnectedness, right?
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.840]   And like the core themes of my life,
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.800]   I would say if I had to boil it down would be love,
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.300]   interconnectedness, and receptivity.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.000]   I only do what I love
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.560]   and I spend time with people who I love.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.780]   And that's how I live.
[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:46.400]   The study of interconnectedness is my way of life
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.520]   in some of the ways I've been describing.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.280]   And receptivity is what I cultivate every day in my life,
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.540]   in the ocean, with people, with humans.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:58.000]   And we always get isolated.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.920]   We get like siloed.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.260]   Oh yeah, is this chest mistake?
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:04.760]   Like one of the things I've found so confusing
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.440]   is why don't more great chess players
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.900]   who try successfully translate their level
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.300]   from chess to other things?
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.360]   'Cause chess is so hard
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.280]   and chess is such a relentlessly truth-telling art.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.560]   If you become a world-class chess player,
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.720]   you're fucking good 'cause there's no luck in chess.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.700]   - Especially if you become very good very young.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.120]   I mean, I think this is true of most prodigies.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.400]   I don't wanna name them, but I have a colleague,
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.320]   a very smart guy, his science is very solid.
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.560]   And I remember I met with him and I said,
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.200]   "Is it true that you're-" - He's gonna love that.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.200]   - That's okay, he's done nice work.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.040]   I just wouldn't say that it's like transformed
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.280]   our understanding of like everything in that field,
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.840]   but he's made some very important contributions.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.820]   He's a fabulous teacher and a nice person.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.520]   But he's said, one day I was meeting with him
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.360]   and I said, "You're a child prodigy," I heard.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:00.280]   And he said, "Former child prodigy."
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.280]   And I was like, okay, well, here we're getting technical,
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.440]   but yeah, okay, I think we're.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:07.320]   And I asked my dad, 'cause he, my dad lived
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:11.720]   in the same building as Daniel Barenboim, the musician,
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.640]   who's if you've ever seen the movie "Hillary and Jackie,"
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:17.560]   he was one of the world's most accomplished piano players
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.480]   at a very young age.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.880]   And my dad used to hear him playing when he was a kid
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.600]   and like, they wouldn't let him play with other kids.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.880]   And he was like, I mean, Barenboim is a,
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.240]   for classical musicians and pianists in particular,
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.440]   it's like serious stuff.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.740]   And I, so I asked my dad, I was like,
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.760]   "What's the deal with this child prodigy thing?"
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.960]   And he said, "Yeah, very few of them go on to do much
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.200]   "in their adult careers, in any field."
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.040]   - Right.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.880]   - And I was like, wow.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.680]   And I thought, okay, so what's missing there
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.160]   is clearly not a lack of ability, focus.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.480]   I mean, you could just say raw talent,
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.960]   but you still have to, kid still has to focus.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.460]   So what's missing is this transfer of understanding,
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.540]   it seems, or what you're talking about,
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.380]   the interconnectedness of things.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:07.860]   And so, yeah, I probably will get myself in trouble
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.260]   with this colleague, but hey, listen,
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:10.540]   maybe he'll take on something new
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:14.740]   and do something additionally spectacular.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.720]   He's got a lot of things on his plate.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.260]   But that struck me, I was like, oh, it's not clear
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.980]   that being a "child prodigy" is such a good thing
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.300]   for the long arc of one's life.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:31.300]   But you have seemed to bring in these other elements, love.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.520]   I'd like to talk more about that.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.120]   And I would also add,
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.840]   at least from an outsider's perspective of,
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.720]   you seem to have broken the mold
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.240]   with kind of what's expected of you,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.400]   based on your prior accomplishments.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.240]   - Well, I have no identity in being a prodigy,
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.160]   just to be clear.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.480]   So I don't relate to that word at all.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.480]   I mean, that word has been put on me from the outside,
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.600]   but I just don't associate with it.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.100]   I don't relate to it at all.
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:06.140]   Because I was maybe somewhat talented in chess
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.900]   compared to most people.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:12.260]   But then very early in my,
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.780]   by the time I was like six and something,
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:18.700]   I was only competing against people
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:19.700]   who were better than me,
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.980]   and kids who were as talented as me.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.380]   And then on the world stage,
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.140]   kids who are more talented than me.
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.960]   And I couldn't rely on my talent at all,
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.840]   because I mean, I had to work my ass off.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   And I won, I lost, and I got my ass kicked.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.320]   And so for me, it was all about the battle
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.500]   and taking myself on.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.960]   And I think what happens, it's funny,
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:42.960]   many years ago, I was giving a simultaneous chess exhibition
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.940]   and I showed up at this place,
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.780]   and all these kids were there
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.040]   and they're all excited to play against me.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.480]   And then the organizer of it said,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.820]   "My son hasn't lost a chess game in two years."
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:54.440]   And that's all you need to know.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.420]   'Cause it's just like, that means you're just,
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:58.260]   and of course he was the one
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.880]   'cause he didn't wanna play against me, right?
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.440]   'Cause if you haven't lost a chess game in two years,
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.720]   you're not taking your shit on.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.060]   You're finding people who you can beat
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.700]   and you're only playing against them.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.600]   So there's a couple levels to this, let's dig into it.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.740]   So I think that people who have identity
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.540]   in being a prodigy develop a brittleness often,
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:17.880]   because they associate their level of mastery with talent,
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.860]   with something innate, with being smarter,
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:22.820]   more brilliant, more gifted, whatever.
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.880]   And then that is, you think about Carol Dweck's work
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.680]   in entity incremental theories of intelligence, right?
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.680]   That's an entity theory of intelligence.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.840]   So I think there's that,
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.480]   and there's something fundamentally brittle about that.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.800]   And then one doesn't take risk, one doesn't expose oneself,
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.780]   one associates one's great moments
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.680]   with something ingrained or innate
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.840]   versus the hard work that it took to get there.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:46.000]   And there's all sorts of paralyzing dynamics there.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.780]   - Oh, there's also a tendency to lie.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.400]   Carol's early papers referred to this
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.480]   in the discussion sections.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.980]   You have to read deep into those papers,
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:56.860]   but she describes how the students
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.360]   who did not have growth mindset,
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.360]   that really identified and held so much of their ego
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.040]   with their performance,
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.840]   were at a significantly greater tendency
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.560]   to lie about their performance when they didn't do well.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.440]   - To themselves and to others.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.280]   - That's right.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.100]   - But the lying to oneself
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.800]   is the really interesting part, right?
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.800]   So there's that dimension, right?
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.400]   Which you and I have both seen
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.840]   just countless manifestations of.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.460]   And believe me, when you're competing against someone
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:27.480]   who you see has that kind of psychological construction,
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.320]   they're done.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.440]   You can just break them, right?
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.680]   You can, there's so many chinks in the armor.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:37.960]   So there's a brittleness there.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.760]   Like you can just find where their mind stops
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.680]   when false constructs, where the energy stops,
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.320]   where their bodies crimped, right?
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.080]   Like you can just find their connection to the ground
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.200]   and explode through it.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.560]   In mental and physical disciplines,
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.420]   if someone has that kind of identity
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:54.360]   in being the more brilliant one,
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.080]   the more gifted one, whatever,
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.360]   they're prey from a competitive perspective,
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.840]   which is ultimately good for them
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.080]   if they expose themselves to it
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.840]   'cause then they have to take themselves on.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.240]   But the dynamic that I was reflecting on in chess players
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.960]   is a little next door to this,
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.880]   which is that I think that,
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.960]   like if you're learning how to play chess,
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.120]   and let's just say I was teaching you,
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.020]   do you play chess?
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.200]   - Trivially.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.000]   - Okay, so let's say I was teaching you to play chess.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.920]   I could teach you to play chess
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:28.840]   with a language that is chess specific,
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.040]   or I could teach you chess principles.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.340]   I could teach you very effectively with chess principles,
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.320]   but I could also teach you just as effectively
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.040]   or maybe somewhat more effectively,
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.800]   but let's just say just as effectively
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.680]   with chess principles that are also life principles.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.160]   And it's interesting when you watch most chess teachers,
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.400]   they teach in a localized manner.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400]   So people can spend 20 years inside of chess
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.320]   but never break beyond the 64 squares.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.800]   Or they can from the age of six or seven on
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.680]   be learning that principle as it connects to chess,
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.200]   but also seeing how it connects to life.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.380]   - Could you give me an example of one such principle?
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:02.400]   Because I love in biology teaching not names,
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.560]   not using nouns, but instead teaching verbs.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.320]   Because ultimately, if you want to understand,
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.960]   for instance, how the nervous system works
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.200]   or the immune system,
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.480]   you teach the verb actions of molecules.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.480]   And the names of the molecules are important
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.200]   if you decide to go into that field professionally,
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.640]   but otherwise the principles and verbs
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.520]   are what's most important.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:23.480]   So what's an example of a principle of chess
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.960]   or a mode of action on the board that you think transfers?
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.440]   - Everything transfers, first of all.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.040]   Like, I mean, if we're open to it,
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.080]   then everything in chess connects.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.640]   And so when people ask me, do you still play chess?
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.280]   I say metaphorically.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.540]   I mean, I play chess all the time.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:40.880]   I just have not moved a piece in many, many, many years.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.480]   Right, so, but okay, to be specific.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.180]   So I could give you many examples, but all right.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:50.080]   So in chess, there's a bishop and there's a knight, right?
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.640]   They're both worth about three pawns.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.000]   Now I could teach you, okay,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.240]   so the knight moves like an L and can jump over pieces.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.400]   The bishop moves diagonally
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.240]   and is stuck on one color for its whole life.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.200]   They're both worth about three pawns.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.800]   But knights are, and I could just say to you,
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:07.120]   but like knights are a little bit better
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.240]   in closed positions 'cause they can jump over things.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.080]   Bishops are a little better if the pawns,
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.640]   if your pawns are on the opposite color from them, right?
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.640]   But you should also know that rooks and bishops are,
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.680]   the bishops and knights are about the same.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.600]   Rooks and bishops are much stronger than rooks and knights.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.920]   And you should also know that queens and knights
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.660]   are a bit stronger than queens and bishops.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:32.440]   So the bishop's value is a little bit stronger
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.600]   compared with a rook and the queen,
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.460]   knight's value a little bit stronger with a queen
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:38.040]   and pawn structure influences them, right?
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.400]   So I could teach you a very simple set of principles
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.100]   through which you can understand
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.720]   how to evaluate bishops and knights, right?
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.320]   And there's many other layers to that,
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.520]   but like that's some of it, right?
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.120]   I could also teach you the same thing
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.120]   and be teaching you like the nature of relativity.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:41:00.600]   I could be teaching you the nature of interdependence, right?
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.260]   I could teach you the nature of,
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.680]   like I could teach you the pawn structure play that,
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.760]   like the way you can play with pawn structure
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.000]   that influences bishops and knights
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.560]   in ways that are chess specific
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.060]   or in ways that just allow you
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.340]   to understand dynamic quality and static quality.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:18.440]   - You know what leaps to mind when you made that description
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.000]   and I didn't follow all of it to memorization
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.320]   was family feud.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.700]   I just imagined two families in a feud, right?
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.720]   You get two brothers together, they can do certain things.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:32.160]   We get a brother and sister together, I have a sister.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.800]   She can do certain things that are powerful
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.300]   and diabolical in ways that two brothers can't.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.520]   Yeah, so you get two big strong brothers,
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.000]   but maybe one that can't creep through small places.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.200]   And so you can map to different,
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.000]   that's sort of more than just kind of an analogy for it all.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.280]   But I started to immediately think about like,
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.800]   oh, it's like a family feud.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.440]   If I were to view the pieces as sibling dynamics
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.340]   and parent-sibling-cousin dynamics,
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:58.060]   it's like matchups with humans or in basketball.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.640]   Like this team is better than this team and this team,
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.420]   but again, there's some matchups
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.400]   that are hugely favorable.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.240]   A lot of like the inside game of basketball
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:09.760]   is around which teams thrive against which other teams,
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.460]   even though they might be inferior
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:13.440]   because of the nature of the construction of the team.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.780]   And you have networks of those teams
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.160]   and how do you deal with lineups,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.720]   how do you deal with rotation patterns?
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.080]   Like the inner game of basketball is all based on
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.040]   the same stuff that dictates the bishop and the knight
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.560]   and the rook and the queen and how they influence it.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.920]   It's interdependence. - Beautiful.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.680]   - It's relativity, it's dynamic quality.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.240]   And you can think about Robert Persik's work
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.520]   in "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.120]   and Lila around dynamic quality versus static quality.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.640]   And you can be teaching a student,
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.680]   while you're teaching about rook and bishop
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.360]   and rook and knight or knights and bishops,
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.800]   you can be teaching them about dynamic quality, right?
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.780]   And then you can like expand into the study
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.000]   of the metaphysics of quality.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.720]   And then you can have a seven-year-old student
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.880]   who's learning chess or a 12-year-old who's learning chess
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.080]   or who's learning about life and philosophy and everything,
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.360]   and you can do it in the same amount of time.
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.280]   But you're trapping a mind inside of 64 squares
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.000]   or you're teaching a mind about life through the 64 squares.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.380]   And I think so many of the reasons
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:07.000]   that people who become excellent in one thing
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.400]   can't translate it into other places,
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:12.300]   it's not will later on in life, they have the will,
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.920]   it's because they didn't learn with universal principles.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.700]   They didn't study their art with a presence
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:20.000]   to the importance of interconnectedness,
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.200]   which is a lot of what my life's work is in.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.280]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:26.360]   and thank our sponsor, Eight Sleep.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.080]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.720]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.240]   Now, I've spoken before on this podcast
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:34.440]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.200]   of quality sleep each night.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.480]   Now, one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.980]   is to ensure that the temperature
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.080]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.180]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.000]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.680]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.280]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:53.440]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.000]   about one to three degrees.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.280]   Eight Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.360]   of your sleeping environment by allowing you
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.360]   to program the temperature of your mattress cover
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.080]   at the beginning, middle, and end of the night.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.840]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.320]   for nearly four years now,
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.120]   and it has completely transformed
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.100]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.360]   Eight Sleep recently launched their newest generation
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.200]   of the pod cover called the Pod 4 Ultra.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.240]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.280]   I find that very useful because I like to make the bed
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.920]   really cool at the beginning of the night,
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.720]   even colder in the middle of the night,
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.720]   and warm as I wake up.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.740]   That's what gives me the most slow wave sleep
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.920]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.600]   It also has snoring detection
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.760]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:37.520]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.520]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.420]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.620]   This is Eight Sleep's biggest sale of the year.
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:54.640]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.220]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:00.400]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.480]   When I think about interconnectedness,
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.640]   I think the word mapping comes to mind,
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:07.200]   and I define a map of any kind
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.000]   as a transformation of one set of points
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.600]   into another set of points, right?
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.960]   Points along the earth transferred onto a page
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.240]   or an electronic map, you know?
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.520]   And what's missing from a kind of basic understanding
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:18.600]   of a transformation of points
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.360]   into another transformation of points
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.440]   are these verb actions,
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.880]   like it's the algorithms, if you will.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:29.060]   That's not present in how we map one context
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:30.400]   onto another context.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.440]   It requires a lot of thinking to do what you describe.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.680]   I don't think it's reflexive for most people
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.240]   to say, watch a game of basketball
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.560]   and think about the emotional dynamics
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.040]   and the consistencies of the emotional dynamics.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.600]   Like last night, I had the great gift
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.140]   of Josh brought me to a Celtics game.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.480]   So he brought me to a Celtics game
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.600]   and they were playing the Clippers.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.920]   So I was cheering against the hometown crowd
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.440]   here in Los Angeles, but it was friendly.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.920]   And you were describing the players and their recent history
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.480]   and the kind of last season, the season.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.320]   And you said something about the difference
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.000]   between pre-conscious effort and post-conscious effort.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.680]   Maybe we could talk about that as a gateway into ego,
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.880]   which is like a term that the moment you said,
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.960]   throughout the word ego, it's like saying sex.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.120]   It's like people make all sorts of assumptions
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.200]   about what it is and what it isn't.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.480]   But let's talk about pre-conscious and post-conscious.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.800]   Because we'll get back to the Celtics
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.400]   and the game that was played last night.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.720]   By the way, the Celtics won in overtime
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.080]   by a good size margin.
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.920]   So there's something very beautiful
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.800]   that I think all of us are drawn to as observers,
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.040]   but hopefully everyone gets to experience this
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.800]   at some point in their life as well firsthand.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.000]   When somebody in art, music, sport, or whatever
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.960]   is just being themselves
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.000]   and this seeming virtuosity comes out.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.940]   If I think about kind of what Rick Rubin does,
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.000]   a lot of what Rick has done historically
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:02.080]   is to find artists and work with artists
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.440]   and just bring out what they're already doing,
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.600]   like the core elements.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.120]   Like when Beastie Boys started, it was like a joke, he said.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.400]   And then we're kind of making fun of had wrestling elements
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.800]   and hardcore and punk and all this stuff and hip hop.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.840]   And, you know, but he tends to work with artists early on
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:19.020]   when they're in that really like pure state
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:21.580]   of not thinking about the returns on their investment
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:22.420]   and all that.
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:25.200]   And, you know, he said many times before to me
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.800]   and publicly that, you know,
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:29.200]   after people achieve a certain level of fame,
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.780]   it's much harder to get back to that
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:33.720]   just pure picture of oneself, pre-conscious expression.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.960]   Just Josh being Josh as an eight-year-old,
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.460]   you just happen to be in Washington Square Park
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:39.960]   learning chess or, you know,
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.840]   pick any number of different examples.
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:45.000]   So very different than when people now reflect
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.560]   on their trophies on the wall or their platinum records
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.640]   or the fact that they won and lost
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.840]   or that there's another champion in the house that,
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.840]   you know, and the real virtuosos seem to be people
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:03.240]   that can get back to that over and over again.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.120]   The Yo-Yo Ma's, the, you know,
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.640]   and people live longer now.
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.080]   So it used to be the Mozart's, the Bach's, you know,
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.360]   they could make their contribution and then they died.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.680]   Yeah, now we live longer lives.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:21.640]   So people have many more chances,
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:26.040]   but there's also that longer window for lack of productivity.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.440]   - This is a really important theme
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:29.840]   and it's a gateway into so much.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.480]   Like we can explore a lot through this tunnel.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:34.240]   When I use this term pre-conscious
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:35.920]   and post-conscious artist or competitor,
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.160]   it's my own language.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.920]   So I'll describe what I mean by it.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.000]   When you think about myself in the chess world, right?
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.720]   Like one discovers an art, one feels a passion for it,
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.240]   one, it's beautiful, it's joyous, it's self-expressive,
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.900]   I love the battle, I'm winning, I'm losing,
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.200]   I'm having fun, I'm just letting it rip, right?
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.080]   There's a naivete to that.
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.760]   There's a freedom, there's a playfulness, right?
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:02.240]   There's a lack of complexity, a lack of self-awareness,
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.080]   a lack of awareness of my own mutability,
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:09.560]   a lack of awareness that I can be shattered or I can die,
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:12.240]   a lack of awareness of the existential absurdity
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:13.840]   of the fact that I'm devoting my life
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:17.920]   to 64 squares and 32 pieces of wood on top of 64 squares.
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.820]   I haven't reflected on the fact that this is ridiculous,
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:24.020]   right, or if you're fighting, like what am I doing?
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.180]   I'm spending my life in combat.
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.420]   Like what about love?
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:27.420]   What about saving the planet?
[01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.960]   What about everything else?
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.100]   I haven't reflected on the fact that this is just a joke
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:34.900]   in its absurdity, right?
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:37.860]   And one's liberated from those kinds of things.
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.340]   And then there comes this moment,
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:42.580]   and for me it was triggered by the movie,
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:45.780]   by losing that sense of self-expression,
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:47.460]   by thinking what would someone else do here
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:50.780]   instead of what's my freedom,
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:52.400]   my playfulness tell me to do?
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:56.400]   It can happen when one has a near-death experience, right?
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.880]   It can happen when one has one's heart broken.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.120]   It can happen when one
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.360]   starts reading existentialist literature
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.260]   and reflecting on the absurdity of things,
[01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.680]   or one has a friend who starts pointing out over and over,
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.200]   like this is fucking ridiculous.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.040]   You're just playing chess.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.640]   What are you doing, right?
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:17.740]   Or it can happen when one wins the World Championship
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:20.060]   or the NBA Finals because suddenly the thing
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.620]   that you have oriented yourself around,
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:25.340]   your whole life, the goal you had your whole life,
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.540]   you've now accomplished.
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:29.300]   And now you're on the other side of it.
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:31.180]   And so suddenly your world has shifted.
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.680]   The things that motivated you no longer motivate you.
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.980]   The things that felt so important to you
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.260]   now seem somewhat trivial
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:38.220]   because you've already accomplished that.
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:39.780]   Like where's the intrinsic motivation?
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:42.940]   Where's the deep self-expression, right?
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:43.840]   You think about,
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.460]   like as we gain complexity in our psychology,
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:50.820]   and we can gain that complexity in many different ways,
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:52.540]   we hit this tunnel, right?
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:54.640]   And often when someone becomes self-aware,
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.420]   or when someone becomes less liberated,
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.760]   or like the chains set in,
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:03.860]   or when one, I guess you say you're an extreme athlete,
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.220]   but you feel invincible.
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.860]   And then suddenly you have a terrible accident.
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:08.940]   You realize, holy shit, I could actually die.
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:09.860]   I can break.
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:12.200]   Then how do you get back to that freedom
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.020]   of taking the wild risks that you've been taking
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.460]   as that extreme athlete
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.780]   with an awareness of the fact that you can die?
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:21.400]   Like for me, I foil now in the biggest waves
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:24.540]   that I can find in where I live in Costa Rica.
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:27.140]   And you have big hold downs.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:29.740]   You're foiling on top of a long mass,
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.420]   which is a carbon mass, which is very sharp,
[01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:32.460]   and then a wing, which is sharp.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:34.220]   So you're basically going 40, 45 miles
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.580]   on top of a guillotine.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.340]   And if you're trying to,
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:38.900]   you're really cultivating high-performance foiling,
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:40.620]   you're pushing turns really hard.
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:41.620]   You're breaching wingtips.
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:42.860]   Like you can taco and have the thing
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.260]   come right at your head or your neck.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:46.680]   Like you can die at any minute if you get something wrong,
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.340]   which is very different from just like foiling straight
[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:49.580]   or e-foiling.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:52.220]   We're talking about high-performance training.
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.580]   Like you, by definition, have to be risking these things
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:56.860]   in order to push the limits of what's possible.
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.580]   And if you're not, you're not at that stretch point, right?
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:01.580]   But then suddenly, like you have a terrible injury,
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:02.620]   or let's just say you're,
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:04.580]   like I drowned in the bottom of a pool
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:08.180]   some 11 years ago, 10, 11 years ago.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:09.020]   - Yeah, I heard about this.
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.820]   Yeah, it was a, I was doing hypoxic breath work.
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.100]   I did not realize, which maybe if I'd,
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.780]   you could have taught me if I'd known you
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.420]   that carbon dioxide is what gives you the urge to breathe.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.380]   I didn't realize that.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.780]   So I had all the CO2 flushed out of my body.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:22.620]   I felt blissful.
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:23.780]   I was swimming underwater.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:27.340]   - Yeah, exhale, I guess we should save a few lives here
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:29.800]   or prevent a few deaths rather.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:31.860]   Anytime you emphasize the duration
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:33.780]   or intensity of your exhales,
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:35.780]   you're gonna blow out more carbon dioxide.
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:38.860]   Carbon dioxide is the trigger for the gasp reflex.
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:40.260]   So yes, you'll be able to hold your breath
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:41.580]   longer above or below water
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.860]   if you first do cyclic hyperventilation
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.740]   and then a long, and dump all your air,
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:50.340]   but never, ever, ever do cyclic hyperventilation, folks,
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:52.820]   or any long exhale-emphasized breathing,
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.180]   even standing in a puddle,
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:57.420]   because that gasp reflex is the thing
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:53:00.640]   that makes you shoot for the surface.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.420]   And if you don't do that,
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:05.100]   you feel pretty peaceful until it lights out.
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:05.920]   - Or drive a car.
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:06.980]   Don't do it while driving a car.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:07.820]   - Or drive a car.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:08.900]   I know people who have done that.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.340]   Actually, rather exceptional people who I know have done it.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:13.420]   - Dumping carbon dioxide will let you
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:15.780]   hold your breath longer, but that's part of the problem.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.700]   - And shallow water blackout usually happens
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:19.860]   to very high-level athletes, Navy SEALs,
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:21.660]   'cause they're training at pushing their limits.
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:24.740]   They're learning to suppress the urge to breathe.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:26.220]   If you're flushing CO2, you're learning,
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:27.540]   you're training yourself not to feel it.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:28.820]   And I've been a free diver my whole life.
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.180]   I grew up free diving, spearfishing
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:31.700]   in the Southern Bahamas,
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:34.580]   but I wasn't doing hypoxic breath work while free diving.
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:36.020]   Here I was at the NYU pool.
[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:37.500]   I drowned, I was in the bottom of the pool
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.820]   for four and a half minutes after blacking out, which--
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:40.860]   - Four and a half minutes.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:42.900]   - Yeah, I should have, which I know because--
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:43.740]   - You should be dead.
[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:46.140]   - I should be dead or brain damaged in a big way.
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:49.340]   I know the time it was because there was an old man
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.540]   who I knew who was in the locker room
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.700]   who saw me in the bottom of the pool lying there,
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:55.500]   and he timed his laps, and he did four laps.
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.880]   And he said, "After the third one, I'm gonna check on him."
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.180]   And then he did his fourth lap,
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.940]   pulled me in his lap for a little bit over a minute.
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:04.620]   And I was unconscious for 25 minutes.
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:09.300]   I was totally blue, except my face was blown out red,
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:13.620]   my eyes, my body, my training almost killed me
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:14.500]   and also saved me.
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:15.780]   My body handled it really well.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:18.020]   I had no water in my lungs.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:20.300]   I spent that night in the hospital, of course.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:23.460]   And I was like testing my, I remember doing,
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.180]   like remembering old chest variations,
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:27.740]   like testing my mind in any way, like was I ruined?
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:32.660]   And I somehow survived, and I survived intact.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:36.600]   And that's one of those moments, shattering moments,
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.500]   which I am ultimately grateful for
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.340]   'cause it's what catalyzed me to,
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.500]   I emerged with more of a commitment,
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.220]   and I've had this kind of commitment in my life
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:47.340]   for most, for many years, but a more intense commitment
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:49.460]   to live life as truly and beautifully
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.340]   and authentically as conceivable.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.920]   And then soon after, we moved to the jungle,
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.380]   and we lived life we live now,
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.780]   which is awesome for my family.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:02.780]   But I bring that up now because like imagine how one relates
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:06.780]   to big wave surfing or big wave foiling
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.900]   pre and post drowning, right?
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:12.460]   There's like one has to have an integrated sense
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:16.900]   for one's own mortality versus being naive
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.940]   to the fact that it can happen, right?
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.140]   So that tunnel from the pre-conscious
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:24.080]   to the post-conscious performer is a passage
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.900]   where during that passage, most people are locked up.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:28.500]   They underperform where they were
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.340]   when they were more naive.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.580]   And I don't personally relate to it
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:34.860]   as a return to the pre-conscious state.
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:39.020]   I relate to it as an integration of one's mortality,
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:44.020]   of the existential absurdity into one's consciousness,
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.100]   and then a discovery of a deeper sense
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.500]   of liberation, of freedom,
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:50.020]   but that is not in denial of what we've learned
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:52.340]   in that tunnel or what triggered that tunnel,
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:55.820]   but that is more complex.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:57.660]   - Yeah, trying to be our previous selves
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:59.280]   is not a great strategy.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:01.660]   Trying to integrate our previous experiences
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:04.780]   in our current and future selves seems like a good strategy.
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:05.820]   - I feel that way.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:08.880]   And I think it's also pretty, you can't go back.
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.700]   You can't pretend you're not, dying is impossible.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.500]   You can't pretend that you're unbreakable.
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:14.660]   We are breakable.
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:17.600]   Some people do it without being really reflective,
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.960]   but I think that if you ask anyone who really
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:22.700]   has been in life and death situations
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.340]   as a way of life for a long time,
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.100]   whether they relate to the idea of fearlessness,
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:31.100]   if they really reflect on it, they'll say no,
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.980]   because fearlessness isn't a thing.
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:35.840]   It's how one works with fear.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.500]   Usually what locks people up isn't fear.
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:38.800]   It's the fear of fear.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.020]   We're afraid of our fear.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.340]   We're afraid of being afraid,
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.040]   but you ask a great Navy SEAL.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.620]   They work with their fear.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.500]   You ask a great MMA fighter.
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:49.540]   They're not without fear.
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:50.500]   Of course they have fear.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:52.900]   If they don't have fear, they have a problem, right?
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.460]   And there are some examples of people
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:57.300]   who might be wired a little bit differently, right?
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:01.740]   But the integration of the more complex worldview
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:06.060]   into one's liberation is the post-conscious performer, right?
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:08.140]   And it can play in lots of ways, right?
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.780]   It can also play, and so one thing
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:10.860]   when you think about a sports team
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.340]   that has accomplished everyone's dreams
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.460]   and now we want to win a championship again,
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.180]   we can't go back to what worked before
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.940]   because they're different men, right?
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.760]   One needs to find a different kind of mission,
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.540]   a different kinds of internal relationship to the mission,
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.060]   a different kind of freedom.
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.820]   - How important do you think it is to attach language
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:35.380]   to these things of identity and source of motivation?
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:36.620]   In other words, let's say, okay,
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:37.580]   you're working with the Celtics.
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.780]   They won the championship last year.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:43.500]   This year, they are in a completely different mental frame
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:45.420]   as a consequence.
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:49.340]   They're "dominant" in the sense that they hold the crown,
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:52.620]   they hold the trophy, but they're more vulnerable too
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:55.560]   because the only place to go from there is either stay
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.640]   or you're going down a notch or more.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:57:59.920]   So do you think it's important for them
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.960]   to create a verbal label for where they're at?
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.000]   Like, we're the champs and we're going to hold on
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.240]   to the belt, we're going to hold on to,
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.880]   I realize there's not a belt in basketball, by the way,
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:11.280]   that they're going to hold on to their status,
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:13.220]   or is that the wrong way to think about it?
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:16.160]   Because the game is played through verbs.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.080]   It's not played through adjectives.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.120]   - I don't think we ever want to hold on to,
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.620]   like, that's static.
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:25.420]   Like, we need to, we want to,
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:27.420]   like, you think about predator and prey dynamics
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:31.780]   in the world or in competition or in anything.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:34.340]   Like, you want to be competing.
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:35.940]   Now, there's a fusion of the predator and prey.
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.340]   You want to have the awareness that prey has,
[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:42.100]   but one wants to be playing to win, not to lose.
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.700]   The moment we're trying to hold on
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:44.540]   to something we already have,
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:47.440]   we're falling into the static quality, right?
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:51.180]   Or you think about, for example, brilliant investors, right?
[01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:52.880]   They'll have success.
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:54.600]   Then they'll try to figure out how to replicate their success
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:55.540]   so they'll build mental models,
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.280]   frameworks to replicate their success.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.920]   And those become grooves, like neural pathways.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.140]   So then they follow those grooves,
[01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:04.120]   but then the grooves become a rut and the water stops.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:06.500]   And they get stuck in an old, like,
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:09.400]   so they succeeded, they built mental models,
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.640]   they recreated the patterns, it was beautiful,
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:14.000]   but then it got static.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.920]   And then it's that stuck energy
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:17.440]   that doesn't apply to the world
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.840]   'cause the world's changing.
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:21.260]   And what actually made them succeed was dynamic quality,
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.260]   was being at what Robert Persik would call
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.620]   the front of the freight train,
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:25.900]   driving through space-time,
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:28.360]   pre-intellectual consciousness, right?
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.220]   And then they're trying to recreate it.
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:31.540]   They're getting too stuck in things
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:33.300]   and they create mental models that are stale,
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:35.180]   and then other people replicate those stale mental models,
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:36.640]   and you have huge industries that emerge
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.500]   from static quality later and on top of static quality,
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:41.700]   which is most of humanity, right?
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:43.540]   So I think that as a world-class competitor
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:46.340]   who's trying to win after winning,
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:48.700]   one needs to have the same dynamic mindset one had
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.600]   when one was hunting for it in the first place.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.480]   Rediscovery.
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.320]   Marcelo Garcia, one of my most,
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.380]   one of my favorite moments of Marcelo was,
[01:59:56.380 --> 02:00:00.840]   so we were, so Marcelo, nine-time world champion
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:04.120]   in the grappling arts, five-time ADCC,
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:07.920]   five-time Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, four-time ADCC.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:10.080]   ADCC is when Abu Dhabi Combat Championship,
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.640]   when all the different grappling arts come together.
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:12.840]   It happens every two years.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:17.320]   So Russian Sambo, Judo, Wrestling, Jiu-Jitsu, right?
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:19.000]   Everything comes together and you see
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.060]   who's the strongest grappler in all the different arts.
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:25.640]   He's known by many as the greatest
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:27.480]   pound-for-pound grappler to ever live.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:31.940]   Just for context, Marcelo is one of my dearest friends.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.260]   We own a school together in New York.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:36.500]   We trained together for a very, very long time.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:39.520]   He and his, he's in an amazing moment right now.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:43.660]   He and his wife Tachi, who's also one of my dearest friends,
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.420]   had a terrible tragedy years ago.
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:50.420]   They lost a baby, and just devastating period.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:53.020]   And then Marcelo had cancer.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.860]   He had stomach cancer.
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:59.900]   He had surgery, eight rounds of chemotherapy.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:01.540]   He hasn't competed in 13 years,
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:03.100]   and he's actually competing tomorrow
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:07.340]   for the first time in, I think it's 13 years, in Bangkok.
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:09.100]   It was gonna be in Denver, and I was gonna fly there
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:11.260]   between the Lakers and the Mavs games,
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:12.880]   but it's in Bangkok, so I can't get there.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.900]   But he's weighed in, he's doing great.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:15.740]   He's feeling awesome.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.140]   So the story I'm about to tell
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:20.500]   is about this epic, beautiful human being
[02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:24.640]   who in many ways created, he's the innovator
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:27.260]   that led to much of what is modern grappling today.
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:31.300]   So back in, I think it was 2005 and 2007,
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:32.860]   this story, or maybe 2007, 2009.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.820]   I think it's 2005 and 2007.
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.700]   Chronology is not a strong point for me
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:39.020]   in terms of my recollection in general.
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:42.320]   We were in a training camp.
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:45.460]   We were training all the time.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.220]   He had this innovative repertoire.
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:49.820]   He goes into ADCC, dominates it,
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.540]   and it's a very specific repertoire,
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.460]   back-taking repertoire, guillotines.
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:57.580]   Just dominates, blows the grappling world away.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:00.740]   For the two years that followed him winning that ADCC,
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.740]   the entire grappling world was studying
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:05.340]   what he had just done, or a lot of the grappling world
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:07.380]   was studying what he had just done and recreated.
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:10.180]   It was so beautiful, innovative, powerful,
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:13.100]   playing up-weight classes, just unbelievable.
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:15.860]   I was on the mats with Marcelo the next day,
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:17.560]   the Monday after he fought Sunday.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:21.580]   I also wanna say, Marcelo never, I never,
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.580]   in all the years I had of training with Marcelo,
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:25.860]   I never saw him miss a Monday training
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:28.380]   after winning a major competition on Sunday.
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:29.220]   - Wow.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.420]   - Everyone takes time off.
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:31.700]   I never saw him miss a Monday.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:34.040]   You talk about dynamic quality and humility
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.680]   and a way of life, right?
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.260]   The Monday he was on the mats, he shed the entire repertoire.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.500]   So he just won the world championship.
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:44.900]   Everyone spent the next two years chasing his quality,
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:46.720]   which was dynamic, they turned it static.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:47.820]   He shed the whole repertoire
[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:49.220]   and created a whole new repertoire.
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.900]   And he was playing this Omoplata game,
[02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:53.700]   which he then went on the next ADCC two years later
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:55.420]   and won again with this brand new thing,
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:59.020]   just shedding the snakeskin or shedding the old shell.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:02.780]   It's such a beautiful example of pushing one's limits
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:06.340]   as a way of life, not being stuck in old mental models.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:08.620]   Breaking new ground as a way of life, dynamic quality.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:09.460]   That's what it takes.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:10.900]   - And so hard for people to do.
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:12.700]   I think about Michael Jordan and the fact
[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:14.380]   that he wanted to be a pro baseball player.
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:17.940]   So he had a brief stint at that and it was underwhelming,
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:19.660]   certainly compared to his basketball career.
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:24.100]   But of course his basketball career was so spectacular
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:27.300]   that the expectation wasn't there.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:32.180]   But nonetheless, it's so rare to find people
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:37.100]   that are super successful repeatedly within domain,
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:38.540]   let alone across domains.
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:40.420]   It's just- - Yeah.
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:43.860]   Richard Feynman, yeah, he could paint a little bit
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:45.900]   and draw a little bit, but I don't know.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:47.740]   I've seen those pictures of the roosters.
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:51.300]   They're kind of first-year art school.
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:52.140]   So it's cool.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:53.620]   Like, cool, he learned to draw and paint,
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:56.940]   but he weren't like, if his name wasn't on them,
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:58.420]   like no one would care.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:02.820]   - Well, Jordan had just an incredible competitive drive,
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:03.900]   incredible competitive drive.
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:06.620]   And like the amount of, like, it's very hard
[02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:08.460]   to replicate success in an art
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:09.820]   because one that shouldn't replicate,
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:13.340]   one should drive to rediscover, right?
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:17.700]   It's like a recreation of something new, not old, right?
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:21.980]   I think the impulse once one wins
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.900]   is to do what one did before.
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:26.060]   But the world changes.
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:27.820]   Like one of the gifts the Celtics have this year
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:30.260]   is that everyone is targeting us, right?
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.700]   'Cause we're the champions.
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:32.620]   Like we won it last year.
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:36.420]   And so everyone brings like an extra 30% every night,
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:39.980]   every team, and the NBA is stacked with brilliant athletes.
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:42.380]   Even the lower level teams from the outside in
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:44.140]   are filled with amazing athletes who,
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:46.780]   if you're the game of the week or the month for them,
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.900]   they bring it all.
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.340]   So all of our weaknesses are being exposed,
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:51.820]   which is what we want, right?
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.900]   And so you have, there's growing pains.
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:55.300]   You work through it all.
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:57.220]   And so the good thing about the competitive,
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:01.500]   truth-telling world is that our competitors,
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:05.460]   our rivals help force us to take our shit on,
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.180]   which makes it very hard to sit in static quality
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:09.540]   unless we're happy with mediocrity.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:13.060]   Like the Celtics have, you know, one of the most,
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.060]   Joe Mazula is the head coach of the Boston Celtics,
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:17.100]   and he's one of, he and I are dear friends.
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.860]   And for the last two and a half years or so,
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:23.680]   we've been thought partners and brothers in this journey.
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:28.000]   And I've never seen anyone in my life better
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.520]   at turning weaknesses into strengths than Joe,
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.500]   which is a huge statement,
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:35.700]   'cause I spent my life with these all-in performers.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:38.220]   Not taking weaknesses and like making them less weak
[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:39.460]   or like leveling them out,
[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:41.220]   but turning like an area of core weakness
[02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:42.820]   into a core power zone.
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:44.180]   That's a superpower.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:45.380]   And that's something that Joe,
[02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:46.980]   Joe trains harder than anybody else.
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:50.420]   And he leads by example, and he leads with vulnerability.
[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:53.600]   And there's something, he embodies dynamic quality.
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:54.940]   And that's really special.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:57.500]   And that's something I have unbelievable respect for.
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:05:58.340]   And you look at Joe now,
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:00.980]   like Joe just has learned to just thrive in pain
[02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:04.940]   and discomfort in his limits,
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:06.260]   in living at his limits.
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.380]   And that's like the leadership,
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:11.020]   which I think will lead to beautiful things.
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:14.460]   - So I feel like there are at least three components
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:16.460]   to what you're describing.
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:19.920]   One is that, you know, maybe in this pre-conscious phase,
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:24.180]   people are thinking about what they have to gain
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.020]   from this process that they're in.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:27.340]   And the process is natural,
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:29.340]   at least to the extent that they're motivated to do it.
[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:30.420]   It comes from some source.
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:32.460]   This seems to be the stage and the thing
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:34.480]   that Rick Rubin is trying to tap into
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:36.220]   in the artists that he works with,
[02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:37.660]   whether or not they're established or new.
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:39.600]   It's that, it's the identification
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:41.740]   of that pre-conscious energy,
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:44.860]   which is so pure and so beautiful by definition.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:48.340]   As opposed to the second thing,
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:51.140]   which is when people have something to lose.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.780]   You know, they went from poverty
[02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:54.100]   to having a really nice home.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.260]   They bought their mom a home.
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.660]   They're loving this life and they don't wanna lose it.
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:00.420]   They don't wanna go back to where they were before,
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:01.740]   even though where they were before
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:05.020]   probably played a key role in that pre-conscious state
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:07.180]   that allowed them to get to that next level
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:11.080]   versus something to protect.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:15.060]   And, you know, trying to not lose everything you've got
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:17.820]   is very different than trying to protect
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.460]   certain elements of what one has.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:21.940]   So like in terms of the Celtics,
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:25.580]   they hold the championship title now.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:28.320]   So they have something to lose, frankly.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.180]   They could not get it again, but it's in the record books.
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:35.020]   So it's nuanced, right?
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:40.020]   It's not like in a fight you can get knocked out or worse,
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:43.900]   but you're still a champion if you were a champion once.
[02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:45.980]   I mean, certain fields are like that.
[02:07:45.980 --> 02:07:47.020]   - Well, going back to back
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:50.820]   is an approach way of framing that.
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:51.940]   Like going back to back is different
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:53.120]   from protecting the title.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:56.420]   - Right, 'cause then the words like reigning champions,
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:57.260]   you know, it's like,
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:58.700]   "Oh, you're already the reigning champion."
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:01.980]   Or you think about dynasties.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:02.820]   Like I grew up in the,
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:05.780]   when the 49ers were like kind of in multiple dynasties,
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:08.300]   it was like the Joe Montana era and the Steve Young era.
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:09.780]   And like, you know, like these dynasties
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:12.540]   where they were just considered such an important team
[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:15.660]   overall because of how long they were able
[02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:18.220]   to do what they did, the Bulls, right?
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:22.620]   You know, so Tiger Woods, right?
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:25.620]   And there seems to be a kind of obsession with this process,
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:26.860]   at least in the United States,
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.740]   where we love to see the rise of somebody
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:34.220]   from, you know, ignominy to fame or rags to riches.
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:35.900]   And then, but there also seems to be
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:38.860]   this kind of obsession with their fall, their demise,
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:39.960]   and then coming back again.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.220]   And I think the most, you know,
[02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:46.100]   prominent example of this in my mind is Mike Tyson,
[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:48.180]   whose life is like, as a friend described,
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:51.660]   is almost Shakespearean in the way that he came from nothing,
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:53.500]   then youngest heavyweight champion,
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:56.100]   then all these issues, you know, legal and financial,
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:59.460]   then back again, and now he seems to be in kind of,
[02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:01.280]   he's at least of a level of status
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.880]   where he can wear his own shirt
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:03.980]   and no one thinks it's weird.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:04.820]   It actually looks cool.
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:07.660]   He's probably the only guy who can wear a shirt
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.260]   with his own name on it.
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:11.140]   And he just, and it just seems right.
[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:13.000]   Like he earned that one, you know?
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.860]   And I think ironically it was the hangover.
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:17.060]   It was him pretending to have a, you know,
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:19.300]   as an actor that kind of brought him back
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.140]   as a lovable character.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:21.980]   It's kind of interesting.
[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:24.740]   Like he seems to now be on the Mount Rushmore of,
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:30.140]   you know, famous American athletes who, you know,
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:32.500]   like I only wish the best for him,
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:37.500]   but whatever happens next, like that, it's cemented.
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:38.820]   His legacy is cemented.
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:40.700]   At some point people's legacy is cemented.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.420]   And I wonder how that feels too.
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:44.180]   So maybe we could talk about these different stages
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:46.420]   of the sine wave that hopefully is upward
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:47.500]   and drifting right.
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.020]   - One of the things that I,
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:52.940]   that's very difficult in modern society
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:55.120]   and in the life of a professional athlete or team
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.260]   in modern society is that, you know,
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:58.500]   you think about NBA players,
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:01.540]   they're always being interviewed by the media
[02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:05.260]   and the media is always trying to drum up drama
[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:07.580]   and always trying to ask.
[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:10.360]   The media always asks the question
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.700]   that is exactly what the performance psychologist
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:15.900]   of the player would not want the player to think about.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:19.540]   So for example, like they might ask something about like,
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:20.900]   how do you feel knowing you can,
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:22.860]   the expectations of you are so large
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:24.800]   you can never live up to them, right?
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:26.940]   Like, or is it shameful?
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:28.980]   Do you feel ashamed about your performance now
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:30.700]   because of the expectations on you?
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:32.100]   The questions like that will be framed.
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:33.720]   - Or your wife is eight months pregnant.
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:35.660]   Like, how do you feel being, you know,
[02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:37.660]   5,000 miles away right now?
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:39.340]   - That would be pretty benign compared to, right?
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:40.860]   - Yeah, it's like, thanks, you know.
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:41.980]   - Right, there's something because like,
[02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:44.340]   you want a player to be liberated from self-consciousness.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:46.860]   You don't want a player to be playing with an awareness
[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:51.140]   or a fixation on external expectations or the external eye.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:53.220]   One, like I remember the feeling in my chess life
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:56.140]   when I transitioned from losing myself in thought
[02:10:56.140 --> 02:11:00.540]   to thinking about how I looked thinking to the cameras
[02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:02.660]   or the groupies or whatever on the outside,
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:06.780]   like wildly different mindsets as a chess player, right?
[02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:08.820]   And so you have all these pressures
[02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:09.940]   that are trying to pull you
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:12.460]   out of an ideal performance state.
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:14.580]   And so one needs to learn, develop thick skin
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:17.020]   or a way of integrating it or be playful with it.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:20.500]   And I really believe in embracing adversity.
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.820]   We have this theme of hunting adversity on the team,
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:27.260]   which is like these things that could be seen
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:31.140]   as detrimental or, you know, problems
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:34.100]   or things that could get in the way of our liberation
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:36.880]   is where we welcome them, like cold water, right?
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.180]   Getting in cold water every day is a very important,
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:42.220]   I think it's a beautiful opportunity to train it so much.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:43.460]   But we don't want to get in cold water,
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:44.540]   gritting our teeth and hating it.
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:46.100]   No, we want to like love the fact
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:48.060]   that we're about to suffer in that cold water.
[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:49.900]   I've been cold plunging for, you know,
[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:52.020]   many, many years, maybe 15 years.
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:55.900]   And like, it's not like when you get into 34 degree water,
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:57.320]   even if you've been training for a very long time,
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:58.820]   you're thrilled about this five minute
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:00.700]   or 10 minute plunge you're about to do.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:04.560]   - The most consistent stimulus for adrenaline release
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:06.980]   and noradrenaline release in the brain
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:09.500]   that is safe if done properly.
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:10.340]   - Right.
[02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:12.660]   - And you never really habituate.
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:15.540]   I maybe would just really quickly double click
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:18.140]   on this thing of cold plunging.
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:19.860]   I don't go for time.
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:22.700]   I think only in terms of walls of adrenaline.
[02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:26.300]   So some days like just getting in the thing is a big wall.
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:28.980]   I think that just for lack of a better word, there's a wall.
[02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:31.840]   On a hot day, I'm happy to get into the cold plunge.
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.680]   - Yeah.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.240]   - But then what I think is so valuable about cold plunging
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.180]   is that if you start to focus
[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:40.400]   on what neuroscientists call interoception,
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:42.180]   everything, our perception of everything
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:43.580]   from our skin inward,
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:45.980]   you can start to feel the deployment of adrenaline
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:48.220]   in your body, or at least its effects.
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:50.140]   And you can say, here's another wall of adrenaline.
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:51.940]   You watch your frame rate go up,
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:54.500]   the impulse to stay still, because as you move,
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.700]   you break up that thermal layer, it gets even colder.
[02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:58.860]   But then you also want to get out.
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:00.420]   And then that wall passes.
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:01.540]   And then you start to notice
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:03.820]   that the distance between the walls changes.
[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:05.660]   And then playing with that in one's mind,
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:10.260]   as when I distract myself, the walls come suddenly,
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:12.100]   or when I'm focused on the walls,
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.720]   they seem like big swells,
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.640]   as opposed to when I relax myself,
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:20.060]   they seem like just like kind of more sharp peaks.
[02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:21.980]   And learning that those dynamics
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:26.100]   of how adrenaline impacts us cognitively,
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:27.140]   and frame rate and all that,
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.140]   I think is an immensely valuable practice.
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:30.620]   And I can't think of anything else,
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.520]   not sprinting, not lifting weights,
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:36.220]   not real life arguments, because that can be destructive.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:38.900]   I can't think of any other kind of venue
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:41.860]   for exploring one's ability to work through stress
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:44.820]   and tension than the cold plunge.
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:45.660]   - I agree.
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:47.280]   I have this principle I call
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:49.120]   living on the other side of pain.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:50.800]   And I think that pain,
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:53.680]   like mental discomfort, physical discomfort,
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:56.880]   or confronting some issue one doesn't want to think about,
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:59.200]   or taking on one's bias pattern,
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.640]   or if you're, let's just say,
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.120]   like a professional decision maker,
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:06.440]   taking on what the network of your cognitive biases
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.000]   tends to lead to.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.800]   Like these are all forms of pain, right?
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:12.760]   I think the cold water training is such an exquisite way
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:14.560]   to practice living on the other side of pain
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:17.380]   in a way that is thematically resonant.
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:18.720]   And you can train at that,
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:21.340]   doing that physical practice can liberate you
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:25.300]   in your mental arenas to take on shit
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:26.420]   you don't want to take on.
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:27.900]   One thing I've found is that
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:29.860]   when you're training peak performers,
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:33.140]   there can be the impulse to go right at their weakness
[02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:35.940]   in the place they're making the error.
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:39.860]   But it's usually much less potent to do it that way
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:42.180]   because they're well calloused over in that area.
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:44.380]   So if you're like a poker player who has,
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:46.740]   like I said, some control issue, right?
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:50.640]   It's, you could like take on the control issue in poker,
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:51.920]   but they're so brilliant at poker,
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.480]   like they've built calluses around it,
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:55.320]   they've built ways of dealing with it,
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:56.840]   and they're able to play at a high level despite,
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:59.120]   but like, but they're probably very controlling at home
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:02.600]   as well with their spouse or their kids or whatever.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.920]   And if you take on the control issues
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:05.780]   in places they're much less developed,
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:07.080]   it'll be much easier to take it on
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:08.720]   'cause it's less calloused,
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:11.060]   and it will be massively liberating in their poker game.
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:13.000]   So I often, like this is this connect,
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.240]   this idea of interconnectedness
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.620]   and thematic interconnectedness.
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:18.320]   I'll identify a theme someone needs to work with,
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.540]   but then we'll practice that theme
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:22.320]   in other areas of their life.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:23.960]   And then you could have core habits
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:25.040]   which manifest that theme,
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:26.320]   and then there comes this amazing moment
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:29.160]   where the theme just becomes like internalized
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:30.640]   because one practices it in things
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.760]   that are away from where it manifests professionally.
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.160]   And then it just releases,
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:36.080]   and then all the manifestations of that theme
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.640]   just become your way of life.
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:41.000]   So for example, like if one wants to take on
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.400]   one's resistance to discomfort, to pain,
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:46.040]   to pushing one's limits, right?
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:48.040]   One can practice things like cold plunging,
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:49.960]   like cardiovascular interval training,
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:54.320]   like other things like withholding orgasm, whatever.
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.400]   You can have ways of practicing
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:01.960]   like the theme that are completely separate
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:04.520]   from where it's manifesting or hindering you
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:05.600]   in your professional life
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:07.200]   where you're probably very good at dealing with it,
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:09.280]   and then the unlock will just happen,
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:11.040]   and you'll be liberated from it, right?
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.280]   This is one of the most powerful ways
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.060]   that I've found to train.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:16.520]   I also find cold plunging is just unbelievable
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:21.280]   for sleep quality, for, I do contrast training now.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:23.440]   And I agree with you, like I've spent a lot,
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:25.480]   for years I was doing like really long,
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:29.840]   cold, like 36 degree water for 11 or 12 minutes,
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.520]   and I pushed myself really hard.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:35.120]   And man, 11 minutes is so different from nine minutes.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:36.880]   Oh, different world.
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.540]   And now I found that like I have a practice
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:45.540]   of I'll do three to four rounds of 42 to 44 degrees
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:48.200]   between that and the sauna,
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:50.080]   and I'll do like one longer plunge a week.
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:51.200]   But like in daily practice,
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.360]   I don't feel the urge to do very long breath holds
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:58.280]   or very long cold plunges, I don't necessarily.
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:01.320]   - Yeah, same, I'll do cold plunge for one to three minutes,
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:03.720]   and I love contrast with heat.
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:04.560]   - Oh, so beautiful.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.400]   - I'm very heat tolerant, I love, love, love the sauna.
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:09.880]   I don't love the cold,
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:12.160]   but I love the long arc of dopamine
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:14.240]   that comes after the cold.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.200]   I always say, no one really enjoys being in the thing.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:18.320]   You'd be feel-
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:19.800]   - Is there a better sleep hack?
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:21.460]   I'm asking you, 'cause you know this stuff.
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:23.260]   - Well, there is supplements that could support sleep
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:24.100]   and that kind of thing,
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:26.840]   and people learning how to deliberately relax their body
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.280]   can help with the transition to sleep and back to sleep.
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:31.160]   But, you know, one core principle
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:32.760]   that I haven't really talked about on the podcast
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:35.040]   is that if you, the more adrenaline,
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:37.960]   nor epinephrine, nor adrenaline,
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:39.900]   and dopamine that you experience early in the day,
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.720]   as well as cortisol from bright light,
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:44.600]   exercise, caffeine, and cold,
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:46.040]   the better you're gonna sleep at night.
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:47.800]   It also sets your circadian rhythm
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:52.800]   around kind of like a big set of arousal,
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:54.460]   promoting stimuli early in the day,
[02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:56.720]   and then, you know, last third of your day,
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:58.720]   you're very parasympathetic,
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.220]   for lack of a better way to put it,
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:02.080]   and that eases the transition to sleep.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.280]   I mean, you know, dimming the lights,
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.560]   parasympathetic, bright lights,
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.960]   increases the amount of cortisol
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.120]   with your morning cortisol pulse by 50%, five zero,
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:11.140]   which is great.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:14.140]   Keeps you less susceptible to infection all day,
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:14.980]   these kinds of things.
[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:17.560]   I mean, we're meant to be in oscillation,
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:19.200]   obviously, across the 24-hour cycle,
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:21.080]   but even within the day.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:21.960]   It's a little bit tougher
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.500]   when people have evening activities,
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.400]   or you put, like last night,
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:28.280]   I was watching these guys play a hard game of basketball
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:31.000]   at, you know, eight to 10 p.m.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.840]   That's a lot of late-night work.
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:33.800]   - And we're on the West Coast.
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:36.040]   You can think what time that is East Coast time, right?
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:36.880]   - Right, right.
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:37.920]   So is there a better sleep stack?
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:38.760]   Not really.
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:40.040]   I mean, and if you want to increase
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:42.400]   your rapid eye movement sleep non-pharmacologically,
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.720]   I would say, meaning not exogenous pharmacology,
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:46.920]   yeah, the cold plunge in the morning,
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:47.760]   early part of the day.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:52.760]   For evening, anything that moves blood out to your periphery,
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:57.800]   so sauna, pot shower, that sort of thing,
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:18:59.240]   is gonna drop your core body temperature
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:00.700]   when you get out, right?
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:02.020]   It's a little paradoxical to people,
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:04.240]   but you know, you warm up to then cool off
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:05.480]   at the level of core body temperature,
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:07.680]   and it'll ease the transition to sleep.
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:09.840]   Yeah, it's a wonderful practice.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:11.600]   And people who pick at cold plunging,
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:13.360]   they're like, "Well, it blocks hypertrophy."
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:14.840]   Okay, yeah, okay, that's true.
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.000]   So in the six hours after you're trying to get your,
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]   you know, a little more peak on your biceps or something,
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:19.900]   it's gonna block that.
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:23.000]   But most people have not experienced control
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.080]   over their physiology at the level
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:28.280]   that comes from doing consistent cold plunging
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.800]   in the early part of the day,
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:32.720]   warming up and becoming more parasympathetic
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:34.080]   later in the day.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.120]   It's like, they start to feel a level of control
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:38.920]   over their mood and energy that's so striking
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:41.640]   with basically zero cost tools.
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:42.480]   - Yeah, I agree.
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:43.720]   - Yeah, sorry to riff on that,
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.060]   but people will probably wonder about specifics.
[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:51.440]   I wanna make sure that we talk about two things,
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:55.240]   and you can decide which one to talk about first.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:58.120]   One is ego, and then the second one is,
[02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:02.240]   earlier you described a set of dynamics across the day
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:04.600]   and some concrete things about, you know,
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:06.760]   how one picks the most important question,
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:09.240]   like, "What am I working on today?"
[02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:13.420]   And how to kind of push that into certain portions
[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:14.760]   of the day, how long to do that,
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:18.160]   and then how to, you know, stay out of stimulus and response
[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:21.000]   in the transition point so that you can make the most
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.640]   of that work or extract the most from that work
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:26.640]   as you head into the evening dinner with your family,
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:28.800]   sleep, and then wake up, repeat.
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:30.480]   Which one do you think would be most valuable?
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:32.160]   - Games go wherever you wanna go, where should we go?
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:34.360]   - All right, before we get practical,
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:38.720]   let's get a little bit more theoretical,
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:42.060]   and then get back to practical.
[02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:46.560]   Ego, like the constriction is what comes to mind,
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:49.520]   like the idea that, like, I wanna impose my will
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:53.000]   on something, I want a certain outcome,
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.360]   and if I don't get it, it's gonna hurt in some way,
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:58.160]   there's some punishment mechanism internally,
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:00.880]   like, that might drive me to work even harder,
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:02.240]   it's not always bad.
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:04.640]   But how do you frame ego?
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:09.640]   And I will say that the words I am seem very important,
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:14.320]   like when people identify as I am the champion,
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:16.760]   I'm part of a champion team in the NBA,
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:19.560]   I'm a Celtic, you know, I'm a player,
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:22.280]   you know, I'm a Celtics player, clearly I'm not.
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:26.700]   But, you know, when we attach identity to ego,
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:29.400]   that's also where it seems like
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:31.200]   it kinda deepens the trench a bit.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:32.560]   But maybe it can be more relaxed
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:33.640]   than the way I'm describing it.
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.160]   How do you think about ego?
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:37.800]   - We had, so Graham Duncan, my dear friend,
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:39.400]   joined us at the game last night,
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.080]   and Graham, I consider to be in the realm
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:46.000]   of, like, elite mental talent mapping and assessment
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.120]   to just be in the league of his own.
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:51.800]   He's such a genius in the realm of just finding
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:56.800]   and, like, identifying people who have world-class
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:59.880]   potential in mental arenas in really quirky ways.
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:02.080]   He's a beautiful soul.
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:06.680]   And one of the ways he frames this in the investment space
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:09.400]   when he's looking at high-potential investors
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:12.240]   is, like, he doesn't want to find people
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:14.360]   who have too specific an identity
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:17.640]   in the way that they relate to what they do,
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:19.820]   to make money, to invest, to whatever.
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:22.800]   Because, like, there's something static
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:25.820]   in, like, I am a X, Y, or Z,
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:27.760]   versus I am something more broad,
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:30.480]   which leads to one's relationship
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:32.520]   to, like, dynamic quality, to rediscovery,
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.100]   to changing as the world changes, right?
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:39.440]   I think that, and this relates a little bit
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:41.640]   to what I was describing in terms of learning chess locally
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:43.900]   versus learning chess in a way that connects
[02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:46.640]   to all of life, which is so dynamic.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.940]   I think, and I spent many years studying
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:53.160]   Ayamaka Buddha's philosophy,
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:57.400]   and so I come from both a Western and Eastern perspective
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:22:59.240]   when I think about the question of ego.
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:01.520]   And I think that one of the things that happens in the West
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.240]   when we talk about East Asian philosophy
[02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:04.800]   is that we oversimplify it,
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:08.120]   and we create, we kind of polarize things.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:09.860]   And I think, so it's easy to,
[02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:12.400]   people talk so quickly about being egoless, right,
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:14.440]   or say someone is low-ego.
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:15.880]   And when they say they're low-ego,
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:17.440]   they don't actually mean that they're low-ego.
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:19.480]   They mean that they have a sound egoic structure,
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:23.280]   like they're not, like if they say they're low-ego,
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.200]   they're usually saying that they are,
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.800]   they're not expressing insecurity all the time,
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:32.760]   which means that it's not that they have a low ego.
[02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:37.520]   It's that their ego is not fundamentally,
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:38.800]   like there's not a rupture in the structure
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:40.200]   that's leaking all the time.
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:45.400]   So the way I relate to ego
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:47.440]   from a competitive perspective
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:50.040]   or from an artistic perspective
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:52.080]   or a self-cultivation perspective
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:57.080]   is that I relate to it around dynamic versus static,
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:59.760]   constant exploration as opposed to being stuck
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.360]   in how one relates to old patterns.
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:04.080]   I relate to understanding the emptiness
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.400]   of our egoic dynamics,
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:11.400]   understanding the non-absolute nature of our ego,
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:13.760]   the relational nature of things,
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:15.920]   the interconnectedness and the interdependence
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:17.120]   of all things.
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:18.840]   I think it's so easy to have an identity
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:20.600]   which we think is like I am this,
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:22.760]   but we're not this.
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:25.000]   This doesn't exist out of relation to that,
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000]   and that doesn't relate in relation to this other thing.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.460]   So understanding the chain of relationality
[02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:33.680]   and then how our ego manifests in all of that.
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:37.120]   So having the ability to both dissolve one's relationship
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:40.120]   to like static egoic dynamics,
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.240]   but also having a sense of identity.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:45.960]   And having a sense of what one's self-expression is,
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.880]   and having like when we are,
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:50.240]   there is this thing about will.
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:51.520]   Like when you're competing,
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:54.720]   like you can feel when someone has an unbreakable will.
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.320]   Like when you're matching up against somebody
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.120]   and they're wishy-washy,
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:24:59.920]   you can just blow through them.
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:03.760]   But when their will is just like,
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:05.520]   like I'll never forget Marcello Garcia
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.480]   against Calassans in a big world championship match.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:10.920]   Calassans was wrist-locking everybody,
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.000]   and Marcello put his hand right into the wrist-lock
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.040]   and looked into his eyes.
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:15.560]   It's like, "Try it."
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:17.840]   He just put his hand into it.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:21.280]   And you can break someone by being unbreakable.
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.400]   You can see a lot of fights
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:23.860]   where somebody tries to submit someone
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:27.020]   and someone is unsubmitted,
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.160]   and the person who has the huge advantage gets broken
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.400]   because they realize, "Holy shit, this guy is unbreakable."
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:33.440]   And so they become broken, right?
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:35.840]   So there's having the ability to have that like,
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:38.760]   when you touch a fighter,
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:40.880]   like fighters all rub up against each other.
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:43.000]   You learn a lot feeling someone.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.320]   So if you meet fighters that hug,
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:45.160]   they'll give each other,
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:47.720]   you learn so much on the touch, you know?
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.160]   And you can feel when someone is brittle.
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:54.600]   You touch them, you can feel how much contact they've taken,
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:56.740]   how much they've been hit, how much they've absorbed,
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:59.480]   how much they've been abused, how much they've received.
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:01.460]   And you can feel where their energy stops.
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:06.360]   You can feel if there's just static things in them.
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:07.780]   And then you can also feel
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:10.000]   when the earth is moving inside of them,
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.640]   when it's just like this molten energy
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:12.480]   is just moving in them.
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.260]   And when you feel a body that like,
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:17.020]   like it just can envelop you,
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:21.440]   and it can be a mountain or it can be like water.
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:22.760]   So I relate to ego in that.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:25.280]   You wanna be able to be like water and be like a mountain.
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:28.200]   I've never answered that question before.
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:29.280]   I just riffed on that.
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:31.000]   But that's like the essence of how I relate to it.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.920]   - I mean, and as I walked in here
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:34.080]   to take a seat at my chair,
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:36.000]   I got a good hard slap on the back from you,
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000]   and I was wondering if you were testing me.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.880]   - I felt you last night too.
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:43.860]   - I won't ask what your read of my ego was,
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:47.160]   but I felt it as a slap of camaraderie.
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:50.020]   Like, let's do this, which felt great.
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:51.280]   And I was also thinking about my good friend,
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:54.800]   Lex Friedman, who is a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:56.680]   and a very intense guy
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.520]   who wears his heart on his sleeve publicly.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:01.760]   And people sometimes will take shots at him for that,
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:02.640]   which really upsets me.
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:03.720]   - I really respect Lex.
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:05.080]   I think what he does is awesome.
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:06.760]   I love his podcast.
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:07.600]   - He's brilliant.
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:10.960]   - And the way he, in really prickly issues,
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:13.520]   has got people on both sides of things
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.200]   and welcomes everyone in and has dialogue,
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:16.460]   I have a huge amount of respect
[02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:19.560]   for how Lex handles himself in the public world.
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.280]   - Yeah, you guys are gonna have a fun conversation.
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:23.200]   He's gonna be jealous
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:24.560]   that we got a chance to sit down here.
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:29.560]   But Lex is at home and with his friends
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:32.880]   exactly how he appears to be.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:37.000]   Like, all that intense self-torture
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.520]   around what to do and how to frame something,
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:40.960]   who to talk to, how to talk to them,
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:44.440]   and that's the world he lives in.
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:47.320]   And, but in terms of his physicality,
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:49.440]   like, I think it's hard to understand,
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:52.560]   like, just how, I mean, like,
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.680]   he's, like, dense like dark matter, you know?
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:57.200]   Like, it's the, and I think a lot of guys
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:59.440]   that roll jiu-jitsu, like, you shake their hands
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:02.800]   and, like, there's a solidity there
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:07.160]   that's very different than just muscle.
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:09.520]   It's, like, people that are just, like,
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:11.960]   they're used to being up against bodies, apparently,
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:14.840]   you know, so it's an experience, you know?
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.540]   These are subtle things, but clearly they matter.
[02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:21.060]   And as you've pointed out,
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:23.120]   one brings them to their professional life.
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:24.680]   You bring it to friendships.
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:25.700]   You know, I can't think of,
[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:28.320]   I have many super, quote, unquote, solid friends,
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:31.080]   but Lex is among the most solid of them.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:32.640]   He's just, like, his presence.
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:34.000]   - Yeah. - He has a courageousness
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.200]   with which he, in my observation from afar,
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:38.440]   comports himself in the world
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:40.440]   that I have a lot of respect for.
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:42.980]   - And Rick Rubin, you know, we both know Rick,
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:47.880]   and people know Rick as this bearded icon of creativity.
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:50.060]   And he is indeed that.
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:54.260]   The fluidity that he moves through life with is just,
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:55.960]   it's, like, it's astonishing.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.220]   I've spent a lot of time with him,
[02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:00.040]   and I don't wanna, like, get into my observations of Rick,
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:01.940]   the Rickisms, if you will,
[02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:06.940]   but it's astonishing how much attention
[02:29:06.940 --> 02:29:11.480]   and he puts into creating this thing
[02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:12.520]   that we're talking about, space,
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:14.640]   like getting out of stimulus and response.
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:16.120]   It's, I don't think he'd mind me sharing this.
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:18.240]   It's not uncommon for me to, like, go over
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:19.920]   to hang out with him, and he'll just say, like,
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:22.800]   "Hey, like, before we, like, talk,
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:24.760]   you wanna just, like, do this meditation?"
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:26.040]   And we'll just, like, sit there and meditate.
[02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:28.200]   And you quickly go into a mindset of, like,
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:30.120]   "Oh my goodness, like, this is, like, a thing."
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:33.920]   But, like, nope, you just get into being present.
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:35.780]   And then, I don't know, then you hang out,
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:38.580]   and you talk about, if you're us, you know, the Ramones,
[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:39.880]   'cause we both love the Ramones.
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:43.860]   Yeah, so I love the way you frame ego.
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.620]   I think that that's very helpful
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:50.700]   because a physical embodiment of something
[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:54.300]   that is largely psychological to most people,
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:57.260]   at least the concept, I think is very helpful.
[02:29:57.260 --> 02:29:59.040]   Do you ever, just as a practice,
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:02.700]   just look at how people walk, or how they interact?
[02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:05.380]   - Oh, yeah, I mean, of course, that's my way of life.
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:07.900]   I mean, it's funny, as a chess player, even,
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:10.140]   like, I used to study people off the board all the time.
[02:30:10.140 --> 02:30:12.220]   I'd watch them, like, you watch,
[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:14.700]   I remember you used to play these tournaments in Bermuda,
[02:30:14.700 --> 02:30:17.500]   and once a year, invitational, like, high-level tournament,
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:19.460]   and then, like, you'd watch someone walking,
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:21.140]   and they'd get caught in the rain.
[02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:24.820]   And you, watching someone in the rain, you learn so much.
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:26.900]   Like, would they just stand and embrace it?
[02:30:26.900 --> 02:30:29.040]   Would they put something over their head and run away?
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:29.880]   What would they do, right?
[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:34.360]   Like, and in general, if someone has a static,
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:36.140]   like, a negative relation to the rain,
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:37.480]   they're usually pretty controlling,
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:39.600]   and then you have a feel for how to handle them on the board,
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:41.160]   create chaos on that board.
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:43.680]   Like, just mix it up, make it uncontrollable.
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:46.600]   And then, or if someone is, like, full free spirit
[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:50.840]   in the rain, like me, like, maybe you wanna make the game,
[02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:53.520]   like, a little bit more quiet, conservative,
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.800]   like, strategic, not so chaotic,
[02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:59.980]   like, where one has to find exact, precise solutions
[02:30:59.980 --> 02:31:01.720]   in specific kinds of positions,
[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:03.200]   where, like, you can't improvise.
[02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:04.800]   You're not finding hidden harmonies in chaos.
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:07.320]   You're finding specific thing, right?
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:10.080]   Control in rain.
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:11.760]   And then, in the fight game, man,
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:13.400]   you're watching people all the time.
[02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:15.920]   I mean, you watch fighters watching one another.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.240]   You see a lot.
[02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:19.460]   Feeling one another, watching one another.
[02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:22.440]   And I love watching people away from what they do,
[02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:26.040]   'cause all those themes are much more visible
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:28.460]   than in when they're doing what they do.
[02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:31.400]   - What about in non-competitive endeavors,
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:36.400]   like ballet, opera, music,
[02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:39.280]   where certainly it's competitive in that, you know,
[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:41.440]   you're competing for people's attention, time, and money,
[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:44.420]   but you're not, it's not direct competition.
[02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:46.920]   Do you spend time working with key performers
[02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:50.160]   in these domains where, you know, like,
[02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:53.120]   just, I heard from someone recently who,
[02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.520]   she said, "You know, I'm a good dancer,
[02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:56.240]   but then I went to New York and I discovered
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.800]   that I'm not such a good dancer."
[02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:00.780]   Like, the level of who gets to actually dance
[02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:02.200]   in some of the premier venues there
[02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:04.820]   is, like, so unbelievably high that,
[02:32:04.820 --> 02:32:07.800]   and by the way, that shouldn't discourage anyone.
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:11.240]   That should encourage people, show them what's possible.
[02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:12.400]   Do you work with people like that,
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:14.200]   or is it usually competitive arenas?
[02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:17.080]   - I've utilized competitive fields
[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:20.800]   as beautiful laboratories for refining
[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:22.560]   my relationship to the training process
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:24.320]   because of how relentlessly truth-telling they are,
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.320]   but I also come from a family of artists.
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:27.760]   My grandmother was a brilliant
[02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:30.360]   abstract expressionist painter and sculptor,
[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:32.360]   Stella Waitzkin, amazing woman.
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:33.800]   She was in the, she was good friends
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:37.000]   with Hans Hoffman and Kooning and Jackson Pollock.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:37.840]   I mean, that was her crowd.
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:40.800]   She was part of the, like, the early beat generation
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:44.160]   back in the day, and I come from a family of artists,
[02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:49.160]   and yeah, I mean, one of the, you know,
[02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:52.240]   a lot of what I'm thinking about in recent years
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:53.960]   is how to channel my life's work
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:58.680]   into making the biggest positive impact
[02:32:58.680 --> 02:33:01.480]   possible in the world, and I'm really worried
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:04.480]   in this moment around what's happening
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:07.520]   in human consciousness, the depths of distraction.
[02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:11.520]   How can we enhance the human ability
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:14.520]   to make decisions in an increasingly complex world
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:17.240]   where there's so much misinformation,
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:19.160]   and also, you know, how can we,
[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:21.120]   how can we take on humanity's biggest challenges?
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:22.480]   And so, for example, one of the projects
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:24.400]   that I'm really excited about
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.200]   that I've been working on for the last couple years
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:29.440]   is called Lila Science, and these aren't competitors.
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:32.480]   These are scientists, and we're essentially,
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:35.480]   we've, so I was sitting with this question
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:37.720]   for two or three years, like,
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:42.360]   who should I partner with to try to take
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:44.640]   on humanity's biggest challenges?
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:46.440]   And I met this guy.
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:48.920]   He ended up renting Graham's house,
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:51.080]   who we were at the game with yesterday,
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:53.360]   next door to mine in Costa Rica,
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:55.440]   and his name is Jeff Van Montzel,
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.560]   and Jeff is a, just a brilliant
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.000]   scientific visionary and creator,
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.220]   and we ended up having three weeks of dialogue,
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:07.840]   and I incidentally, like, invested
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:09.400]   in one of his companies years before,
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.080]   which was interesting, but we had, like,
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:12.680]   this incredible three weeks of dialogue
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:13.720]   while he was standing next door,
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:14.560]   and then we looked at each other
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:16.400]   and realized we should be teaming up,
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:20.320]   and we've, and I've also been very close to
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:23.120]   and observing the world of artificial intelligence
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:27.200]   for a long time, partially because Demis Hassabis
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.440]   was a childhood friend of mine.
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:30.600]   We grew up playing chess together
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:32.040]   from when we were, like, 11 years old,
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:34.960]   and so I've observed his journey,
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:39.960]   and I think that it's very interesting in chess,
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:44.780]   like, the seat that I had watching
[02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:48.740]   the impact on chess of, first, computers,
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.040]   increasingly powerful machines,
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:52.940]   and then artificial intelligence was fascinating,
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:55.660]   because if you imagine, like, what it's like
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:58.540]   to see one's life's work be overcome
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:00.660]   in three hours of experimentation,
[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:02.860]   like what AlphaZero did, just breathtaking,
[02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:06.100]   and to give some perspective on things,
[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:08.020]   there's an ELO system in chess, right?
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:09.740]   There's a ranking system.
[02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:12.800]   The highest rated chess players in the world,
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:14.200]   human chess players, are rated, you know,
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:16.720]   from Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen, Bobby Fischer,
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:18.160]   all the world champions are rated
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:21.820]   somewhere in the 2800 to 2900 level, right, ELO.
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:27.380]   The strongest AI engines now are north of 3800 ELO,
[02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:29.900]   and just for context of how wild that gap is,
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:33.380]   when I was eight years old, my rating was 1800, right?
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:35.220]   So the gap between me at eight,
[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:36.900]   which is like, I was ridiculous,
[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:39.020]   and the world champion, human,
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:40.780]   is the same gap as the world champion
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:43.260]   and the strongest AI engines in the world.
[02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:45.140]   And so, like, it's very hard for humans
[02:35:45.140 --> 02:35:48.800]   to conceive of being the ants, right,
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:49.900]   relative to the humans.
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:51.460]   We are the ants now, in terms of,
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:53.140]   or we soon will be, what is possible.
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:55.780]   And I think that that could be channeled for the good,
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:57.060]   or it could be channeled for the bad,
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:35:58.740]   and the question, what are the motivations
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:00.340]   of the people who are really driving these companies?
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:01.340]   So I've been thinking for a long time
[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:05.740]   of how to combine, like, what's the light side of the force
[02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:08.060]   of the artificial intelligence world?
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:11.060]   And what Jeff and I, and a dear friend,
[02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:14.620]   Chris Fussell, who is a brilliant man who,
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:16.180]   he wrote "Team of Teams" and "One Mission."
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:18.980]   He was an elite Navy SEAL,
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:19.980]   and then he ended up running
[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:21.340]   Joint Special Operations Command,
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:22.420]   JSOC, with Stan McChrystal,
[02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:23.800]   then he was president of the McChrystal Group,
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:26.780]   and now he's president of Lila Science.
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:29.260]   Jeff, Chris, and I, and a brilliant man named Jack Millwood,
[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:31.900]   who's the chief cultural officer, have been teaming up,
[02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:33.180]   and I brought together this tribe
[02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:36.900]   of a few different brilliant friends who were part of this.
[02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:41.900]   And it's basically taking cutting-edge science
[02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:43.940]   and taking cutting-edge AI,
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:46.100]   bringing them together to create
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:48.060]   scientific superintelligence,
[02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:50.720]   focused on, and we're creating these AI science factories,
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:53.460]   where the entire scientific process can be replicated,
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:55.140]   can be driven nonstop.
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:58.620]   The way AlphaZero was driving nonstop iteration
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:36:59.700]   in the chess world,
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:01.140]   what if this is happening in the scientific process?
[02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:02.980]   - So pose a hypothesis.
[02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:06.380]   Isolate variables, test hypothesis,
[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:09.780]   feedback to hypothesis, confirm or deny hypothesis,
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:11.420]   and just-- - And experimental design,
[02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:12.820]   and experimental execution,
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.500]   and then study of experimental results,
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:17.260]   and then study of the entire scientific literature.
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:20.280]   And imagine all of that happening with robotics,
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:25.280]   with 3,800 ELO-rated scientists, AI scientists,
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:28.080]   and then millions of them networked.
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:30.220]   And now, if you have this, from my perspective,
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:32.180]   the most important thing is the safety, right?
[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:33.820]   And I think that a lot of these AI companies
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:36.460]   aren't prioritizing safety first, we are.
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:38.660]   And I think, for me, it's been a really important thing,
[02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:39.500]   thinking about this,
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:40.320]   'cause I've been sitting with this question
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:41.780]   for a lot of years.
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:43.060]   In order to do something like this,
[02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:46.500]   you have to trust that the people who are driving it,
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:48.340]   if they have max temptation,
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:51.760]   but something could be, like the Manhattan Project,
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:54.460]   could be potentially negative for humanity,
[02:37:54.460 --> 02:37:55.720]   that they would not push the button,
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:58.860]   they would lead to the satisfaction of all their dreams,
[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:00.820]   if it would be taking an existential risk for humanity.
[02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:03.380]   And this team, I really believe in that way.
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:05.620]   And so, like, what's most exciting to me about this
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:06.660]   is the material science side.
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:08.260]   I mean, the life sciences, we could, you know,
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:09.460]   the eradication of disease,
[02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:11.220]   it's unbelievable what could happen.
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:12.260]   I think we'll be blown away
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:14.000]   by what happens in the coming years.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.820]   But the material science part of it,
[02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:17.500]   for me personally, is what matters most,
[02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:19.980]   because I really don't think it matters
[02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:21.820]   if humans are all living for 150, 200 years,
[02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.740]   if we have no climate to live on.
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:25.540]   - Right.
[02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:27.800]   - I mean, the material innovations
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:29.740]   that could be emerging in the coming years
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:32.220]   to take on the climate crisis are breathtaking.
[02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:34.500]   So it's a project I'm deeply involved in,
[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:36.260]   and it has nothing to do with competition.
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:37.660]   I mean, I guess everything is competitive
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:38.500]   from one perspective,
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:42.780]   but this is about driving discovery, driving innovation.
[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:43.860]   - I love it.
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:47.260]   It also reflects your clearly repeating pattern
[02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:49.680]   of being willing to segment your life
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:53.380]   into different goals and different pursuits,
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:55.780]   applying what you've learned previously,
[02:38:55.780 --> 02:38:57.540]   learning new things and incorporating those.
[02:38:57.540 --> 02:39:00.900]   It brings me back to two things that we touched on earlier.
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:02.840]   One, that if we don't close the hatch on,
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:04.980]   we're gonna get it from the listeners,
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:06.820]   which is this paper that we both read.
[02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:09.220]   I just want to, or took a look at.
[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:10.060]   - Before the paper,
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:11.660]   let me just say one important thing.
[02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:13.820]   To me, what you just said really hits home.
[02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:16.800]   But I think while one is taking on
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:17.640]   all these different things,
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:20.360]   for me personally, it's important to always be in the fire.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:22.100]   Like I need to be training myself,
[02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:24.020]   like what I'm doing on the ocean every day,
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:25.260]   in my own training.
[02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:28.540]   The thing that drives me crazy are armchair quarterbacks,
[02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:31.140]   or what Robert Persik used to call philosophologists.
[02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:34.500]   Which are like the literary critics versus the writer,
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:36.260]   or the philosophologist versus the philosopher,
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:38.420]   or the armchair quarterback versus the quarterback.
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:42.380]   So for me, my way of life, I just don't know.
[02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:44.940]   It's hard for me to believe in anybody in these things
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:47.620]   who isn't putting themselves on the line as a way of life.
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:51.940]   So my own ocean training, and my own competitive training,
[02:39:51.940 --> 02:39:54.580]   and like being immersed in the truth-telling nature
[02:39:54.580 --> 02:39:56.420]   of the competitive world,
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:59.260]   is something that I feel is really like,
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:01.900]   we never have the truth nailed.
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:04.220]   We're never liberated from our egoic dynamics.
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:07.420]   We're always susceptible to becoming static.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:10.020]   That's, I've really come to feel that.
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:12.340]   And I don't believe, so like,
[02:40:12.340 --> 02:40:14.020]   it's a big value system for me.
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:17.580]   - And the daily physical interactions with the ocean,
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:20.620]   with fear, with uncertainty,
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:23.900]   with just variables that you can't control,
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:25.540]   and trying to identify what are the variables
[02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:27.380]   I can control in this context,
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:30.980]   and work with those to try and tease out new learning.
[02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:36.660]   That running those algorithms every day
[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:37.980]   seems absolutely essential.
[02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:39.180]   - There's nothing like the ocean
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:42.940]   to expose any little micro inkling
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:45.220]   of like the illusion of control.
[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:46.660]   'Cause you cannot control the ocean.
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:48.180]   You can't overcome the ocean.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:49.780]   The ocean's gonna kick your ass.
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:52.220]   So you need to blend with her, and receive her,
[02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:53.060]   and honor her.
[02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:58.900]   Yeah, like that's where I do my inner work out there.
[02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:00.260]   Okay, your study, go ahead, do it.
[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:01.820]   - Well, so it's not my study,
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:03.100]   but this paper that I sent you,
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:04.900]   I think is really interesting.
[02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:06.460]   It's a paper published in the journal "Neuron,"
[02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.340]   very fine journal, excellent paper.
[02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:09.340]   We'll post a link to it,
[02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:12.260]   but has many interesting features about,
[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:13.820]   it's really about the study of surprise
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:14.860]   and the dopamine system.
[02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:18.420]   But they use as the experimental context,
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:22.780]   people watching a game of basketball,
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:24.980]   and they observe that the reset
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:28.780]   on sort of the interval timer
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:31.220]   is essentially said anytime there's been a reversal
[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:32.260]   of which team has the ball.
[02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:34.020]   So a drive down court, you know,
[02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:37.380]   by one team, then the other team.
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:39.000]   And, you know, if there's a rebound
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.300]   and then it switches direction, whatever,
[02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:41.580]   might not switch direction.
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:44.600]   I mean, basketball provides the perfect dynamic
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:46.440]   to study this while people are being,
[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:50.400]   while there's some detection of brain activity going on.
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:54.100]   And one of, I think, the most interesting questions
[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.340]   about this paper and implications are that
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:00.660]   just as we can set the aperture of our vision
[02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:03.380]   or the frame rate of how well we're clocking time,
[02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:04.740]   how finely we're clocking time
[02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:06.700]   or how coarsely we're clocking time,
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:07.660]   there's this big question,
[02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:09.660]   which is kind of a philosophical question really,
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:12.380]   which is how do we segment time in our life?
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:15.080]   Earlier, you mentioned that one of the major
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.020]   kind of timestamps, if you will,
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:23.020]   is a bad event, like a, oh shit,
[02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:25.400]   like the things went completely differently
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:26.760]   than I would have preferred them to.
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:27.680]   It could be the death of another,
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:28.800]   it could be the death of a dream,
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:32.640]   it could be a, you know, a setback or whatever,
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:34.280]   that it marks time.
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:35.380]   And we just had these fires.
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.280]   I mean, LA will be before and after the fires of 2025.
[02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:45.540]   You know, I remember early in 2020, Kobe Bryant dying, right?
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:47.580]   So these things, I remember the Challenger explosion,
[02:42:47.580 --> 02:42:49.980]   like negative events, you know,
[02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.140]   occupy a certain place in our memory
[02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:54.540]   more easily than positive events,
[02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:57.860]   but no one will forget the birth of their first child
[02:42:57.860 --> 02:42:59.820]   or hopefully their second child too
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:02.420]   if they had a second child or their wedding day, right?
[02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:04.220]   These things segment time.
[02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:09.100]   You seem to be able to segment your life
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:12.960]   into a series of pursuits where you cut ties
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:16.640]   with the practice of something like chess
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:19.040]   and you take what you learn and move it forward
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:22.160]   into what seems to be a very different lifestyle
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:23.560]   and way of being.
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:25.840]   I think one of the major challenges
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:27.740]   for a lot of people, it seems,
[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:30.320]   is how to thread the different elements of their life forward
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:33.440]   in a way that feels contiguous.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:38.480]   And I think it's probably true
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:40.260]   that most people would prefer
[02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:44.580]   to not have major losses be necessary
[02:43:44.580 --> 02:43:49.280]   in order to segment their life in the most fulfilling way.
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:53.540]   So how do you think about the segmentation of time?
[02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:54.940]   And maybe we'll run this backward
[02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:57.340]   from the scale of your lifetime.
[02:43:57.340 --> 02:43:58.620]   We don't know how long you'll live,
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:00.100]   but hopefully a long time.
[02:44:00.100 --> 02:44:02.340]   Let's assume by way of standard genetics
[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:04.820]   somewhere in the neighborhood of between 90 and 110,
[02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:06.660]   if you take good care of yourself, which you seem to.
[02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:07.500]   - Sounds good.
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:08.340]   - Okay?
[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:15.020]   And then let's compare that to how one structures a day
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:17.100]   and that will allow us to bring us back
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:18.280]   to what you talked about before
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:19.700]   with this most important question,
[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:22.120]   dynamic and focus and replenishing
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:24.980]   and dynamic between conscious and unconscious mind.
[02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:28.260]   So when you think about your life, you're 48 years old.
[02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:29.140]   - Yeah. - Okay, I'm 49.
[02:44:29.140 --> 02:44:32.020]   So we're more or less the same point
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:33.940]   looking backward anyway.
[02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:37.400]   Our lives are very different, but same age, roughly.
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:41.020]   If you think you're going to live to be about 100,
[02:44:41.020 --> 02:44:43.860]   how are you thinking about your timeframe?
[02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:44.700]   Are you thinking, okay,
[02:44:44.700 --> 02:44:47.220]   here's what I'm going to do for the next five years.
[02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:50.540]   10, I'll allow that whatever's happening in my life
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:52.340]   to dictate what I do next.
[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:55.120]   I mean, how are you running this analysis?
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:57.260]   - That's an awesome question.
[02:44:57.260 --> 02:44:58.300]   I mean, so we have to,
[02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:00.660]   we're basically taking all the macro and all the micro
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:02.460]   and we're going to boil it down right here.
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:03.300]   That's beautiful.
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:04.960]   Um.
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:13.080]   That was a very expansive, elegant question.
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:17.680]   I think the true answer, it's interesting.
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.680]   There's, I find this distinction between how,
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:25.100]   like when I think about a question like that,
[02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:28.440]   between how I actually relate to the question
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:31.080]   and how I might deconstruct how I actually relate
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:33.680]   to the question to make it relatable.
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:36.840]   But is the deconstructed version actually true
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:40.360]   to how I really relate to the question, right?
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:47.240]   'Cause accurate deconstruction is so nuanced
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:49.320]   and difficult, right?
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:53.360]   So if I, how I experientially relate to that question
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:57.540]   is that I'm living, I want to live my life
[02:45:57.540 --> 02:46:00.860]   with just relentless truth to myself,
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:05.620]   with authenticity, with love, with receptivity.
[02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:09.800]   I want to deepen my connection to what I'm doing,
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:13.580]   the arts I'm practicing in specifically,
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:16.980]   and in utilizing and tapping into my relationship
[02:46:16.980 --> 02:46:20.000]   to the universe through the artistic exploration.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.740]   I have not planned out the next 10, 20, 40, 50, 60 years.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:30.040]   I do have a long time horizon on how I think about plans
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:32.340]   and developments and projects I'm working on.
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:39.380]   But it's like this fusion of the cultivation
[02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:44.380]   of full presence right now, and playing the long game.
[02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:47.620]   But I don't, I'm not clear on where the long game is going.
[02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:50.740]   One of my dear friends, Boyd Vardy, you know Boyd?
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:53.380]   - I know of him and I'm a huge admirer of his work.
[02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:54.980]   - Oh, you should have him on, he's awesome.
[02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:56.980]   He's a beautiful, or you should go to South Africa
[02:46:56.980 --> 02:46:58.660]   and go on a lion track with him.
[02:46:58.660 --> 02:46:59.780]   - Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to.
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:01.620]   - Yeah, so he's an awesome--
[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:02.700]   - I've been connected to him through Martha
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:04.340]   back, a previous guest on this podcast,
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:05.860]   and she spent, they're good friends.
[02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:09.340]   They've spent a lot of time in Londolozzi together,
[02:47:09.340 --> 02:47:11.580]   and I'd love to get Boyd Vardy on here.
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:12.980]   - He's a beautiful soul.
[02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:15.380]   He's a real brother, he's a kindred spirit.
[02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:16.780]   Like every once in a while, you run into someone,
[02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:18.940]   you're like, [laughs]
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:24.940]   In his book, "Lion Tracker's Guide to Life,"
[02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:27.060]   he has this gorgeous quote,
[02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:32.200]   which is the words of a master tracker, Reneas.
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:35.120]   "I have no idea where I'm going,
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:37.020]   "but I know exactly how to get there."
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:41.440]   When I read those words, I was just like,
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:43.900]   they resonated very deeply in my soul.
[02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:46.060]   I think those words are a really good,
[02:47:46.060 --> 02:47:47.140]   I would take out the exactly,
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:49.220]   I don't know anything exactly,
[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:50.500]   so I don't know where I'm going,
[02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:53.620]   but I have a really beautiful sense
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:55.820]   that I'm tracking my way there.
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:48:00.340]   - You've got a process that seems to work very well.
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:01.460]   At least up until this point,
[02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:03.780]   there's no reason to think it wouldn't work well,
[02:48:03.780 --> 02:48:05.940]   especially given that you said not exactly,
[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:09.740]   leaving that openness to changes in our biology,
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:14.300]   life events in and for people around us.
[02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:16.140]   - I have a big part of me,
[02:48:16.140 --> 02:48:17.180]   and it's a strength and a weakness.
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:18.700]   And I think a lot, when I meet people,
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:19.940]   I think a lot about the entanglement
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:21.700]   of their brilliance and their eccentricity,
[02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:23.460]   or their genius and their dysfunction.
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.300]   And when you're working with peak performers,
[02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:26.380]   you need to understand it,
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:28.540]   and its entanglement is often very, very complex,
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.360]   and people can think,
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:30.300]   "Oh, I can make this person more efficient
[02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:31.500]   "by just removing this,"
[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:33.120]   but that will be connected to their genius,
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:35.660]   and you'll be cutting some of it away, right?
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:38.500]   And so when you're working with crazy, brilliant,
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.340]   and anyone who's really a virtuoso
[02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:43.160]   has some craziness built into what they're doing.
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:47.400]   And the entanglement of their brilliance
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:51.620]   and their dysfunction is so complex and nuanced,
[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:54.240]   and one should be very careful to not do anything
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:56.900]   until one understands that entanglement with huge nuance.
[02:48:56.900 --> 02:48:59.680]   And so the art of coaching people of that nature
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.340]   is like 99.9% listening, observing, not doing.
[02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:04.860]   And one of the biggest mistakes that coaches make
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:07.020]   is doing, doing too much,
[02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:09.180]   'cause they need to show that they're valuable, right?
[02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:11.300]   And so I think a lot about,
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:13.200]   like, we need to really understand
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:14.800]   the nature of that entanglement.
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:19.660]   And in me, that entanglement's complex.
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:24.260]   And I have a profound allergy
[02:49:24.260 --> 02:49:25.860]   to being untrue to myself.
[02:49:25.860 --> 02:49:27.820]   Why?
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:29.440]   Well, I think a big part of the reason
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:32.740]   is that period when I was 15, 16, 17, 18 years old,
[02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:34.620]   and I described where I got pulled
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:36.620]   into this externalized thing from the film
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:38.760]   and the public scrutiny when I wasn't ready for it,
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:43.760]   and being urged and not having the maturity to resist it,
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:45.540]   'cause that's ultimately on me,
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:48.140]   to take on chess outside of my self-expression.
[02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:51.340]   Like, what would Karpov do here, not what would Josh do here?
[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:52.620]   And I didn't have the understanding
[02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:56.180]   of learning Karpov through Kasparov, right?
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:49:57.860]   And so I moved into,
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:49:59.660]   like, my first love was taken away from me,
[02:49:59.660 --> 02:50:02.700]   or I allowed myself to have it taken away from me,
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:05.500]   which is how I would actually frame it.
[02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:08.260]   And it was made static and stale
[02:50:08.260 --> 02:50:10.020]   and corrupted and externalized.
[02:50:10.020 --> 02:50:13.580]   And there's so much existential heartbreak in me
[02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:15.300]   about the loss of that first love
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:22.440]   that I have the gift of being just fucking allergic
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:25.560]   to being untrue to myself.
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:28.540]   And so that's part of how I track through life,
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:32.480]   is if I don't love someone, I don't work with them,
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:34.620]   no matter what the temptation is.
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:37.720]   If something feels untrue to me, I don't do it.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:40.320]   Now, sometimes we have to sit in the unknowing for a while,
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:43.680]   and something can be off for a while, right?
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:46.280]   It's like there's peaks and valleys of everything, right?
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:48.200]   And we're still in the learning process, right?
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:50.280]   We can have long plateaus.
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:52.960]   Like, when I stopped playing chess,
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:54.160]   I felt like I'd lost the love,
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:57.560]   but I sat for two years with the question
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:50:59.640]   to be clear on whether I was in a plateau of the love
[02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:00.960]   or if I'd lost the love.
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:01.800]   And then I gained clarity.
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:03.040]   No, no, you've lost the love.
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:03.880]   And then I was done.
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:05.120]   Never played again.
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:06.680]   Never played a chess game again.
[02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:10.560]   So that factored in.
[02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:11.880]   Like, I have this...
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:17.200]   - It's so interesting how our, like, some of the,
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:19.760]   like, our most powerful
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:27.480]   guiding principles or voices in us
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:29.480]   can come from our deepest wounds, right?
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:32.320]   - They absolutely do.
[02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:35.560]   I mean, I think it's a, because I think, you know,
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:38.240]   this concept of energy is a complicated one,
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:40.080]   and there's no clear definition anyway.
[02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:41.080]   But when I think about energy,
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:42.360]   I don't think about caloric energy.
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:44.160]   I think of neural energy.
[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:47.160]   And I think about certain neural circuits like that.
[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:52.160]   Like, if you, like, I love the feeling of excitement
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:56.320]   and tension that then is funneled into a specific activity
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.560]   that then yields some new vista, repeat.
[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:02.680]   You know, it's just, that's science, and that's learning.
[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:05.040]   The day I realized that I'll never, you know,
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:07.560]   saturate all the knowledge that I could gather,
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:09.680]   organize, and disseminate through the podcast,
[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:12.640]   I was like, "F yes."
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:13.960]   Like, that's just great because there's,
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:16.000]   but I realize also that thing,
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.240]   we can saturate ourselves internally.
[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:21.280]   We can drive ourselves to the point of no replenishment.
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:24.240]   We can, you know, get so narrow focus.
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:26.880]   That's why I think so much about aperture in time and space.
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:29.400]   We can get so narrow focus that we end up, you know,
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:32.880]   like a gopher that, you know, dug our way into a desert.
[02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:34.360]   And then we're like,
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:36.720]   or you're just far from your family or far from home,
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:39.560]   you know, because you just dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:42.040]   So, you know, I think I, what is it?
[02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:44.040]   You know, like eagle vision, you know.
[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:49.440]   I think that the diving birds are probably the ultimate
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:51.040]   in terms of having panoramic vision.
[02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:53.960]   Do you notice they have a horizon viewing density of cells
[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:55.000]   so they can view the horizon
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.440]   and they have a pupil to view the fish
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:52:59.940]   so that they can dive and grab the fish
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:03.600]   despite the refraction of light under the water
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:05.800]   'cause the fish isn't actually where they see it.
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:08.560]   When people say eagle vision versus, you know,
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:10.580]   like, you know, what's it, you know,
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:12.880]   like predator vision up close or something.
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:16.280]   - Like cormorants, so they're like the diving birds.
[02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:17.380]   Those birds, yeah.
[02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:21.280]   - Yeah, so they're flying and they're tracking the horizon
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:24.680]   and they're also tracking things
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:26.520]   right below them simultaneously.
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:29.000]   That to me is the ultimate state to try and achieve
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.920]   in terms of space and time tracking.
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:31.760]   - That's a beautiful metaphor.
[02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:35.800]   - And they have to also adjust for, right, refractory.
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:37.760]   - If you've tried like archery from above water,
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:39.480]   underwater, which I used to paddle board
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:43.600]   while I spear fishing above water with a bow,
[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:46.200]   that refraction is hard to calculate.
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:49.640]   - Yeah, diving seabirds are the ones that really just-
[02:53:49.640 --> 02:53:50.800]   - I'm going to do it.
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:51.640]   - They're the ultimate.
[02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:52.480]   - I'm going to do a study there.
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:54.520]   I want to learn about them.
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:55.560]   - Okay, great. - That's beautiful.
[02:53:55.560 --> 02:53:57.120]   - Yeah, I can send you some literature there.
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:58.160]   - I'd love it.
[02:53:58.160 --> 02:54:00.200]   - The time unit of a day
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:03.980]   is what most people can manage in their minds.
[02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:09.040]   Maybe you could return to this cycle
[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:14.040]   of conscious focus, stimulus response,
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:15.620]   and getting out of that.
[02:54:15.620 --> 02:54:17.400]   I love the example of going to take a piss
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:18.600]   'cause everyone does it.
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:23.120]   I do think too many people do it holding a phone.
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:24.280]   - Yeah, oh my God.
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:25.920]   - Can't be good for a number of reasons.
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:28.680]   [both laughing]
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:30.560]   Maybe just walk us through that.
[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:33.400]   So do you think it's,
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:35.000]   let me ask a series of short questions.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.560]   So when I wake up in the morning, for instance,
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:39.240]   like many people, I don't feel immediately alert.
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:42.140]   I don't feel like I could just dive into writing
[02:54:42.140 --> 02:54:43.520]   if writing is the most important thing
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:44.360]   I need to do that day,
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:46.720]   or I have some transition time.
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:48.480]   Do you think that people should embrace
[02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:52.440]   natural transition times on the timescale of a day,
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:54.360]   or that they should train themselves
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:56.760]   to bounce into effort,
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:01.760]   like go with the flow or force oneself through the door?
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:04.040]   - Well, how I relate to that personally,
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:06.120]   I've spent a lot of time thinking about day architecture.
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:08.240]   Well, I call it day architecture.
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.240]   And I think there's some very systematic things we can do,
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:16.800]   but I think like anything,
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:18.480]   they should be individualized, right?
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:20.520]   I don't think that everyone should follow a certain model
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:21.720]   'cause we're all very different.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.920]   You know that old book that Tim actually produced,
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:26.240]   the audio book, "Daily Rituals"?
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:27.080]   - Oh yeah.
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:28.440]   - Like one of the best things about "Daily Rituals"
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:30.520]   is how few patterns there are through them.
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:31.680]   It's just-- - I love that book.
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:33.080]   - Hilarious and brilliant. - We'll put a link to it.
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:34.520]   - Such a good book. - So good.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:37.400]   - I'm so glad that Tim Ferris, who we're referring to,
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:39.600]   collected all these habits of different writers,
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.880]   and like some of them are so quirky and crazy,
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:43.560]   and some of them are downright dangerous.
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:45.960]   - Well, he published the audio book of it, right?
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:48.840]   And I think I told Tim, he'll remind me,
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:51.200]   I think I might've, I think I told Tim about that book
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.040]   like many, many years ago when he did the audio book,
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:55.280]   and it's so good. - It's so good.
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:57.640]   - And it just follows the daily routine.
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:59.560]   It breaks down the daily routine.
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:01.680]   It's like two to three to four page chapters
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:04.680]   on like a hundred some brilliant artists
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:06.560]   and scientists and creators,
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:08.400]   and they're just so random how they live.
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:11.880]   - Some are out partying all night, drugs, alcohol, caffeine,
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:14.200]   others are super regimented and monk-like.
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:19.040]   It's the range of daily architectures is so vast.
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:21.880]   - So I think we need to have like that awareness
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:24.160]   and that sense of humor and humility about it,
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:26.440]   and we can get systematic and structured at the same time.
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:28.760]   I think it's important to hold both of those.
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:30.400]   - I mean, what you just asked,
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:34.720]   I do believe that that beautiful period
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:38.840]   when we first wake up and that dream state is so powerful.
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:42.160]   And I think that people, almost all people
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:44.840]   immediately pick up their phone and start checking messages,
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:47.920]   which just shuts down one's awareness
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:50.720]   of what's been happening beneath the surface all night.
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:54.240]   So I think that that's a real lost opportunity.
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:56.960]   I remember when I was 11 years old, I read this.
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.360]   My dad actually gave me this Hemingway essay
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:02.280]   on his creative process.
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:04.120]   And there's one of my favorite,
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:06.240]   sometimes there's like an insanely potent book
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:07.520]   that's put together.
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:10.040]   And two that come to mind are "Lessons of History,"
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:13.920]   which is this short compilation of Will and Ariel Durant,
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:14.960]   two of the greatest historians
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:17.700]   who've published tens of thousands of pages.
[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:21.240]   This is a short compilation of a handful of thematic essays.
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:23.760]   It's only like 100 pages of all their life's work
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:24.920]   boiled down to a few themes.
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:26.160]   It's unbelievably potent.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:28.720]   And "Hemingway on Writing" is another book of that nature,
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:32.640]   which takes all of Hemingway's from his books,
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:34.480]   from his letters, private letters,
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:38.300]   from his articles and essays and notebooks,
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:40.080]   like everything he's written about the creative process
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:42.400]   and boils it into this like short book
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.920]   on his principles of creativity, just unbelievable.
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:47.900]   But before that book came out, I read this piece,
[02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:49.580]   the short thing he'd written about the creative process,
[02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:50.420]   which was essentially,
[02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:52.560]   he'd always leave a sentence unwritten.
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:56.680]   He'd end his workday with a sentence like half written.
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:57:58.680]   So leaving with a sense of direction.
[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:00.800]   And then he would let it go.
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:01.880]   You know, he would go out drinking,
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:04.720]   he would do all the things that Hemingway did.
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:06.120]   And then he returned to it first thing in the morning
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:07.640]   and that like unwritten sentence
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:09.240]   had become a paragraph and a page in his mind
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:11.520]   and it would be a way to hit the ground running.
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:13.080]   And that's what really spurred me
[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:15.960]   to start creating this process in my chess life
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:18.440]   of always ending my chess study with something left,
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:20.400]   like posing my unconscious a question,
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.480]   like studying the complexity and then releasing it
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:23.520]   which later became,
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:24.960]   and then tapping into it first thing in the morning,
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:27.640]   pre-input, which later became my MIQ process.
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:30.240]   And then I developed team-wide MIQ processes.
[02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:34.280]   The teams that I work with all have versions of the MIQ
[02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:36.520]   that they utilize as individuals, but then as teams.
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:37.760]   And it's an amazing way to develop
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:39.320]   a shared consciousness in a team,
[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:42.640]   to have everybody be able to tap into the question
[02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:44.720]   that's top of mind for every member of their team
[02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:46.560]   or for a leader to be able to be aware
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:48.580]   of what is the most important question
[02:58:48.580 --> 02:58:50.800]   for every one of my scientists or my analysts or anything.
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:52.760]   It's a really powerful way
[02:58:52.760 --> 02:58:54.120]   to cultivate shared consciousness
[02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:56.320]   and it becomes our game tape.
[02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:59.960]   Because if we have an, if we're tracking our MIQs,
[02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:02.280]   let's say I'm studying something for three weeks
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:03.320]   or for four weeks.
[02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:06.520]   And what do I think is most,
[02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:07.880]   if I'm tracking the questions
[02:59:07.880 --> 02:59:09.720]   that I think are most critical for that thing
[02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:11.920]   and I'm deepening my analysis of it,
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:14.680]   what I arrive at, what I think in day one
[02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:16.880]   will be very different from the MIQ in day 14.
[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:18.300]   And then we can study the gap
[02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:20.900]   and then we can study the patterns of the gap, the gaps.
[02:59:20.900 --> 02:59:23.060]   And this is what I call MIQ gap analysis.
[02:59:23.060 --> 02:59:24.860]   So if I'm setting a chess position,
[02:59:24.860 --> 02:59:26.700]   like if I play a chess game against you
[02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:28.180]   and it's incredibly complex
[02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:31.140]   and I don't quite understand this position
[02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:33.600]   and then I do a deep, deep analysis of it,
[02:59:33.600 --> 02:59:38.020]   what I'll arrive at after 14 or 16 or 18 hours of study
[02:59:38.020 --> 02:59:41.140]   will be different from what I felt during the game.
[02:59:41.140 --> 02:59:42.840]   Now, what's interesting is,
[02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:44.500]   this is a cool thing about chess study.
[02:59:44.500 --> 02:59:47.260]   If my understanding was here during the chess game,
[02:59:47.260 --> 02:59:48.580]   after like a few hours,
[02:59:48.580 --> 02:59:50.780]   I might be like really far away from that.
[02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:52.300]   But after I've completed the study,
[02:59:52.300 --> 02:59:55.860]   I'll usually be like very similar, but deeper.
[02:59:55.860 --> 02:59:57.940]   So it's often like deeper,
[02:59:57.940 --> 03:00:00.700]   like closer than where you were after a few hours of study,
[03:00:00.700 --> 03:00:02.700]   but it's like a deeper level in.
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:05.620]   But what's the gap between that and that,
[03:00:05.620 --> 03:00:07.820]   between where I was in the game
[03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:09.440]   and what are the patterns in the gaps?
[03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:11.660]   And then if you think about those patterns in the gaps
[03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:13.500]   through those lenses of the technical,
[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:16.420]   the thematic and the psychological, right?
[03:00:16.420 --> 03:00:18.960]   We deconstruct it in that way.
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:21.000]   Then that becomes our game tape, right?
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:22.700]   One of the hardest things for mental athletes
[03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:23.920]   is to actually have game tape
[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:27.180]   the way basketball players do or foilers do or fighters do.
[03:00:27.180 --> 03:00:28.660]   We can see the actual game tape.
[03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:30.660]   We need to create our mental game tape.
[03:00:30.660 --> 03:00:32.220]   So this is a way that I,
[03:00:32.220 --> 03:00:34.220]   it both enhances the creative process
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:36.480]   and creates the game tape for the training process.
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:40.420]   And then studying the gap analysis we do
[03:00:40.420 --> 03:00:43.500]   reveals what we need to focus our deliberate practice on.
[03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:46.000]   - This difference between physical endeavors
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.460]   and cognitive endeavors, I think is so key.
[03:00:48.460 --> 03:00:51.560]   Nowadays, most people are involved in cognitive endeavors
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:53.020]   and there's so much,
[03:00:53.020 --> 03:00:55.060]   it's basically like being in a glass house
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:56.720]   with windows everywhere.
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:00.620]   I mean, social media, texting, windows,
[03:01:00.620 --> 03:01:01.980]   internet connection on the computer.
[03:01:01.980 --> 03:01:03.420]   There's just so many points of entry
[03:01:03.420 --> 03:01:05.900]   and where one can become distracted.
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:07.940]   Whereas if you paddle out to ocean,
[03:01:07.940 --> 03:01:10.580]   sure, you could bring your phone perhaps,
[03:01:10.580 --> 03:01:15.380]   but you're limited by the environment
[03:01:15.380 --> 03:01:16.900]   and the need for safety
[03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:18.700]   of the number of things that you can think about.
[03:01:18.700 --> 03:01:21.300]   - Funny, I wore an Apple watch training a little bit
[03:01:21.300 --> 03:01:23.740]   on the ocean and it was good for me
[03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:26.460]   'cause I wanted to like align my intuition on speed
[03:01:26.460 --> 03:01:28.100]   with what actually it was showing
[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:29.380]   and it was good to calibrate myself.
[03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:32.160]   But man, I took it off.
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:34.820]   It's so much better being on the ocean without technology.
[03:01:34.820 --> 03:01:36.220]   - Yeah. - Like being liberated from it.
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:37.980]   Tracking, yeah.
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:40.980]   - I'm learning to turn stuff off while I work.
[03:01:40.980 --> 03:01:44.220]   I mean, I have had to learn to just fight things back
[03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:45.620]   because when I started in science,
[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:48.180]   I mean, I didn't have a smartphone, I didn't any of that.
[03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:50.880]   And yet one really has to fight nowadays
[03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:54.500]   for their freedom from these interruptions.
[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:57.940]   So it's something that people really have to cultivate.
[03:01:57.940 --> 03:01:59.820]   So in terms of the structure of that day,
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:01.260]   do you pose a question for the day?
[03:02:01.260 --> 03:02:02.940]   Like the most important question, would it be like,
[03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:05.900]   let's say, like I'm working on a revision of this book
[03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:07.260]   that I delayed release on
[03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:09.240]   'cause I wanted to add a bunch of things to it.
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:11.660]   So would one say, you know, the most important question is,
[03:02:11.660 --> 03:02:13.140]   you know, how do I finish this book today?
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.420]   Or is there, I'm guessing it's more conceptual than that.
[03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:18.740]   - I think that you can, I mean, it's a tool
[03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:22.080]   that one can utilize tactically or strategically, right?
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:24.500]   So it can be like, if you're in creative flow,
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.340]   just leaving yourself with a sense of direction
[03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:28.260]   or it can actually be zooming out
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:31.260]   and thinking about like, what is the highest order question
[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:34.860]   that I'm grappling with, right?
[03:02:34.860 --> 03:02:37.100]   But I think it's like, one wants to stretch for the,
[03:02:37.100 --> 03:02:38.580]   if one is doing the latter,
[03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:41.420]   the higher order of strategic thinking,
[03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:43.500]   it's like, you can think of like,
[03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:46.340]   one is stretching for the question that matters most
[03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:50.420]   with the same kind of intellectual or cognitive intensity
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:52.420]   that one is experiencing, for example,
[03:02:52.420 --> 03:02:55.380]   pushing yourself from like 168 to 176
[03:02:55.380 --> 03:02:57.860]   in cardiovascular interval training, right?
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:59.380]   Like you're really stretching mentally.
[03:02:59.380 --> 03:03:00.400]   So you need to be at your stretch point.
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:02.580]   Growth comes at the point of resistance, right?
[03:03:02.580 --> 03:03:05.140]   So we, but intellectually,
[03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:06.660]   we're not used to really feeling
[03:03:06.660 --> 03:03:07.660]   when we're at our stretch point.
[03:03:07.660 --> 03:03:09.540]   So we're thinking about a question, but that's a question.
[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:10.580]   What's the higher order question?
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:12.140]   What's the higher order question?
[03:03:12.140 --> 03:03:13.420]   What's the question that really matters?
[03:03:13.420 --> 03:03:14.940]   And one way to frame it is like,
[03:03:14.940 --> 03:03:16.100]   our mind, if we're good at something,
[03:03:16.100 --> 03:03:19.820]   slices like a knife through butter through most things,
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:21.760]   but then there's a place we're stuck.
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:24.260]   Like those stuck points are the MIQs.
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:26.060]   Those stuck points are like, right?
[03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:26.900]   Like we don't need to wait.
[03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:28.660]   We don't need, like the mind will just get there like,
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:30.420]   oh, but that's the thing.
[03:03:30.420 --> 03:03:31.820]   And then we explore there, like what,
[03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:33.820]   how does that stretch within that stuck point?
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:35.960]   - And that's usually where people,
[03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:37.740]   including myself, pivot away.
[03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:39.520]   I'm thinking outside of the work domain now.
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:41.500]   Like, I don't want to think about it.
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:42.940]   Like it's when we tend to,
[03:03:42.940 --> 03:03:46.620]   I noticed that there's an infinite amount
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:50.140]   of distraction available nowadays, if we want it.
[03:03:50.140 --> 03:03:52.640]   And, you know, audio books and podcasts.
[03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:54.780]   And I think podcasts are wonderful, but you know,
[03:03:54.780 --> 03:03:56.080]   they can be a source of distraction
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:57.800]   from the critical question we need to be asking,
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:03:58.940]   or they can be a source of answers
[03:03:58.940 --> 03:04:01.380]   for perhaps the critical questions we're asking.
[03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:05.200]   But there's just so,
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.180]   there's so many of these opportunities
[03:04:07.180 --> 03:04:10.580]   to just look away from something that is like a,
[03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:12.900]   it's like a emotional infection.
[03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:14.900]   It's different than an infection in your skin
[03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:17.020]   that's nagging 'cause you can feel it there,
[03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:18.820]   and you want to get that thing out, right?
[03:04:18.820 --> 03:04:21.180]   Very primal instinct, like get that thing out,
[03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:22.460]   get the infection out.
[03:04:22.460 --> 03:04:23.540]   This is like an emotional infection
[03:04:23.540 --> 03:04:25.780]   that you can just kind of not see
[03:04:25.780 --> 03:04:27.220]   if you choose to turn away.
[03:04:27.220 --> 03:04:30.540]   But those are the things that really get you over time.
[03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:32.180]   - That's why we do our cold water training.
[03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:34.660]   Like that's where we like, we train at living
[03:04:34.660 --> 03:04:36.660]   on the other side of pain, of enjoying it.
[03:04:36.660 --> 03:04:38.820]   Like that place, that place that like itches,
[03:04:38.820 --> 03:04:40.220]   like ah, so you bounce away from that,
[03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:43.580]   but that's where you need to sit, right?
[03:04:43.580 --> 03:04:44.980]   But we can practice that thematically,
[03:04:44.980 --> 03:04:47.660]   like loving that discomfort, wanting it, hunting for it,
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:49.220]   like finding the place where we're stuck,
[03:04:49.220 --> 03:04:51.260]   and then letting it sit,
[03:04:51.260 --> 03:04:52.540]   and then not bouncing away from it,
[03:04:52.540 --> 03:04:56.180]   but just releasing it and returning to it.
[03:04:56.180 --> 03:04:57.140]   And we have insights, right?
[03:04:57.140 --> 03:04:58.180]   'Cause often in those moments,
[03:04:58.300 --> 03:05:01.220]   where we have our insights are,
[03:05:01.220 --> 03:05:02.260]   like when we wake up in the morning,
[03:05:02.260 --> 03:05:03.500]   are in those stuck points.
[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:05.140]   And I find it's very interesting.
[03:05:05.140 --> 03:05:06.260]   I'm sure you've done this,
[03:05:06.260 --> 03:05:09.540]   I've done like hundreds of diagnostics
[03:05:09.540 --> 03:05:10.980]   with people on my teams,
[03:05:10.980 --> 03:05:13.780]   like where do they have most of their creative breakthroughs?
[03:05:13.780 --> 03:05:16.280]   And so many of them are in the shower.
[03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:17.120]   It's really interesting.
[03:05:17.120 --> 03:05:18.700]   I think a big part of that is like the full body,
[03:05:18.700 --> 03:05:23.100]   somatic immersion moves them out of conscious thinking
[03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:26.580]   into like, 'cause their mind is experiencing,
[03:05:26.580 --> 03:05:28.180]   and then the release of the conscious mind
[03:05:28.180 --> 03:05:30.240]   allows the unconscious to run,
[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:31.500]   and then they tap into it.
[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:32.340]   - First thing in the morning
[03:05:32.340 --> 03:05:34.380]   is when I get my insights or understanding,
[03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:37.460]   or when the truth hits me square in the face.
[03:05:37.460 --> 03:05:38.580]   Well, like there's no avoiding,
[03:05:38.580 --> 03:05:39.620]   I wake up, I think about like,
[03:05:39.620 --> 03:05:41.260]   "Okay, that's the thing I got to deal with."
[03:05:41.260 --> 03:05:42.980]   And I tend to write it down right away,
[03:05:42.980 --> 03:05:44.700]   try not to write it down on my phone.
[03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:46.060]   I think having a point of capture
[03:05:46.060 --> 03:05:48.700]   that doesn't offer any other distractions,
[03:05:48.700 --> 03:05:50.540]   that's why I'm a big believer in pen and paper.
[03:05:50.540 --> 03:05:51.380]   - I 100% agree with you.
[03:05:51.380 --> 03:05:53.140]   And like, so first of all, I agree,
[03:05:53.140 --> 03:05:54.380]   first thing in the morning, that's the juice,
[03:05:54.380 --> 03:05:57.540]   and the whole MIQ process is geared toward harnessing that,
[03:05:57.540 --> 03:05:59.660]   like tapping into that, right?
[03:05:59.660 --> 03:06:01.760]   Like feeding the mind, 'cause that just happened to me
[03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:02.900]   so many dozens of times,
[03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:04.740]   where I would just have the insight in the morning,
[03:06:04.740 --> 03:06:06.700]   but then I realized I should be finding
[03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:08.380]   the areas of stuckness and feeding it to myself
[03:06:08.380 --> 03:06:10.020]   to have the insight about.
[03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:13.420]   So it's like directing that creative process.
[03:06:13.420 --> 03:06:15.080]   But then if we open up our phones,
[03:06:15.080 --> 03:06:17.140]   like the moment we start to see emails
[03:06:17.140 --> 03:06:19.020]   without reading them or see anything,
[03:06:19.020 --> 03:06:21.060]   we're unconsciously solving for what's in the emails.
[03:06:21.060 --> 03:06:22.800]   - Yeah, it's all stimulus response.
[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:23.640]   You're going into stimulus.
[03:06:23.640 --> 03:06:26.600]   If people can start to think about being reflective
[03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:28.040]   versus in stimulus response,
[03:06:28.040 --> 03:06:31.140]   I think that's sort of like the widest binning of all this.
[03:06:31.140 --> 03:06:33.000]   I have to say the shower.
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:34.100]   I've talked about this thing
[03:06:34.100 --> 03:06:36.660]   about why people have insights in the shower with my friend.
[03:06:36.660 --> 03:06:38.100]   I'd love to introduce you to him at some point.
[03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:40.580]   We've been friends since we were seven years old.
[03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:42.580]   My friend, Dr. Eddie Chang, he's a neurosurgeon
[03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:44.140]   and the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[03:06:44.140 --> 03:06:46.100]   and he studies speech and language.
[03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:47.980]   And he's taken people with locked-in syndrome
[03:06:47.980 --> 03:06:49.220]   and developed AI algorithms
[03:06:49.220 --> 03:06:51.740]   so that they can speak through a screen
[03:06:51.740 --> 03:06:53.780]   with their face moving in real time
[03:06:53.780 --> 03:06:56.380]   by decoding human speech or human speech cortex.
[03:06:56.380 --> 03:06:58.240]   And a truly brilliant individual.
[03:06:58.240 --> 03:06:59.200]   He's been on this podcast.
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:00.860]   He'll come back again.
[03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:02.060]   Ask him about the shower thing,
[03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:03.660]   'cause he used to work on neuroplasticity
[03:07:03.660 --> 03:07:04.860]   of the auditory system.
[03:07:04.860 --> 03:07:10.540]   We think, we wonder if it's the kind of white noise
[03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:11.860]   of the shower as well.
[03:07:11.860 --> 03:07:12.760]   - Yeah.
[03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:14.880]   - Because Eddie's done beautiful work
[03:07:14.880 --> 03:07:17.720]   showing that it's the signal to noise in the auditory system
[03:07:17.720 --> 03:07:20.540]   that defines whether or not a certain pattern of speech
[03:07:20.540 --> 03:07:23.340]   or auditory cue gets remembered.
[03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:26.540]   So when you have this in the background,
[03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:27.820]   let's just put this in the terms
[03:07:27.820 --> 03:07:30.260]   that we've been referring to this up until now.
[03:07:30.260 --> 03:07:32.740]   The thoughts that surface above that noise
[03:07:32.740 --> 03:07:35.180]   have a big, sharp peak relative to the background.
[03:07:35.180 --> 03:07:36.560]   So it's the signal to noise.
[03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:38.300]   Whereas certainly the opposite would be
[03:07:38.300 --> 03:07:39.920]   when you're on your phone and you're scrolling through
[03:07:39.920 --> 03:07:41.700]   and you're looking at all the thoughts and feelings
[03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:43.600]   and stuff of other people.
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:46.460]   So how do you capture your own thoughts
[03:07:46.460 --> 03:07:47.300]   in terms of which are,
[03:07:47.300 --> 03:07:48.940]   and filter them through what's meaningful
[03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:50.900]   and what's not meaningful?
[03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:53.440]   Is I think actually a really important question
[03:07:53.440 --> 03:07:54.660]   to begin with.
[03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:59.660]   And white noise background with very deprived,
[03:07:59.660 --> 03:08:01.100]   you know, visual stimulation,
[03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:02.820]   most showers aren't that interesting.
[03:08:02.820 --> 03:08:05.300]   It's white noise, blank walls,
[03:08:05.300 --> 03:08:07.080]   a few things that are familiar to you.
[03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:10.460]   So they basically disappear from your visual field.
[03:08:10.460 --> 03:08:12.580]   And the idea is that thoughts then can,
[03:08:12.580 --> 03:08:14.620]   that are constantly geysering up through
[03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:17.060]   your unconscious mind can be captured
[03:08:17.060 --> 03:08:19.260]   because everything else is noise.
[03:08:19.260 --> 03:08:21.060]   Perhaps this is a hypothesis.
[03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:23.180]   And maybe I'll put you and Eddie together sometime
[03:08:23.180 --> 03:08:25.020]   and just be an observer.
[03:08:25.020 --> 03:08:26.600]   - Yeah, that's powerful.
[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:28.740]   - So, I mean, that's how we learn language.
[03:08:28.740 --> 03:08:31.980]   It's the error signals against the background noise.
[03:08:31.980 --> 03:08:34.540]   It's all, that's just how you fix stutter.
[03:08:34.540 --> 03:08:37.700]   It's a, you create background noise.
[03:08:37.700 --> 03:08:39.360]   You increase noise to,
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:41.860]   which actually elevates signal in the auditory system.
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:44.940]   Oddly, in any case.
[03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:48.980]   - So you found that four and a half hours
[03:08:48.980 --> 03:08:50.940]   was the sweet spot of a focused work.
[03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:52.620]   But for some people, it might be an hour.
[03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:54.780]   They might need to train up that level of focus.
[03:08:54.780 --> 03:08:56.060]   - Well, and if it's four and a half hours,
[03:08:56.060 --> 03:08:57.820]   it's not like that's like a lot,
[03:08:57.820 --> 03:09:00.300]   the rest of the day is feeding into
[03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:01.940]   like those being brilliant, right?
[03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:04.300]   So if it's four and a half hours of creative output time,
[03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:06.220]   then there are other periods where one can do,
[03:09:06.220 --> 03:09:08.080]   have inputs that feed it, right?
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:08.920]   I think that's very good for people
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:10.780]   to have an awareness of what their energy,
[03:09:10.780 --> 03:09:12.260]   like what their peaks and valleys are
[03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:13.860]   of their energy throughout the day.
[03:09:13.860 --> 03:09:15.600]   And then align their peak creativity work
[03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:17.220]   with their peak energy periods.
[03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:18.140]   I think it's really important
[03:09:18.140 --> 03:09:20.840]   to not be in a constantly reactive state.
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:21.860]   One of the things I find fascinating
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:23.620]   is how people will have meetings scheduled everywhere,
[03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:25.940]   and then fit their thinking between meetings,
[03:09:25.940 --> 03:09:27.300]   and how liberating it is for them
[03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:29.100]   when they actually now block out their time
[03:09:29.100 --> 03:09:31.260]   for creative output time, right?
[03:09:31.260 --> 03:09:32.740]   Like it might be color-coded in their calendar,
[03:09:32.740 --> 03:09:34.800]   and then have meetings fit around there.
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:38.900]   So their day is driven by their self-expression,
[03:09:38.900 --> 03:09:41.580]   as opposed to by a constant set of reactivity,
[03:09:41.580 --> 03:09:44.060]   and just more, and more, and more, and more, right?
[03:09:44.060 --> 03:09:46.420]   I think harnessing the undulation of stress and recovery
[03:09:46.420 --> 03:09:48.260]   throughout the day is hugely important.
[03:09:48.260 --> 03:09:49.580]   I think having workouts throughout the day,
[03:09:49.580 --> 03:09:51.580]   even micro-workouts during the day,
[03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:53.140]   meditation periods during the workday,
[03:09:53.140 --> 03:09:55.740]   everything being quality over quantity, right?
[03:09:55.740 --> 03:09:57.960]   We can get so much more done.
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:09:59.260]   And if you think about it,
[03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:01.660]   like I mean, you talk about like
[03:10:01.660 --> 03:10:04.100]   elite performing competitive teams.
[03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:10.100]   It's all about, like if you saw how much video analysis
[03:10:10.100 --> 03:10:13.460]   and time the Boston Celtics coaching staff puts in
[03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:17.020]   to what ends up being like a 35-second clip
[03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:19.300]   that's shown to a player or the team,
[03:10:19.300 --> 03:10:24.300]   like it's so much work to then the most potent thing, right?
[03:10:24.300 --> 03:10:25.980]   It's like when you're an elite,
[03:10:25.980 --> 03:10:30.980]   'cause like the players are doing something so intense,
[03:10:30.980 --> 03:10:34.860]   right, like it's all about quality, not quantity.
[03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:37.340]   They're not training basketball 17 hours a day.
[03:10:37.340 --> 03:10:39.940]   They could not possibly play then.
[03:10:39.940 --> 03:10:43.020]   Or they're training brilliantly for like,
[03:10:43.020 --> 03:10:46.540]   you know, maybe an hour and a half a day, brilliantly,
[03:10:46.540 --> 03:10:48.900]   but like scientifically, right?
[03:10:48.900 --> 03:10:50.180]   Or if they're competing, if they're playing
[03:10:50.180 --> 03:10:52.820]   for a two and a half to three hour game, right?
[03:10:52.820 --> 03:10:54.400]   Then what's the way to optimize for that?
[03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:56.060]   You don't stack six hours of training in
[03:10:56.060 --> 03:10:58.420]   before three hour game, no.
[03:10:58.420 --> 03:11:00.900]   So much of it is, you know, body work and setting some tape
[03:11:00.900 --> 03:11:03.020]   and then being primed in the right way
[03:11:03.020 --> 03:11:05.260]   to remember what you're looking at on tape
[03:11:05.260 --> 03:11:07.120]   and then taking breaks and returning to it.
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:09.540]   And then you're like understanding exactly
[03:11:09.540 --> 03:11:11.060]   how much load is on your body and your mind
[03:11:11.060 --> 03:11:12.740]   and having your sleep right and your nutrition right
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:13.940]   and getting everything optimized
[03:11:13.940 --> 03:11:16.860]   and then being a peak performer when it's on, right?
[03:11:16.860 --> 03:11:18.380]   But we don't have that discipline
[03:11:18.380 --> 03:11:20.220]   as mental beings very often,
[03:11:20.220 --> 03:11:22.140]   but we should in our creative process,
[03:11:22.140 --> 03:11:24.340]   in our relationships, right?
[03:11:24.340 --> 03:11:26.380]   In the art of being a mom or a dad
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:29.380]   or a husband or a wife or a friend.
[03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:31.220]   Like why wouldn't we be cultivating ourselves
[03:11:31.220 --> 03:11:32.860]   and being brilliant at that?
[03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:34.700]   Like I really believe in quality as a way of life.
[03:11:34.700 --> 03:11:36.820]   That's another very important principle for me.
[03:11:36.820 --> 03:11:38.760]   That we're either practicing sloppiness
[03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:40.600]   or practicing quality.
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:44.040]   If we do something shitty, then we're practicing shitty.
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:45.920]   And that will, just how like we can harness
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:48.880]   the thematic interconnectedness on the positive side,
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:50.240]   we can also really harness it brilliantly
[03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:51.660]   on the negative side.
[03:11:51.660 --> 03:11:53.160]   Every time we practice being sloppiness,
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:55.280]   we're using thematic interconnectedness
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:57.440]   to be sloppy in everything.
[03:11:57.440 --> 03:11:58.940]   I really believe that.
[03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:00.680]   So quality as a way of life is a beautiful way
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:01.760]   to practice quality everywhere
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:04.600]   'cause it will manifest everywhere, right?
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:06.560]   Not in a way that's like robotic or constrictive.
[03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:09.360]   No, in a way that's self-expressive and beautiful.
[03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:11.720]   - Living one's life like a work of art.
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:14.200]   - Yes, beautiful, amen.
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:15.680]   Let's do it.
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:16.960]   - Well, clearly you are.
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:20.160]   - I'm in the fight, man.
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:22.360]   - You're in the fight and you're setting
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:26.880]   an incredible example and you have your entire life,
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:31.120]   which is remarkable and so deeply appreciated.
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:33.960]   I have to say, and now I will reveal this,
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:35.940]   that when I started this podcast,
[03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:37.920]   I had a short list of people
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:40.880]   that would be kind of like pinch me guests,
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:42.960]   not because I want the guests to pinch me, but like, wow,
[03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:45.480]   like, I can't believe I'm sitting down with blank.
[03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:47.720]   And you were on that list.
[03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:49.160]   I've read "The Art of Learning".
[03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:52.000]   I've, you know, I watched and read everything I could
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:53.420]   about your work.
[03:12:53.420 --> 03:12:56.960]   And I did see the "Search for Bobby Fischer"
[03:12:56.960 --> 03:12:59.420]   with the understanding that that's accurate
[03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:01.600]   about certain things and probably inaccurate about others.
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:02.680]   So if people choose to watch that,
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:03.680]   they should keep that in mind.
[03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:04.720]   It is Hollywood.
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:09.440]   More importantly, you've had this chance
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:10.440]   to sit down and do this.
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:15.360]   And I have to say, I gained so much
[03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:20.360]   from your incredible precision,
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:25.480]   but also scope of observation in the world
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:27.240]   because I'm not a basketball player.
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:28.400]   I don't know how to play chess.
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:31.760]   And yet I've learned so much from you
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:33.960]   and your writings and your teachings
[03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:37.480]   and just the chance to sit down here and to learn from you.
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:39.320]   I know I'm speaking on behalf of myself
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:41.520]   and literally millions of people.
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:44.080]   I just want to say thank you for living your life
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:49.080]   like a work of art and for incorporating, you know,
[03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:53.840]   public education, which is what we're doing here
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:57.520]   into this set of pursuits that, you know,
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:14:00.440]   you've been after one after the other,
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:05.120]   but that are bound by this set of core themes.
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:07.280]   So without getting too abstract,
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:09.560]   I just want to say thank you so much for coming here,
[03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:11.960]   for educating us, for making us think.
[03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:13.920]   I know it's going to change people's thoughts
[03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:15.940]   and behavior for the better.
[03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:19.280]   And the only question left is to say,
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:22.280]   would you please come back and talk to us again more?
[03:14:22.280 --> 03:14:23.120]   - Absolutely, man.
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:24.320]   Thank you for what you've just said.
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:25.160]   It's an honor.
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:28.240]   And I've learned so much from this jam.
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:29.880]   It feels like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:31.400]   So just the beginning.
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:32.760]   - I feel the same way.
[03:14:32.760 --> 03:14:33.600]   I look forward to it.
[03:14:33.600 --> 03:14:34.420]   - Thank you, man.
[03:14:34.420 --> 03:14:35.260]   - Thank you.
[03:14:35.260 --> 03:14:36.960]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:38.280]   with Josh Waitzkin.
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:39.640]   To learn more about Josh's work
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:41.760]   and to find a link to his book, "The Art of Learning,"
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:43.880]   which by the way, I highly recommend,
[03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:45.800]   please see the show note captions.

[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:08.800]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast

[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:14.680]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:16.560]   I do read all the comments.
[03:15:16.560 --> 03:15:18.980]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:21.820]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:15:21.820 --> 03:15:24.680]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:26.880]   Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn.
[03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:28.200]   And on all those platforms,
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:30.380]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:15:30.380 --> 03:15:31.880]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:33.280]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:35.280]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:36.760]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:40.200]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:15:40.200 --> 03:15:41.340]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:15:41.340 --> 03:15:42.540]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:44.160]   It's my very first book.
[03:15:44.160 --> 03:15:45.560]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:47.720]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:48.880]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:50.040]   for more than five years,
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:52.360]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:53.920]   of research and experience.
[03:15:53.920 --> 03:15:56.980]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
[03:15:56.980 --> 03:15:59.480]   to exercise to stress control,
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:01.920]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:05.280]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:07.360]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:09.080]   The book is now available by presale
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:11.260]   at protocolsbook.com.
[03:16:11.260 --> 03:16:13.640]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:15.400]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:17.160]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:19.680]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:16:19.680 --> 03:16:21.160]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:22.960]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:16:22.960 --> 03:16:24.160]   the Neural Network newsletter
[03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:26.120]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:28.320]   that includes everything from podcast summaries
[03:16:28.320 --> 03:16:29.500]   to what we call protocols
[03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:32.180]   in the form of brief one- to three-page PDFs
[03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:34.860]   that cover things like how to optimize your sleep,
[03:16:34.860 --> 03:16:36.540]   how to regulate your dopamine.
[03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:39.660]   We also have protocols related to deliberate cold exposure,
[03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:41.460]   get a lot of questions about that,
[03:16:41.460 --> 03:16:43.460]   deliberate heat exposure, and on and on.
[03:16:43.460 --> 03:16:45.540]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[03:16:45.540 --> 03:16:47.460]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:16:47.460 --> 03:16:49.560]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:51.660]   scroll down to newsletter, and enter your email.
[03:16:51.660 --> 03:16:54.380]   And I should mention that we do not share your email
[03:16:54.380 --> 03:16:55.420]   with anybody.
[03:16:55.420 --> 03:16:56.860]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:16:56.860 --> 03:16:59.580]   for today's discussion with Josh Waitzkin.
[03:16:59.580 --> 03:17:01.780]   And last but certainly not least,
[03:17:01.780 --> 03:17:03.940]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:17:03.940 --> 03:17:06.520]   (upbeat music)
[03:17:06.520 --> 03:17:08.280]   (upbeat music)
