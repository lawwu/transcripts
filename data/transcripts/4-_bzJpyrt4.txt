[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   A podcast listener named Marna writes in, "Hello Pastor John, I'm a physician in Canada
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.760]   that would soon face requests from my patients regarding assisted dying for possibly the
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.480]   elderly, the chronically ill, or for cancer patients.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   Legislation would soon be approved.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.440]   How do I have such a conversation with patients and family given the fact that it is not God's
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.200]   perfect will and not Christ or gospel-centered?
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.720]   What is your view on this, Pastor John?"
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.040]   You know, the first thing that comes to my mind right now as we're talking, which hadn't
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.520]   come to mind before as I was thinking about this kind of issue, is that the phrase she
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.720]   used, "assisted dying," that's a tricky phrase.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.200]   Instead of assisted suicide, assisted dying.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.360]   Nobody's going to have a problem with assisted dying if assisted dying means, "Give me a
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.840]   drug please to help the pain not be so great as I'm dying."
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.080]   So that phrase is one of those slippery, it just kind of galls me that when we invent
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.240]   phrases that are okay in one sense and not okay in another, and then we use them to talk
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.200]   about what's not okay and thus muddy the water.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.040]   Well anyway, that just came to my mind as I was hearing you ask me the question afresh.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   But here I have a whole lot of thoughts about this, and it seems to me we should start with
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.560]   some clear things and then end with some ambiguous things, because I really, really sympathize
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.340]   with the ambiguities that doctors especially and family members face in these moments.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.160]   But establishing what's clear will help us with the ambiguities, I think.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:55.120]   Number one, it seems clear to me that Christian conviction is the dominant control of the
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.680]   behavior of a Christian, rather than any laws passed by governments.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.800]   We submit to laws as Christians, but not if they contradict clear biblical convictions.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.360]   So no law concerning physician-assisted suicide should be the guide for a Christian doctor
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.640]   in what he or she is willing to do.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.560]   That's clear thing number one.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   Number two, God wants us to obey him even if we can't see all the good fruit that will
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.920]   come or that he designs to come from our obedience.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.360]   God usually gives some of his reasons for his commands, but leaves many of those reasons
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.940]   for us to discover long after the act of obedience, even decades or centuries after.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.800]   Sometimes God commands us to do something, and only much later do we or the world discover
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.440]   how many good effects come from obeying God and/or would have come if we had obeyed God.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.600]   So that's the second clear thing.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.280]   God wants obedience even if we can't see all the good that will come.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:20.240]   Third clear thing is that both Old and New Testament command us not to murderâ€”that
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.720]   is, not to take the life of an innocent person who doesn't deserve to be put to death.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.840]   Romans 13:9, for example.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.360]   The Bible underscores this command repeatedly by using various phrases, and one dominant
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.440]   one is "Don't shed innocent blood," 19 times in the Bible, telling us to cleanse
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.040]   our land from the shedding of innocent blood, which is a circumlocution of "Don't take
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.820]   the life of a person who doesn't deserve to have his life taken away."
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:05.900]   Number four, the fourth clear thing that it seems to me stands out in this discussion.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.400]   Human life, which is distinct from all other earthly life in being created in the image
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.980]   of God and designed to exist forever, is the gift of God, and He owns it and may do with
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.340]   it as He pleases, take it any time He pleases, without wronging anyone, and this is His unique
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.340]   prerogative.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:39.700]   1 Timothy 6:13, "He gives life to all things," or Deuteronomy 32:39, "See, now I, even
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.180]   I am He, and there is no God besides Me.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.860]   I take life, and I make alive.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.780]   I wound, and I heal.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.740]   There is none that can deliver out of My hand," or 1 Samuel 2:6, "The Lord takes
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.360]   life and brings to life.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.640]   He brings down to Sheol and raises up," or James 4:15, "Instead, you ought to say,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.460]   if the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.180]   Now, it seems to me that all those passages from the Bible teach that giving and taking
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.580]   life is ultimately God's right.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.820]   Human life, in its fullest sense, is a miracle that only He can create and only He has the
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:37.740]   right to take, unless He has given the state the right to use the sword in various settings
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.360]   to take life.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.060]   But as far as medical things are concerned, I think it is clear God's rights are at
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.780]   stake here, and we dare not intrude on what He alone has the right to do.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:02.100]   A fifth clear thing is the truth that physicians historically have been life-givers and life-sustainers,
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.820]   not life-takers.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.420]   The Hippocratic Oath that goes back four or five centuries before Christ has guided physicians
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:17.140]   for centuries, and it's got a sentence in it like this, "Nor shall any man's entreaty
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:25.420]   prevail upon me to administer poison to anyone, neither will I counsel any man to do so.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.460]   Moreover, I will give no sort of medicine to any pregnant woman with a view to destroy
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.460]   the child."
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.660]   That's the Hippocratic Oath for babies in the womb and old people outside the womb.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.000]   And so it's just a clear thing historically.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.580]   This is what doctors do.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.900]   They've pledged themselves not to use their remarkable gifting to take life.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:59.940]   A sixth clear thing is that suffering, human suffering, is horrible beyond words in some
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.620]   cases, and it is right and loving for physicians to use whatever medicines they have at their
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.540]   disposal if the patient wants it, to minimize the pain of their patients.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.300]   Nothing I say should be considered to contradict that, and I think it could be shown from Scripture
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:25.700]   that the fall of man into all the miseries that we have doesn't justify the refusal
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.100]   to help men avoid being in pain.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.160]   And a seventh truth is that suffering is not viewed in the Bible as the worst thing.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.060]   The Bible describes how God often uses it for good and wise and loving purposes, and
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:53.540]   therefore suffering never becomes such an evil, so great that it justifies disobedience
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.140]   to one of the commands of God, like the command not to take innocent life.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.380]   So you can see where those, what, seven things lead.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:11.940]   I don't think a Christian physician will use his or her skill to take a person's life or
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.660]   help someone else take it.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.820]   Now here's what remains ambiguous.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:26.340]   The line between taking life and not unduly sustaining life is not always clear.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.340]   That's the rub.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:35.480]   Yes, and I am admitting, I am saying that there are times when death should be allowed
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:42.860]   to run its course or to arrive naturally without any extraordinary efforts to keep a person
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.020]   alive.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.340]   Clearly death comes to all of us.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:58.740]   The wills that it come, discerning that time is not easy in these modern, remarkably wonderful
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.900]   medical days in which we live, which have created new possibilities for sustaining life
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.260]   beyond all ordinary means of life.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.100]   And so I'm just admitting great ambiguity here.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.860]   The will of the patient to live is one key factor.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:27.600]   Yes, strives to sustain life for a patient who desires life, but the will of a patient
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   to die is not a decisive word for the simple reason that many patients in the crisis of
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.900]   depression have attempted suicide, been rescued, and gone on to be thankful for the rest of
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.940]   their lives that someone contradicted their dark desires at that moment.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.180]   And there are other reasons.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:58.140]   So my conclusion is that we do not have the right to help a patient take his own life
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.560]   or the right to take it ourselves.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:08.340]   The laws that put such things into our hands are bad laws and should not constrain Christian
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.140]   physicians to act against their convictions, even if they have to lose their job in the
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.140]   process.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:23.500]   The ambiguities of end-of-life decisions regarding what is fitting life support and what blocks
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:29.980]   a timely, natural death, those decisions remain very, very difficult.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.860]   Pastor John, thank you for addressing the ambiguities and for holding this unswerving
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.900]   position on the preciousness of life for so many years.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.780]   And Marta, thank you for the excellent question.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.740]   These are the tricky pastoral questions that we address on the podcast five times a week.

[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.460]   Well tomorrow we're going to call Don Carson again, and if he's available, we'll have him
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:05.660]   explain the doctrine of creation and how those first two chapters in Genesis correspond to
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.620]   really everything else in theology.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.660]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
