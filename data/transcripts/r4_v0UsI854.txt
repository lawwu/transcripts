[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   In the last podcast, in episode 61, we talked about your goals of using Twitter, and I want
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.080]   to pick up on that discussion here.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.640]   Pastor John, what are some strategies for stewarding a Twitter platform well?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.840]   One is practice a fast.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.680]   In other words, kick up a period of time, week, or like for me, two years ago, eight
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.200]   months, zero Twitter, zero blogging, and see what happens to your soul.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   See if your soul has become addicted to being known, being followed, being read, and just
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.440]   don't even write anymore and don't read anymore for X amount of time.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.840]   That's a Twitter fast or a blogging fast.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.280]   The last thing I would say is pray over every tweet.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.280]   Just say, "God bless this," even if it's a joke, even if you're pointing to money-winning
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.240]   humor, say, like Kevin DeYoung does on his blog.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.360]   Money-mourning humor.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.160]   I do not doubt that Kevin chooses very consciously why he does that, thinks it through, prays
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.920]   over it, and I think that's what we all should do.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   Do you check your mentions or comments from followers to hear what they're saying about
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.800]   things you've posted on Twitter?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.080]   Every now and then, I do and I don't really find it that helpful because for every person
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.440]   who says, "Thank you.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   It was a great help.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.520]   Somebody has given me the F word."
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.480]   I don't think I can look enough to draw any valid conclusions.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.040]   I'd have to look at it and do some sophisticated analysis to say, "Okay, 72% of the people
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.000]   said they got help and 30% thought it was hogwash.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.760]   Surely the 70% are right."
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.000]   Well, maybe, maybe not.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.120]   For me, it's much more spiritually safe to go to the Lord and say, "Here's something
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.040]   I think would be helpful for me to say," to think through how to say it best and then
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.760]   say it, and then I've got you and David and Jonathan and Marshall and Josh and John and
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.480]   Scott who I'm going to believe if it wasn't helpful, they're coming back to me.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480]   So Josh did that.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   Josh sent me a nice paragraph saying that one of the tweets I sent out just wasn't worded
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.640]   in a way that was helpful and I said, "You're right.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   You're right."
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.240]   So I didn't need to do any research.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.400]   I've got you guys around me to help me.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.080]   Maybe not everybody has that, but frankly, I'm so wired to love the praise of men that
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.760]   for me, it's more spiritually unhelpful to read what's being said than to just keep speaking.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Here's kind of the way I view media like this.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.720]   I'm basically a writer-preacher for a church and for books and for conferences, and I want
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.480]   my preaching ministry to be the main thing and my wider writing ministry.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.080]   Twitter and these other things are spillover and I'm just scattering.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.800]   I exist to spread a passion for the Supremacy of God in all things, and I just want those
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   to be used as well as they can, but the bread and butter is over here on the more substantial
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.760]   things that I'm speaking and working on.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   Here's a related follow-up question.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   When you go to the DG blog and you look at the posts that you've written currently right
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.240]   now in the way that the website is designed, the Facebook and Twitter statistics are very
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240]   prominent.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.120]   You can see those right by the headline.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.960]   How do you read those statistics?
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.600]   What do those mean to you, if anything?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.960]   I'm not even sure what you're talking about.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.640]   Okay, excellent.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.760]   Well, on the DG blog to the right of the blog banner or the image at the top of the blog
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.240]   post, there will be a statistic for Facebook likes and retweets on Twitter.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.120]   Is it just a little gauge for the popularity of a post?
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.160]   All right, maybe I'll look at that.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.880]   So what was your question?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.920]   Okay, yeah, well that totally undermines the question, so we'll move on.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.000]   No, no, here in principle I can say this.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm glad.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.080]   I mean, I just got an email from Josh, who's Director of Communications at Desiring God
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.320]   this morning, reminding me what our goals were internationally for this year, and among
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.040]   those goals were generally on the blog, we want to see I think like a 20% increase of
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.000]   people who visit and for those outside non-English, I forget what, 35%, 40% increase.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.960]   Well now, that's a goal.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.760]   We exist to spread.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.640]   Our goal is not to have fewer and fewer people reading what we write on this blog.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.680]   Our goal is to spread, and therefore the people that are charged to strategically reach the
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.680]   greatest number of people have got to look at those statistics.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.960]   Are we reaching our goals?
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.100]   If not, would there be strategies we could follow that would help us reach more people
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.480]   without altering the truth that we love?
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   Excellent.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.040]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this awkward podcast.
