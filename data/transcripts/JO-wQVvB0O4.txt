[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.360]   the epistle to the Romans in chapter 8 and in verse 34. Paul's epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:23.080]   chapter 8 and verse 34. "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.040]   is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.840]   Now I want to deal in particular in this great statement with this wonderful phrase, "Yea,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:50.800]   rather, that is risen again." It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again,
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600]   who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Now I am
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.760]   calling attention to these words and especially the expression "Yea, rather," because it
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.600]   does seem to me to sum up in and of itself what is the essential and the central Christian
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.720]   affirmation. The very way in which the apostle puts it brings that before us in a very dramatic
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   manner. It is a kind of protest. It is an affirmation, as I say, a protestation, and
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.080]   it does sum up in itself what is the Christian hope and the essential glory of the Christian
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.040]   position. Now there is in this phrase, it seems to me, all the sense of triumph and
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:53.640]   of victory that characterizes the New Testament gospel. It is a gospel, it is good news, and
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.480]   we must never forget that. And if there is one thing that the message of the resurrection,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.000]   which we think of this Easter day, ought to bring home to us more forcibly than anything
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.640]   else, it is just this very note of victory and of triumph, this note of joy and of exhilaration.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.880]   No one can read the end of the four gospels without being aware of this. We are given
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.080]   all the details about the crucifixion of our Lord and the dejection that surrounds the
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.640]   whole event and the dejection that followed it, the despair and the hopelessness, the
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.840]   disconsolate condition of the apostles themselves. Then suddenly there breaks upon us this great
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.280]   event and the way in which, fumbling and uncertain, they discovered it and were made aware of
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   it and at last realized its significance and its import. And the whole atmosphere immediately
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.960]   changes. Now all that I say is conveyed by these words,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.320]   "It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again." You have got it all there,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.760]   and that is why it does seem to me to epitomize so perfectly this essential spirit of the
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.040]   New Testament message. You get it, of course, inevitably in the book of the Acts of the
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.880]   Apostles. There is no doubt at all that that is the most exhilarating book in the world.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.600]   Though it starts so inauspiciously with just a handful of men, you feel the note of triumph
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.720]   and authority. You see Peter preaching on that day of Pentecost. It is all because of
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.040]   this great fact and event of the resurrection and how they went throughout the world preaching
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.520]   and proclaiming these glad tidings, as they call them. And you feel the same note running
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.760]   right through the remainder of the book, the remainder of the New Testament. And indeed
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.560]   it is there in the very last book of all, of course, inevitably, because it is all a
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.000]   revelation from this risen Lord Jesus Christ. Well, now then, I am calling attention to
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.080]   it in order that we may remind ourselves of this very fact. The Christian, essentially
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.720]   and primarily, is to be a person who has a sense of victory, a sense of joy, a sense
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.360]   of assurance, a sense of hope. Those of us who meet regularly here Sunday by Sunday
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.400]   have been considering this great question of assurance since the very beginning of this
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.760]   year. We have been reminding ourselves in terms of the great statement in the first
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.880]   chapter in the very prologue of the Gospel according to St. John, that as many as received
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.920]   him to them gave he power to become the sons of God. And as Christians we are the children
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.240]   or the sons of God. And there is nothing more important and vital than that we should be
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.920]   certain of that, that we should have an absolute assurance. There is nothing that is more foreign
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   to the New Testament atmosphere than this notion that members of the Christian church
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.560]   are those who are painfully warily trying to make themselves Christians, and who spend
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.960]   their time in bemoaning their sins trying to be better, but ever failing. It is an utter
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.880]   travesty of Christianity. The Christian church, again, if she gives the impression of a mournful
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.240]   society, that she is a gathering of people who have given up certain things but who have
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.240]   got very little in return, but who are in a spirit of fear, just painfully trying not
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.160]   to sin. Again, I say it is an utter travesty of what one gets in the New Testament itself.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.080]   The picture here is one of triumph. It is one of assurance. A Christian is not a man
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.440]   who is hoping to be saved. The Christian, the true Christian, is a man who knows that
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:06.200]   he is saved, and who is rejoicing in that knowledge, and is full of a spirit of victory
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.160]   and of triumph and of hope. Now, that is the very thing I say of which we are reminded,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.920]   by the very way in which the apostle puts it here. His theme in this section of this
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:24.800]   great eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans is this very theme of assurance. It
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.840]   is the great theme of the final perseverance of the saints. He starts off by saying, "What
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.120]   shall we say then to these things?" And he answers, "If God be for us, who can be against
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.960]   us? He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.760]   also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.560]   It is God himself that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died,
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.680]   yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.640]   intercession for us, and on and on he goes." Now, the theme is assurance, certainty, the
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.280]   final perseverance of the saints. It does not matter what comes to meet us, or what
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:28.040]   may be set against us. The Christian saint is invincible, and his ultimate glory is something
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.960]   that is sure and final. And therefore, the thing for us to discover is, how does one
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   arrive at that great assurance, that great note of joy and of victory and of triumph?
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.520]   And the answer is, of course, that it is to be found primarily and most essentially in
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:55.000]   this great theme of the resurrection. And so the apostle puts it in this form. Here
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.840]   it is, here is the turning point, yea, rather. Now then, what does it tell us, what does
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:10.000]   it convey to us? Why is it that our position is finally based upon this great fact of the
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.360]   resurrection? And the first answer to the question is this, that it proves, of course,
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:23.680]   who our Lord is. And this is something that he keeps on repeating. He started off his
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.600]   great epistle by making this very point. He says that he is an apostle separated unto
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   the gospel of God, which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures. What
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.360]   is this gospel? Well, it is this. It is concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.520]   of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:55.680]   according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead. That is the thing.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.800]   It proclaims that. And therefore, of course, it is an essential part of the whole Christian
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.240]   faith. The record, as I say, makes quite plain and clear to us that it was the fact of the
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.560]   resurrection that finally convinced even the apostles themselves that Jesus of Nazareth
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.800]   was indeed and in truth the eternal Son of God. And therefore, our whole position depends
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:31.760]   upon this. There is no salvation for us unless he has arisen. Here is the first that has
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.880]   risen from the dead. He is unique, and he is unique because he is the Son of God.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.720]   Very well, then, there is the first great thing, of course, that causes this triumph
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.400]   and this sense of rejoicing. As Christians, we are people who believe and say that God
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.720]   has visited and redeemed his people, and he has done so in and through the person of his
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.880]   only begotten Son. But let us go on from there to work out more of what the apostle puts
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.520]   immediately before us here. The second great thing which is proved and established by the
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.960]   resurrection is this. It is a demonstration of the fact that our Lord's work upon the
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:20.120]   cross was indeed complete. Now, that is the thing the apostle has got in his mind. Who
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.800]   is going to condemn us, he says? Who can bring any charge against God's elect? There are
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.160]   the demands of the law of God, the demands of the righteousness of God. There is the
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.000]   devil who is the accuser of the brethren. Who is going to answer these charges? That
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.440]   is the matter, he says. Well, you say the answer is the cross on Calvary's hill. It
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:53.720]   is Christ that died. He died because he was bearing our sins and bearing our guilt. He
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.740]   said, sir, he said that he had come not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:06.520]   make his life, to give his life a ransom for many. And that is the great teaching, that
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:13.320]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. All right, very well. It is Christ that died.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.280]   He has taken our place. He is answering God's demands and the demands of the holy law of
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.760]   God upon those of us who believe in him. Ah, yes, but the question that arises in our minds
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:35.200]   is this. Was even he able to do that? Was his death sufficient? Did he really receive
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.000]   the punishment of my sins? Has he really satisfied the demands of God's law? Is there not some
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.320]   further demand that can be made somewhere? That is the question the apostle is raising.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Who is he that can condemn him? And,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:01.120]   you see, the mere fact of the death upon the cross, glorious and central and vital though
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.400]   it is, would never give us final assurance. We might still say, ah, the weight of sin
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:16.040]   was even too much for him. It killed him, and it killed him finally. And we would have
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:22.000]   no answer. If the devil arose and said that to us, we'd be unable to reply to him. But,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.280]   this is where the "Yea, rather" comes in. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:32.400]   elect? Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died. Wonderful thing. He loved me so
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.000]   much he took my sins. I lay my sins on him. They've gone. Yes, but do I know that I'm
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.320]   forgiven? And there's only one answer. It is Christ that died. Yea, rather, that is
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:53.600]   risen again. Here's my assurance. How? Well, the apostle has already told us, as a matter
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.120]   of fact, at the end of chapter 4, where he put it like this. He said he was delivered
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:10.440]   for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification. That's it. You see, he's
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.240]   writing about Abram, and he says these things, "It was not written for his sake alone that
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.480]   it was imputed to him, but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offenses."
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   Yes, but as I say, that isn't enough. "Was raised again for our justification," in order
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:44.680]   to proclaim our justification. In other words, the resurrection is really this. It is God's
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:53.880]   way of proclaiming and announcing to the whole world that the work of his Son was sufficient.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:00.120]   God set him forth as a propitiation for our sins on the cross. God sets him forth in the
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   fact, the mighty fact of the resurrection, to proclaim that he's satisfied. All the demands
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:15.040]   of the law have been fulfilled. The punishment of every single sin has been meted out. He
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:22.000]   bore it all. God is well pleased, and he gives a declaration of it by raising him again from
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.680]   the dead. Or, if you like, you can look at it like this. It is in the resurrection that
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:36.960]   you see that he was indeed strong enough and able enough to bear the weight of all this
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:43.920]   guilt upon himself. He could not be held even by death. He's conquered it. That's the last
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.080]   demand where he's paid it. He's broken us under the bands of death. These are the great
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:56.680]   terms that are used by the New Testament as it puts this momentous event before us. So
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.000]   it's not surprising that the apostle, as it were, almost corrects himself and says, "It
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.800]   is Christ that died." "Yea, rather, what am I talking about? Christ died, yes, but Christ
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:14.680]   risen again. Yea, rather." And he's even at the right hand of God, and ever living to
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.520]   make intercession for us. Very well, then, you see the importance of our laying hold
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:28.680]   on this. There should be no uncertainty in our minds as to whether our sins are forgiven.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.600]   The resurrection is a declaration of it. God has taken your sins and mine and has laid
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.920]   them upon him. And he has dealt with them there, and he's punished them, and Christ
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:44.960]   has borne the punishment. Here's the proof. God is proclaiming it. They've all been dealt
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:51.000]   with. So the apostle started off this great eighth chapter by saying this. Here's a proclamation,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.800]   which is only possible in the light of the resurrection. "There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:06.080]   to them that are in Christ Jesus." There isn't any. There never can be any. There never will
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.040]   be any. And you see, the whole object he has in mind is to give assurance of this to people.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.600]   "Ah, but you see, I still sin, and I'm aware of my sinfulness. I know, my friend, of course
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.320]   you are, so am I, so is everybody else." But you're not to look at yourself and your sin,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.520]   you are to look at this risen, resurrected Christ. He's borne your sins, every one of
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:36.760]   them. He's the Lamb of God that's taken away the sin of the world. All your sins that you've
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.080]   ever committed, all the sins you are committing, and I don't hesitate to add, every sin that
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.960]   you ever will commit, have all been laid upon him on Calvary. They've been dealt with. There
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.760]   is no condemnation. There never will be. Look at the way the Apostle John works out that
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:03.200]   argument. He was doing exactly the same thing in his first epistle. He writes, he says,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.960]   that these people may have joy, that they may know the joy of the apostles themselves.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:19.680]   "These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full." Now then, how is this possible?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.720]   This then, he says, is the message that we have heard of him and declare unto you. And
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:33.280]   this is to make us full of joy, remember. This is the message, that God is light, and
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:43.680]   in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we are fellowship with him and walk in darkness,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:50.880]   we lie and we do not the truth. Where's the joy, you say? Is that the way we are given
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:58.440]   joy? By being reminded that God is light and that in him is no darkness at all? And that
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.720]   if we say that we know him and walk with him and nevertheless are walking in darkness,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:10.600]   we are liars and we are not doing the truth. But listen. "But if we walk in the light
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.880]   as he is in the light, we are fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.800]   his Son cleanseth us from all sin." What blood is that? That's the blood that was
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.040]   shed once and forever on Calvary. It's not being shed. That's finished. That's, he
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.560]   said on the cross, "It is finished." That's ended. The blood has been shed. It's that
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.840]   blood that once was shed that covers us forever and forever. The blood of Jesus Christ his
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:45.720]   Son goes on cleansing us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:55.960]   and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he, God, is faithful and just to
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:05.240]   forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. You notice? He is faithful
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:13.000]   and just. What's it mean? Well, it means this, that God has said that he has laid your
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.480]   sins upon his Son and that he's punished them. And if he now punishes you again for
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:26.120]   your sins, he is no longer just. He's faithful to his word and he's just. God doesn't
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   punish sins twice. That would be unjust. God has punished your sins, therefore he won't
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.720]   punish you. He's already punished them in him. He is faithful and just to forgive us
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:43.200]   our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. That's the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.600]   And of course this is all brought home to us, I say, by this great and mighty effect
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:56.000]   of the resurrection of the Lord. It is Christ that died, yea, rather, and here's my comfort,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.360]   that he is risen again. And there is my proclamation that my sins were laid on Jesus, that they
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:10.720]   have been dealt with, that he bore the punishment, paid the price, and I am free. No condemnation
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.080]   to them that are in Christ Jesus. There is no enemy anywhere on earth or in hell or anywhere
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:26.280]   else who can rise and condemn me. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.840]   rather, that is risen again. There's my answer. Very well, let's go on.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:43.000]   In the third place, the resurrection proves and establishes his invincible power over
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:53.960]   all our enemies. Now this is a very vital and all important point. The object of salvation
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:21:00.400]   is of course to deliver us, and to deliver us from our various enemies. What are the
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:11.520]   enemies of men? The enemies of men are the devil, the world, the flesh, sin. And because
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:21.560]   we are sinners, the law of God itself has become our enemy. It condemns us. And the
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.880]   Son of God came into this world in order to redeem us and in order to save us and to save
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.320]   us from all our foes, from all our enemies. That was the message that was given even to
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:41.200]   Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist. And what we want to know is if all our enemies
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.720]   have really been dealt with and have been conquered. And this is where the resurrection
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:55.280]   is so vitally important. We see as we read the pages of the four Gospels that our Lord
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:01.840]   kept the law perfectly. He never disobeyed his father. We see him dealing with devils,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.080]   exorcising them, casting them out. We see him in direct mortal combat with the devil
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:13.280]   himself and routing him and defeating him. He conquered the world, of course. He never
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:21.880]   sinned. And there on Calvary's cross we see him again, I say, fulfilling the law negatively
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:30.120]   as well as positively by bearing our sins and their punishment. But still we want to
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:42.560]   ask our final question. There is a lost enemy. The lost enemy that shall be destroyed is
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:54.960]   death. That's 1 Corinthians 5, 26. The lost enemy. Here's an enemy, a powerful, mighty
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.520]   enemy. You remember what the author of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us about him.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:08.480]   "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood," Hebrews 2, 14, "he
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:16.680]   also himself likewise took part of the same. In order that, through death, he might destroy
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.160]   him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:32.000]   of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage." The lost enemy, death, with his
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:41.760]   scythe waiting for us all. Always there, this terrible spectre, always coming nearer and
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   nearer. And the whole of humanity from the beginning has lived in the fear of death all
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:52.880]   their lifetime were subject to bondage. Even the most arrogant man in the world this morning
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.280]   who says he isn't afraid of death is afraid of it in his heart. He puts on a bold front.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.960]   He whistles to keep up his courage in the dark, like a little boy going through a church
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:08.480]   at that night. Oh, but it's mere pretense. The spectre of death, the last enemy who conquers
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:14.040]   all, doesn't matter who they are, nor however great, nor however powerful. The last enemy
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:20.280]   that shall be conquered is death. Here is the foe that brings down and has brought down
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:28.720]   the mightiest of the mighty, the conqueror of all. And what the human race has longed
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:35.560]   for, says this man, in this second chapter of Hebrews, has been the knowledge that someone
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.000]   can deliver us from the bondage of the fear of death, and to be able to look into the
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.720]   face of death and smile because we know that he's conquered, though he is the last enemy.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:53.680]   And here's the answer. It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again. He
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:00.560]   burst us under the bends of death. He rose triumphant o'er the grave. Here, of course,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:09.720]   is the glorious triumphing which is celebrated in 1 Corinthians 15. So when this corruptible
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.520]   shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   be brought to pass the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory." Oh,
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:30.960]   death, where is thy sting? Oh, grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin,
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.760]   and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   our Lord Jesus Christ. Christian people, do you believe in the resurrection? Do you believe
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.720]   in the fact of the resurrection? Very well, then, do you stand with me this morning and
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   look into the face of death and say, "Oh, death, where is thy sting?" Can you look
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:04.400]   into your own open grave and say, "Oh, grave, where is thy victory?" You don't really
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:12.080]   believe in the resurrection unless you can say that. Are you still afraid of death, my
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.280]   friend? Are you still afraid of the grave? You shouldn't be. Christ is risen. He's
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:25.160]   conquered it. Death is a defeated foe. He's brought life and immortality to light. Death
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.000]   is just a little gateway that separates this land of sin and woe and shame from that land
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.720]   of pure delight where saints immortal reign. Have you got this, yea, brother, in your experience?
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:50.960]   Do you know that he's triumphed and prevailed even over the last enemy, death himself? Very
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.160]   well, let's go on and follow the apostle, because the next thing he tells us the resurrection
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:05.000]   leads us to know is this, that it leads to his ascension. It is Christ that died, yea,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.280]   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:23.200]   for us. What does this mean? Well, this is the great ground of assurance, that he, having
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:31.400]   conquered all our enemies, has taken his seat there at the right hand of God's power, and
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:40.600]   there he is as our representative. And there he is making intercession for us. That doesn't
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.200]   mean that he's pleading that we might be forgiven. He's done that. He did that on the cross,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.360]   and when he entered in with his own blood, he doesn't have to persuade God to forgive
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.960]   us. God sent him in order that he might forgive us. Let's get rid of that foolish notion
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.160]   that God needs to be persuaded to forgive us by the pleadings of his Son. That's happened.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.720]   God sent him to do that. It was God who was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.000]   Making intercession for us doesn't mean that. What does it mean? Well, it means looking
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.880]   after our interests. If you want to know what it means, you've simply got to read the
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:21.880]   17th chapter of John's Gospel. And in that 17th chapter of John's Gospel, you've got
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:28.240]   our Lord's great intercessory prayer. He makes intercession there for his people, and
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.720]   he doesn't once pray that they may be forgiven. What he prays for is our well-being in this
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.440]   world. He says, "I pray not that thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that thou
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.400]   wouldest keep them from the evil one." That's his prayer. Read that 17th chapter of John
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.160]   when you go home, and you'll see what it means when it says that our Lord is making
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.240]   intercession for us. Never a mention of our sins. They've all been dealt with. That's
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.440]   been done. No, no. This is what he prays. "They are not of the world, even as I am
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.240]   not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth, as thou hast sent
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.520]   me into the world. Even so have I also sent them into the world, and for their sakes I
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:14.520]   sanctify myself." He prays that they may be one and so on. That's what he's interceding
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:24.000]   for. Our Lord knows the kind of world we are in. He was in it himself. He had to face it
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.960]   all. He was tempted in all points, like as we are, yet without sin. And he knew physical
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:35.760]   frailty and weakness. He knew disappointment. He knew treachery from friends. He knew everything
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:43.240]   that you and I can be subjected to. And he's there at the right hand of God. He's risen.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.200]   He didn't merely lay down his life and pay a price. He's risen, ever liveth to make
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:59.000]   intercession at the right hand of God. He is there to obtain for us everything we need.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Every needed grace, every needed strength. So the author of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.800]   puts it again in chapter 4, verse 16, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.040]   grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need." That's it. In
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.480]   other words, my dear friend, it means this, that as you and I go on through this evil
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.240]   world and know all its strange vicissitudes and are subject to all the slings and arrows
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.680]   of outrageous fortune and everything that the world and the flesh and the devil and
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:34.880]   hell can bring up against us, the one who's conquered over it all and triumphed and prevailed
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:41.300]   is there looking upon us and seeing that we get every needed supply. All the treasures
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:48.680]   of God's grace and wisdom are stored up in him. Very well, you see, the resurrection
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:54.280]   assures us of that. So it's not surprising that the apostle pulls himself up and says,
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:01.880]   "It is Christ that died." "Yea, rather, that he's risen again." "It's all right," he says.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:11.280]   And then look at it in this way. The fact that our Lord has risen from the dead is a
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:19.960]   guarantee in and of itself that you and I shall rise also. And not merely rise, but
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:28.080]   rise unto glory. Now, my friends, this is the marvelous thing. And I think that many
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:34.480]   of us modern Christians are in grave danger of forgetting this. Our whole conception of
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.720]   salvation is incomplete. We think that it's merely something that happens to our spirits
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:44.360]   and to our souls. Thank God it does, but you know it includes the whole man. The body's
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.960]   going to be raised. These feeble, frail bodies of ours, subject to tiredness and weariness,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.560]   subject to diseases and pestilences, these bodies of ours which are so imperfect are
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.480]   going to be raised. Listen to this. This is the apostle's great theme in this eighth
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.600]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Listen to him in verse 9. "You, he says, are not
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.920]   in the flesh, but in the Spirit. If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you, if any
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.880]   man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." Then he says, "If Christ be in you,
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.200]   the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness." Then he
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.440]   goes on, "And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.720]   raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken you. A mortal body is by his Spirit
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:41.440]   that dwelleth in you." If the Spirit of Christ is in you, very well, it's a guarantee that
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:48.000]   your very body is going to be raised up and quickened and made glorious like unto that
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.520]   of Christ. So he goes on and says it more specifically in verses 16 and following. Listen.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:02.400]   "The Spirit also beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God, and
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:12.200]   if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. If so be that we
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:19.320]   suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:26.160]   of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:33.440]   in us. For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.120]   the sons of God." Who are they? You and I, sons of God. "For the creature was made
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.520]   subject of vanity not willingly, but by reason of him was subjected the same in hope. Because
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.080]   the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:55.320]   liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   in pain together until now, and not only they but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:13.560]   of the Spirit. Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption." What's
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:21.160]   that? "To wit, the redemption of our body." Now then, Christian people, what guarantees
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:28.440]   all that to us is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ? We are in Christ. We are
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.680]   baptized into Christ. We have been crucified with him. We have died with him. We have been
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   buried with him. He has risen. We are risen. Yes, risen in Spirit. We are born again. We
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:42.800]   are new men. We have been raised with Christ. Yes, but even my body is going to be raised.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.520]   Not yet. We look forward to that. That's the adoption. "To wit, the redemption of
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:56.200]   the body itself." But it's coming. Because he was raised, we shall be raised. It's
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:02.920]   the whole argument of 1 Corinthians 15. He is simply the firstborn from among the dead.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:08.840]   He is simply the first to rise from the dead, as Paul put it to Agrippa and Festus. He is
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:15.160]   the first in a series. He is the head of the new humanity. "As in Adam all die, so in
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:21.880]   Christ shall all be made alive. As death came by one man, so life and resurrection shall
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:33.120]   come by another man, this second man, this last Adam." Christ is risen. We are risen.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:43.200]   And we shall rise. And our very bodies shall be changed as his body was changed. And we
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.560]   shall be glorified even as he was glorified. If we suffer with him, we shall also reign
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:59.760]   with him. Beloved, now are we the children of God. And it does not yet appear what we
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:06.320]   shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall see him as he is, and we shall be
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:14.640]   like him. That's resurrection. So it's coming. And it is coming for us. It's not surprising
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.440]   the apostle, as it were, pulls himself up. It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:30.240]   risen again. And we are going to rise with him. And thank God he is demonstrated in the
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:36.280]   resurrection that nothing can ever prevent it. You say, "Aren't you being a little bit
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   bold? Aren't you being carried away by your own thoughts and your own words? Is this real?
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.960]   Is this true? You've still got to live in this world. You've still got to confront the
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.920]   world, the flesh, the devil. You've got illness, sickness, old age, death coming." All right,
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.880]   my friend, listen. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:06.800]   loved us. For I am persuaded, I am certain, that neither death nor life nor angels nor
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:13.280]   principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:21.440]   any other creature, put in anything you like, call any creature from heaven or hell on earth
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:34.080]   or sea or sky, any other creature, shall be able to separate us who believe in him, who
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.480]   believe that he is the Son of God, who believe in the virgin birth and the incarnation, who
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.520]   believe in his miracles, who believe in his atoning sacrificial death that he bore our
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:52.880]   sins and our punishment, who believe in his literal physical resurrection. Nothing shall
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:38:03.080]   be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. How do
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.680]   I know it? Well, I know it in this way. All these powers were set against him, and when
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.720]   he was crucified they thought they triumphed. They were full of jubilation. They said, "At
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:20.000]   last we've got him. He's died. He's expired. He's given up the ghost. He's buried." They
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   thought they had triumphed. They made the mistake of eternity. He rose again. It is
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:37.560]   Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again. He's conquered them all, and he's
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:44.400]   conquered them for us. So he looks down upon us, I believe, at this moment from the glory,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.840]   and this is what he says to us, "Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God,
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.480]   believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.640]   have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you,
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:12.840]   I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also."
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:25.720]   Christian people, are you triumphing in Christ? Have you lost the fear of death and the grave?
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:31.960]   Do you know that you are destined for everlasting glory and to be like Christ, even in your
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:42.480]   body? Do you thrill at the notion? Are you moved by the very conception? "He that hath
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:51.280]   this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure." If you believe this, you will
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.560]   forsake the world in your mind and heart. You will live for him. You will prepare yourself
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:05.480]   for this glory that is coming, and you will rejoice in it with a joy unspeakable and full
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:20.880]   of glory. It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, that will come again
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:33.240]   and receive me, even me, unto himself. Blessed be his name.
