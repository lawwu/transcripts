[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.760]   Good afternoon, brothers. Good afternoon, brothers. If I can have your attention here
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:40.560]   in the worship center, we're going to share this time talking about enduring to the end.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:49.220]   There are wonderful breakouts all over the campus. If you need to head to another one,
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:01:03.540]   this is the time to get going. Get while the getting is good. And we'll say a word of prayer
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:13.120]   and meditate on God's Word together.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.220]   Heavenly Father, we bless you for the gift of this day and for the privilege of walking
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.420]   today in the assurance of our salvation, our faith in the finished work of the Lord Jesus
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:35.500]   Christ, who is our all-sufficient prophet, priest, and king. We thank you for this band
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:47.040]   of brothers who have pressed their way here to fellowship around your Word, to have our
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:57.180]   vision enlarged of the gospel mission you have entrusted to us, and to worship you in
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.140]   spirit and in truth. We've already been richly blessed over the course of this day already,
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.920]   and we look forward to all that you have in store for us. We pray for your sustaining
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.100]   grace and strengthening help for Dr. MacArthur. We pray your blessings on the entire leadership
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.220]   and membership of this church, and thank you for all of the staff and volunteers who serve
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.500]   us. And now as we turn our attention to your Word during this breakout, we pray that you
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.020]   would focus our minds, ready our hearts to receive with gentleness the implanted Word
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:55.100]   that is able to save our souls. Help me to speak your Word faithfully and clearly. Help
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.740]   each of us to receive your Word today as it truly is, your Word to us, not mere human
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:11.940]   opinion. And may Christ be exalted as the Word is explained, we pray. Amen.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:21.500]   The title of this breakout is "Enduring to the End, the Key to Finishing Well in Life
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:34.020]   and Ministry." In the preface to his book, "The Roots of Endurance," John Piper writes
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:47.740]   about challenging his members to be coronary Christians, not adrenaline Christians. Of
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:56.740]   course, adrenaline is not a bad thing. It gets a lot of us preachers through many long
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:09.460]   Sundays. But then that high on Sunday often leads to a crash on Monday. The heart works
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:22.020]   differently without attention or fanfare or reward. The heart just keeps beating, doing
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:36.400]   its work to sustain life through ups and downs, joys and sorrows, good days and bad days.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:46.480]   The coronary Christian endures to the end and that is all the more so for, if you will,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:59.020]   coronary ministers. If a minister is not careful, brothers, he can become an adrenaline junkie,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:08.780]   seeking the next high from some idea or book or method or program or influencer to help
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:19.240]   him get a little further or a little closer to his ministerial goals. And in the process,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:29.320]   that minister can forget that the heart of the matter is always the matter of the heart.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:39.340]   Proverbs 4:23 instructs us to, "Keep your heart with all vigilance. Guard your heart
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.200]   above everything else, for from it flow the springs of life." You can do a lot of work
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:57.440]   to keep the water clean downstream only to find a never-ending flow of trash and debris
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:10.120]   flowing in to remove. You must go upstream to ensure the water is pure at its source.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.700]   And I just want to remind us during this hour together that the bottom line of pastoral
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:25.640]   ministry is heartwork. Sure, we instruct the mind and exhort the will and correct the emotions
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   of those that we minister to, but the true heartwork of pastoral ministry starts with
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:45.760]   us, not with them. Second Timothy chapter 4 verse 5 ends with the instruction to fulfill
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:07:02.820]   your ministry. Anyone can start fast. Can you finish well? To finish well is to have
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:11.060]   a strong and healthy heart that endures to the end. And I believe, if you'll open your
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.580]   Bibles, first Timothy chapter 4 verses 11-16 shows us what it means to be a faithful and
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:31.380]   fruitful minister. Paul says, "Command and teach these things. Let no one despise you
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:41.460]   for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith,
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:50.020]   in purity. Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation,
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:57.220]   to teaching. Do not neglect the gift you have which was given you by prophecy when the council
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:06.220]   of elders laid their hands on you. Practice these things. Immerse yourself in them so
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:15.860]   that all may see your progress. Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:26.780]   in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers." Charles Bridges
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:33.220]   wrote, "This paragraph condenses in the smallest compass the most important body of appropriate
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:43.540]   instruction and encouragement for ministerial devotedness." There are 10 exhortations, 10
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:56.340]   imperatives, 10 commands in verses 11-16. But verse 16 records two exhortations that
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:08.420]   summarize them all. "Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:17.380]   for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers." Of course, Paul is saying
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:25.020]   nothing new to Timothy in this verse. The instructions that he gives in this verse are
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:33.860]   littered throughout the pastoral epistles. Yet these simple and succinct instructions
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:44.500]   encompasses the practice, the process, and the purpose of Christian ministry. John MacArthur
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:51.780]   has said, "Now is the time for the strongest men to preach the strongest message in the
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:10:00.260]   context of the strongest ministries." What does that mean? What does it mean to be a
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:07.500]   strong man? What does it mean to preach a strong message? What does it mean to have
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:17.860]   a strong ministry? I believe this 16th verse of 1 Timothy chapter 4 is a good answer to
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:26.860]   those questions. "Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:36.380]   by so doing you will save both yourselves and your hearers." There are two statements
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:48.140]   in the verse. One is a call to watchfulness. One is a call to perseverance. And with the
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:59.860]   time remaining, I want us to just meditate together on these high and holy duties. First,
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:07.660]   there is a call to watchfulness. Verse 16 begins with a double command, "Keep a close
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:18.380]   watch on yourself and on the teaching." The command is to keep a close watch. The verb
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:32.780]   means to hold fast or to hold firmly. The New International Version reads, "Watch."
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:41.820]   The King James Version reads, "Take heed." The New American Standard Bible reads, "Pay
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:51.100]   close attention." In Acts chapter 3, Peter and John went up to the temple at the hour
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:57.740]   of prayer. And there they met a man who was lame from birth, who was sat by the beautiful
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:07.100]   gate of the temple to ask of the arms of the worshipers. He asked Peter and John if they
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.580]   could spare any change. And in response to his request for money, Peter said, "Look
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:22.160]   at us." Acts chapter 3 verse 5 reads, "And he fixed his attention on them, expecting
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:33.660]   to receive something from them." Fixed his attention translates the verb of verse 16.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:42.780]   To keep a close watch is to fix your attention. And the text is in a grammatical emphasis
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:57.460]   that indicates continual action or repeated activity. Keep keeping a close watch on yourself
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:04.980]   and on the teaching. This is the Christian minister's perpetual duty. There is no season
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:17.340]   of life or ministry in which you can afford to neglect this call to watchfulness. The
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:25.060]   rookie minister in this room finds the right course by keeping a close watch on himself
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:34.060]   and on his teaching. The seasoned ministers in this room stay on the right course by keeping
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:44.020]   a close watch on himself and on his teaching. The call to watchfulness addresses two intricately
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:59.100]   connected spheres of ministerial responsibility on yourself and on the teaching. It is both
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:08.420]   and, brothers, not either or. We are inclined to emphasize one duty over the other based
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:17.740]   upon how we are wired. Some read the verse to say mentally as they picture it, "Keep
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:26.180]   a close watch on yourself and on the teaching." And others read the verse to say, "Keep a
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:38.780]   close watch on yourself and the teaching." The two-fold object of ongoing vigilance is
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:49.380]   mutually important. A godly life does not excuse false teaching, and sound doctrine
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:59.220]   does not excuse ungodly behavior. Your life should testify to the message you proclaim.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:13.260]   The minister who endures to the end is characterized by personal holiness and expositional ministry.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:22.380]   First, personal holiness. I was called to pastor my first church here in Los Angeles
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:28.580]   at the age of 17. I was a senior in high school, as I often qualify. I don't recommend that.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:37.260]   It's just my testimony. And the night I was installed as the pastor of the church, when
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:46.940]   the service was over, a group of older pastors pulled me to the side and said, "We need to
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:53.940]   talk to you." I can't begin to tell you how nervous I was. I didn't know what was about
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:00.340]   to happen. They pulled me aside, and they were circling around me, and they said, "Before
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.540]   we leave this service tonight, we need to say something to you personally and privately."
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:16.780]   They said, "You're a young man, and at some point your mind will turn toward dating. Make
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:31.520]   sure you don't date anyone in the church." That was their sage advice. I was thinking
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:42.980]   to myself, "What, you want me to come to your church and find somebody to date?"
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:52.420]   If I could rewind that moment and re-script that moment, where those older men had my
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.340]   attention and I would have taken heed to anything they said to me that night, I wish they would
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:11.300]   have simply said to me, "Be holy." In 1 Timothy chapter 4, verse 16, Paul does not tell Timothy
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:19.860]   to be careful or be discreet or anything like that. Paul tells Timothy to be holy, to be
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:28.820]   godly, to be Christ-like, to keep a close watch on himself. We have already noted that
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:35.700]   the call to God, your character, and convictions go together, character and convictions. But
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:44.260]   it should also be noted that how one lives is mentioned here before what one teaches.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:52.100]   John Calvin said, "Doctrine will be of little avail if there be not a corresponding goodness
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:18:01.900]   and holiness of life." What does it mean to watch your life? The answer to this question
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.640]   deserves a book-length answer, but permit me to challenge you to watch your life in
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:14.460]   three areas, your time, your money, and your relationships. I mention these because these
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:22.400]   are objective, independent, external indicators of your true spiritual devotion. My favorite
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.300]   little prayer course that my mother taught me as a boy, I still sing to this day, "Lord,
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:33.980]   I want to be a Christian in my heart." But when I sing that, I also can't forget about
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:43.420]   Jeremiah 17, verse 9, that says, "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:51.540]   sick." Who can understand it? Your time, your money, your relationships have a way
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.860]   of telling the truth about what's in your heart.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:05.540]   So brothers, how are you spending your time? I get a chance to be around pastors in various
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.420]   parts of the country over the course of the year, and I believe from my perch that more
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:19.820]   pastors are guilty of workaholism than slothfulness. So I don't want to waste this time challenging
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:26.420]   you to get busy, but I want to ask, has your busyness crowded out your personal devotion
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:37.700]   to the Lord? Are you making time in the private chambers of your own praying ground for believing
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:46.300]   prayer, Bible intake, and self-examination?
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:53.180]   My first preaching professor challenged us regularly to be preachers who are like roots,
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:20:03.940]   not pipes. Water passes through a pipe without any positive effect on the pipe. In fact,
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:11.780]   over time, the passing of the water will rust the pipe. But as water passes through the
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:23.820]   roots to the tree, the roots get stronger. How are you spending your time, and how are
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.900]   you managing your money?
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:34.620]   I just feel like I grew up in church hearing preachers always admonish the saints that
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.460]   the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And then when I read that text in
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:46.260]   1 Timothy chapter 6 for the first time for myself, I was shocked to discover that this
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:58.180]   biblical warning is really to the minister, not just the members. It is a warning to those
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:11.420]   who would think or preach that godliness is a means to financial gain. And it is to those
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:29.500]   who are seduced by that error, seduced by money, that the warning of 1 Timothy 6 comes.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:36.580]   I was a young man, and I went to a minister's fellowship, and one of the other young ministers
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:43.660]   there asked to talk to me. He worked on staff at a church, and he got in trouble because
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:51.100]   the pastor had been away that Sunday, and he led the service, and the money was down.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:57.060]   And I was shocked. I couldn't believe this. And I said, "This is a godly pastor. There's
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.380]   no way that happened." He says, "You're right, H.B., he is a good man." I'll never forget
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   this phrase. But his values change when it comes to money. That's a contradiction that
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:21.900]   dishonors God. 1 Timothy chapter 6 verses 9 and 10 says, "But those who desire to be
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:28.820]   rich fall into temptation, into snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.060]   people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all kinds of
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.140]   evils, and it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:47.420]   pierced themselves through with many sorrows." How are you spending your time? How are you
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:54.180]   managing your money, and how are you treating your relationships? Timothy was a young man
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:23:01.220]   serving a large congregation in a big city. How was he to leave that church? Paul does
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:08.020]   not give Timothy any management principles from the business world. He instructs Timothy
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:16.500]   to leave the church as he would care for his family. 1 Timothy chapter 5 verses 1 and 2,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:24.340]   "Do not rebuke an older man, but encourage him as you would a father, younger men as
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:36.380]   brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity." It's called
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:46.420]   to personal and pastoral and pure relationships.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:53.640]   Not only does this first statement in verse 16 address the matter of personal holiness,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:05.660]   it also emphasizes the importance of expositional ministry. A slave owner's son broke the rules
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:15.500]   by sneaking into the slave quarters to read the Bible to the slaves. Hearing God's Word,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.820]   they got saved. One of those slaves became low sick, and when the master checked on the
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:27.940]   dying slave, he asked if there was anything he could do for that slave before he died,
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:37.820]   and to the master's surprise, the slave asked him to go sin for his son who knew how to
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:47.600]   make the book talk. Brothers, it is appointed to every man to die and then stand before
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:55.260]   God in judgment. What eternal souls need more than anything else, they need faithful men
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:01.860]   who know how to make the book talk. And this is what Paul is saying in verse 16, "Keep
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:10.000]   a close watch on yourself and on the teaching." Note the definite article. Timothy was not
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:22.700]   just to watch his teaching, but the teaching. It's what Acts 2.42 calls the apostles' teaching.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:31.220]   The teaching reminds us that it's not about the act of teaching. It's about the truth
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:44.020]   that you teach. Dotted all over this country are churches that still formally have an orthodox
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:51.260]   statement of faith, but the pulpit is filled by a preacher who has abandoned Biblical teaching
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:26:03.300]   for another gospel. Paul rebukes such false teaching. For instance, 1 Timothy chapter
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   1 verse 10 rebukes whatever is contrary to sound doctrine. 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:18.180]   3 rebukes anyone who teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:23.660]   our Lord Jesus Christ. And when you read those passage, brothers, you'll also see that in
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:37.660]   his rebuke of false teaching, life and doctrine go together. What a man teaches and how a
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:47.500]   man lives are connected. Here positively 1 Timothy 4 verse 6 tells Timothy to keep a
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:54.540]   close watch on himself and the teaching. Those who do not keep a close watch on themselves
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:00.900]   are prone to tamper with the teachings to either accommodate or cover up their sinful
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:10.100]   ways and desires. A man's character at the same time is revealed by what he teaches.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:26.980]   The two go together. 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 15 is a life verse for me. Do your best to
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:34.540]   present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:42.620]   handling the word of truth. There are three questions I regularly ask myself from 2 Timothy
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:53.920]   2 verse 15. Number one, "Is God well pleased with me?" Do your best to present yourself
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:05.180]   to God as one approved. Question two, "Is my work well done?" A worker who has no need
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:17.460]   to be ashamed. And thirdly, "Is the word of God rightly handled?" Rightly handling the
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:25.100]   word of truth. Charles Spurgeon said, "This every Christian minister must do if he would
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:32.200]   make full proof of his ministry and if he would be clear of the blood of his hearers
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:45.280]   at that last great day." 2 Timothy chapter 4 verses 1 and 2 says, "I charge you in the
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:53.540]   presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead. By his appearing
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:29:01.600]   in his kingdom, preach the word. Be ready in season and out of season. Reprove, rebuke,
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:08.800]   and exhort with complete patience and teaching." Our central, primary, and definitive function
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:30.960]   as ministers is to preach the word. The imperative is all important. Preach. But so is the object.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:39.080]   Preach the word. You have been placed under assignment to present a message and you do
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:49.040]   not have editorial authority over the message. The power of preaching does not rest in the
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:58.680]   function of preaching. The power of preaching rests in the content of preaching. Or if I
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:04.880]   could say it another way, it is not our preaching that makes the gospel work, it's the gospel
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   that makes our lousy preaching work, right? So we must preach the word. Preach the word,
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:27.320]   brothers, not personal opinion. Preach the word, not motivational speeches. Preach the
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:40.480]   word, not self-help advice. Preach the word, not popular psychology. Preach the word, not
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:58.360]   health and wealth. Preach the word, not political viewpoints. Preach the word, not worldly theories.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:10.480]   The verse 16 begins with a call to watchfulness and it ends by giving us a call to perseverance.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:18.320]   This verse asserts what one has called the extraordinary seriousness of pastoral ministry.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:26.760]   The verse begins by telling the minister what to do. Keep a close watch on your life and
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:36.040]   on the teaching. And then verse 16 ends by telling us how to do it and why to do it.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:46.560]   Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourselves and your hearers. This
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:52.880]   statement teaches the practice and purpose of ministerial perseverance. Let me lean into
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:32:04.400]   both and then we'll pray together. The practice of ministerial perseverance. I wrote a little
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:11.440]   book on pastoral ministry, and there are times that I am asked to sign it by someone and
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:25.320]   I often put above my signature 1 Timothy 4, verse 16. I really do believe this verse succinctly
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:34.820]   states the whole matter of Christian ministry. Brothers, this is the whole ballgame. Guard
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:48.520]   your life and your doctrine. Watch your character and your convictions. Pay close attention
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:33:03.600]   to yourself and to the teaching. That's the work of the minister. That's the whole ballgame.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:11.200]   Nothing more, nothing less, nothing else. How you say it should be there? There has
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:32.660]   to be something else. You're right. One more thing. Persist in this. After you keep keeping
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:44.320]   a close watch on your life and teaching, Paul says, "Then just hit repeat." And keep persisting
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:51.780]   in this. The term means to remain under. It is the picture of one who is under a heavy
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.220]   load and yet he doesn't give up or give in or give out. He keeps pressing on even though
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:15.420]   the load is heavy. Brothers, faithful ministers, persevere. Persevere in what? The most obvious
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:25.260]   answer is that Timothy is to persist in keeping a close watch on himself and his teaching.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:44.820]   I've given you the assignment. Be steadfast, enduring it, persevering it.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:53.460]   I am talking to men in this room. You are serving the Lord at a hard place during a
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:35:02.660]   hard time. And permit me to just take the liberty this moment to say from one brother
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:19.760]   to another, "Hang in there. Hang in there, brother. It may be hard, but is there a witness
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:29.620]   in the house? It's worth it." 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 58 says, "Therefore, my
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:37.740]   beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:46.980]   knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verses
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:56.940]   16 through 18 says, "So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:06.640]   inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light, momentary affliction is preparing
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:15.900]   for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison. As we look not to the things that
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.300]   are seen, but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient,
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:35.700]   but the things that are unseen are eternal." One more, Galatians 6 and 9, "Let us not grow
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:49.620]   weary of doing good. For in due season we will reap if we do not give up." And so we
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:59.260]   see the practice of ministerial perseverance, but also the purpose of ministerial perseverance.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.900]   Paul gives a command, "Persist in this." Then he states the reason, "For by so doing you
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:14.300]   will save both yourself and your hearers." This incentive is profound. It's remarkable.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.580]   And as you read the commentators, you'll see it's somewhat controversial.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:23.900]   However, before we meditate on what Paul says, would you think a moment about what he does
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:36.660]   not say? The Christian minister is offered many diverse goals to pursue by the world
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:53.620]   that we live in. When I was a boy in school, we used to play a game called "Get Like Me."
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:38:04.980]   It was gambling. I didn't know. I just thought about it last night. It was gambling. The
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.540]   first person would take a quarter and flip the quarter, and it would fall on heads and
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:14.700]   tails, and he'd say, "Get like me." And then you, the second person would flip their quarter,
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:20.540]   and if it landed on whatever the first quarter was, he got it. It just dawned on me that
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:35.580]   I was gambling. I was thinking about that because it's strange. All these years later,
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:47.180]   it sometimes feels like that boyhood game is being played by so many books and podcasts
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:56.900]   and conferences are glorified games of "Get Like Me." Paul would not have Timothy to
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:05.980]   gamble away his calling for such fleshly and foolish games. And so, just exegete the white
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:13.940]   spaces with me for a moment and consider what Paul does not say. He does not say, "Persist
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:21.540]   in this with the promise of a larger church." He does not guarantee a big platform. He does
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:29.740]   not mention worldly success. He does not assure a well-known name. He does not predict book
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:35.060]   deals and book sales. He does not discuss financial prosperity, and he does not vow
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:46.440]   ministerial prominence. Paul gives Timothy a Christ-exalting, Gospel-saturated, eternity-driven
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:57.220]   reason to persist in keeping a close watch on himself and his teaching. "For by so doing,
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:05.340]   you will save both yourself and your hearers." This verse is no proof text for salvation
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:11.020]   by works. Ephesians chapter 2, verses 8 and 9 make it plain, "For by grace you have been
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   saved through faith, and this is not your own doing. It is the gift of God, not the
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:22.500]   results of works, so that no one may boast." Sinners are saved by grace through faith in
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:31.020]   Christ plus or minus nothing. Yet Paul was convinced that the minister's perseverance
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.640]   in keeping a close watch on his life and teaching had eternal implications for both himself
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:47.140]   and his hearers. John Stott wrote, "Perseverance is not a meritorious cause, but rather the
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:57.100]   ultimate evidence of our salvation." The preacher's own assurance and sanctification
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:02.380]   and eternal reward are tied to his perseverance in watching his life and doctrine. In 1 Corinthians
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:08.780]   chapter 9, verses 24 through 27, Paul says, "Do you not know that in every race all the
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:18.900]   runners run, but only one receives the prize?" It's a run that you may obtain it. Every athlete
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.380]   exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:33.460]   we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly. I do not box as one beating the air, but I
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:50.540]   discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:42:03.020]   be disqualified. The Greek scholar A.T. Robinson commented here, "It is a humbling thought
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:12.580]   for all of us to see this wholesome fear instead of a smug complacency in the greatest of all
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:21.900]   heralds of Christ." "Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:29.260]   your hearers. With due concern for his own soul, the minister must also have a holy concern
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:37.820]   for the salvation of his hearers." Note the word here, "hearers." It's a subtle condemnation
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:43.340]   of those who would put on a show to reach people. Remember, what you use to reach them
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:56.580]   is what you'll have to use to keep them. Our people need to hear the truth, not see a show.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:06.060]   Romans chapter 10 verse 13 is a glorious promise, is it not? "For everyone who calls on the
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:12.560]   name of the Lord shall be saved." As I say it, my King James upbringing is rising up
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:25.020]   on me. It said, "Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord." What a glorious promise.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:30.000]   But then verses 14 and 15 of Romans 10 goes on to present a series of dilemmas that prevent
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:39.740]   lost people from calling on the Lord for salvation. How then will they call on Him in whom they
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:49.540]   have not believed? And how are they to believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:55.420]   are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:08.000]   sent? The MacArthur Study Bible footnotes this verse by saying, "By careful attention
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.020]   to his own godly life and faithful preaching of the Word, Timothy would continue to be
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:30.580]   the human instrument God used to bring the gospel and save some who heard him."
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:45.860]   I grew up in one church in one city basically. In 2008, I was called to serve a church on
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:55.180]   the other side of the country. I had been pastoring for a while, but I pastored a church
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:01.040]   where I knew everyone. I was going to a church where not only did I not know anyone in the
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:07.320]   church, I didn't know anyone really in the city. And I called a friend of mine who had
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.900]   recently relocated. He had had a couple of pastoral transitions over the years, and I
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:21.640]   asked his advice. "When I get boots on the ground, Keelan, in this new place, what should
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:32.540]   I focus on? What should I prioritize? What should I give my attention to?" And Keelan
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:50.420]   got all parabolic on me and told me a story. He said that there was a town with a bank,
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:46:03.580]   and the bandits came to town to rob the bank. But when they arrived, they saw that the bank
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:15.020]   was well guarded and there was no way to burst in. But determined, the bandits went to the
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:28.100]   outskirts of town and started setting barns on fire. And the people in the town all went
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:33.540]   out to put out the fires in the barns, and while they were out putting out the fires
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:47.380]   in the barns, the bandits robbed the bank. Do you get it? He said, "H.B., when you get
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:47:01.780]   to that new work, there will be a lot of fires to put out, but by all means, guard the bank."
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:16.420]   Whatever season of ministry you find yourself in, brother, by all means, guard the bank.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:32.140]   How do you guard the bank? Glad you asked. Keep a close watch on yourself and on the
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:47.260]   teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:48:04.420]   Let's pray. Wait. In fact, would you indulge me? I think after these reminders, it would
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:12.380]   be appropriate for us to pray for one another. If you don't know the name of the brother
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:18.540]   who is sitting next to you, can you just get their name, and let's just take a moment all
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:27.780]   over this room to pray for each other. And I'll close us in just a moment. Brothers,
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:50.180]   let's get a name, and let's go to God in prayer. Let's use this time wisely.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:49:10.180]   [Prayer]
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:30.180]   [Prayer]
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:50.180]   [Prayer]
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:50:10.180]   [Prayer]
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:30.180]   [Prayer]
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:50.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your Word. We thank You for these reminders of what it
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:59.980]   means to be gospel ministers, what it means to be ambassadors of Christ, what it means
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:16.580]   to be faithful servants. Our hearts are burdened, Lord, as we think about these things that
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:27.620]   this verse raises for our attention and consider those that we know who started fast but did
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:47.380]   not finish strong. And we're burdened, Father, for those who may not feel that weight, who
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:58.540]   hear these reminders and respond to them callously with a spirit of carelessness and presumption.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:10.460]   Lord, would You help us to take heed, those of us who think we are standing firm, help
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:20.460]   us to take heed lest we fall, and to remember that no temptation has overtaken us except
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:28.580]   that which is common to man. You are faithful. You will not allow us to be tempted above
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.580]   what we are able, and along with the temptation will provide a way of escape so that we may
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:47.020]   bear up under it. Lord, I thank You that You are the great Master of the house that has
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:53.340]   many vessels, some of gold and silver and some of wood and clay. And I ask that You
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:53:03.140]   would help us, Lord, to cleanse ourselves of whatever is dishonorable so that we might
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:15.540]   be clean vessels fit for the Master's use, ready for every good work. Help us, Lord,
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:21.980]   to guard our lives and to guard our doctrine, and to persevere in so doing to ensure our
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:30.300]   salvation and the salvation of those who hear us, Lord. Give us hearts that would endure
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:40.980]   to the end. I do, Lord, pray for my brothers under the sound of my voice who find themselves
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:53.300]   at a quitting point. They feel alone. The burden is heavy. They live with criticism,
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:54:11.540]   facing outright persecution. Thank You that, Lord, You call servants like that blessed.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:22.660]   May we rejoice and be glad, knowing that our reward is in heaven, for so they persecuted
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:32.360]   the prophets who were before us. And would You give us, Lord, a burden to pray, to continue
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:38.980]   in prayer for one another, as prayer advertises our dependence upon You. We are nothing without
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:45.300]   You, but we rejoice that Your grace is sufficient for us, and Your strength is perfected in
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:50.340]   our weakness. We rejoice in this in Jesus' name, amen. God bless you, brothers.
