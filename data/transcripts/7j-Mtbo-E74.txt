[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.800]   Hello.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.000]   Today, I'm excited to introduce Webhook Automations
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   and Weights and Biases.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.880]   This is going to allow teams to integrate
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.920]   CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions with the Model Registry.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.800]   So let's first set up a webhook.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.200]   First thing we need to do is set up a secret
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.560]   so that Weights and Biases can authenticate
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.680]   to our external tool.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.760]   Weights and Biases has a secret store where you can add your secret
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.160]   and access it later on when you configure the automation.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.240]   We next need to create the webhook.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.960]   And this just consists of the name of the webhook,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.340]   along with the URL that we want to post to,
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.760]   and then the secret that we're going to authenticate with.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.120]   Once that's created, we need to go to the Model Registry
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000]   to configure the automation.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.960]   CI/CD machine learning consists of handing off model artifacts
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.000]   to be containerized, tested, and deployed.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.360]   Here, I have a registered model with several past versions
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.880]   as the model has been retrained over time.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.080]   Clicking into Details, I can see the model card
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.400]   describing how to use it, how it was made.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.360]   I'm going to click on Automations here.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.280]   I'll be able to create a new automation, which
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   occurs when certain events happen
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.320]   to this registered model.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.160]   Creating an automation, I have two options here.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.440]   One, when a new version is added to this registered model,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.840]   so when a new candidate model is added,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.120]   or when an artifact alias is added,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.000]   such as when someone tags this model with the production
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.840]   alias.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.960]   I'm going to click the first one.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.240]   The action type here, I can choose either a launch job
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.360]   or a webhook.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.240]   With the webhook, I'll select the one that I just created.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.920]   And then I need to add in a payload.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.440]   The payload describes what context
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.840]   I'm going to pass from Weights and Biases
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.160]   into my external tool.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.480]   In this case, I want to trigger a GitHub action
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.680]   to test the model and generate a Weights and Biases report,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320]   or inspection.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.800]   So I want to pass in information about the specific model
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.960]   version that triggered this automation.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.360]   Through these template strings, we can add all of that context.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.320]   Here, I'm going to indicate the event type, along
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.920]   with the challenger model, so the new model that's
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.040]   being added, the incumbent or champion model
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640]   that I want to compare it to, along with a test data
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.120]   set to run it through, the author,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.200]   and then some other Weights and Biases information.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.680]   And with that, I can name this automation test model
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.200]   and create.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.640]   We now have an automation that, when a new model is added
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   to this registry, a POST request will trigger a GitHub action
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.720]   to run, test the model, and evaluate it.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.560]   So let's go ahead and do that.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.840]   I go back to a team project, which
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.240]   has a bunch of candidate models.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.000]   I should then be able to link a new one.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:40.320]   Linking that model, we can now see a GitHub action now
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.240]   taking place.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.800]   Clicking into it, we can see that we're
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.920]   installing some dependencies, logging into Weights
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.040]   and Biases, retrieving the artifacts from Weights
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.840]   and Biases, running tests, and generating a comparison report.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.240]   And that's all you need to do to get started with Weights
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.800]   and Biases Webhook Automations.
