[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   [silence]
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.240]   You need about eight ounces or 240 milliliters of fluid
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.560]   per hour for the first 10 hours of your day after waking.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.160]   Now, why did I say for the first 10 hours?
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.720]   Well, it turns out that the filtration of fluids
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.500]   from your body, which is accomplished, of course,
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.760]   by your kidneys and by way of your bladder
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.420]   and the excretion of fluid out urethra,
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.920]   so-called urination,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.360]   is strongly, strongly circadian dependent,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.960]   meaning the cells of your kidney
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720]   and the cells even of your gut,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.000]   in fact, all the cells of your body,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.980]   but especially the cells of your kidney,
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.840]   which filter the fluid that comes into your body
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.520]   and that makes certain hormones like vasopressin,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.800]   which is anti-diuretic hormone,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040]   all of that functioning of the kidney
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.000]   is under strong regulation
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.200]   by so-called circadian clock genes.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.400]   Circadian clock genes are genes
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.140]   that are expressed in every cell,
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.200]   but that in certain cells of the body
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.920]   very strongly impact whether or not that organ,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.080]   in this case, the kidney,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.600]   is going to be activated, meaning functioning,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.760]   at a very high level or at a reduced level.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.360]   And we can make all of this very simple
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   by simply stating what's contained in this beautiful review
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.040]   that I'll provide a link to if you want to learn more
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.440]   called "Circadian Rhythms in the Kidney."
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.360]   And basically what is known
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.260]   is that for the first 10 hours after waking,
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.880]   your kidney is filtering fluid within your body
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.440]   at a very rapid rate.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.680]   There are a number of different cell types that do that,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.880]   but they are basically taking that fluid,
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.520]   pulling out any contaminants,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.920]   using hormones such as anti-diuretic hormone, vasopressin,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.280]   to adjust whether or not you're going to hold onto fluid
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.560]   or release more fluid from your body in the form of urine,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000]   depending on the salt concentration,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.920]   depending on how much fluid you need,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.120]   your work output, the conditions you're in, all of that.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.280]   However, at about 10 hours after waking,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.600]   your kidney really starts to reduce
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.120]   its overall level of functioning.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.640]   Now, that doesn't mean that your kidney
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.440]   cannot filter fluid 11 or 12 or 16 hours after waking,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.920]   but it becomes far less efficient at doing so.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080]   And thank goodness it does,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.480]   because you do not want your kidney filtering fluid
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.120]   at the same rate at midnight,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.920]   assuming you wake up at say 7 or 8 or 9 a.m.,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.700]   that it was filtering fluid at 10 a.m.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.680]   In fact, we can say that if you want to reduce
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.220]   your nighttime waking in order to urinate,
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.960]   which is a common, common question and concern
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   that many people have,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.440]   how can I avoid waking up in the middle of the night
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.280]   to urinate?
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.480]   And there I say, it's perfectly normal to wake up once,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.400]   maybe twice each night to urinate.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940]   But if you want to reduce the number of times
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.820]   that you wake up in order to urinate across the night,
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.440]   maybe even make that number zero times,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   you will greatly benefit by doing three things.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   First of all, make sure that you're hydrating sufficiently
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.080]   during the daytime.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.240]   That will ensure that you are not excessively thirsty
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.520]   in the evening and therefore consuming a lot more fluid.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.720]   Second, and related to that first point,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.920]   is that you do want to reduce your fluid intake at night,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.640]   provided you hydrated sufficiently throughout the day.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.360]   And believe it or not,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   the rate at which fluid moves from your gut
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   and into the cells and tissues of your body,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.460]   and then from your bladder into urine,
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.820]   is determined not just by the volume of fluid you ingest,
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.000]   but also the rate at which you ingest that fluid.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   And you might be thinking, that's crazy.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   That makes no sense at all, right?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.960]   If I drink a ton of fluid slowly,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.840]   doesn't it still mean that I'm going to urinate a ton?
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   Yes and no.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.160]   It also stands to reason that you might ask,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.800]   if I ingest very little fluid, but I do it very fast,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.760]   is it going to be the case
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.560]   that I'm going to urinate it out very quickly?
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.960]   Well, yes and no.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.920]   The point is that the fluid filtration systems of your body
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.600]   that range from the gut to the bladder
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.300]   and include the kidney, of course,
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.660]   depend not just on the volume,
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.860]   but on the rate of fluid that you ingest.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.020]   Because of those mechanosensors that we talked about earlier,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.500]   if you gulp down a bunch of fluids,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.660]   you are going to excrete those fluids more quickly
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.620]   than if you sip them slowly.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.620]   Excuse me, sip them slowly.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.980]   So here's what I recommend.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.180]   Throughout the day when you're trying
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.060]   to get your adequate yield of water or other beverages,
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.880]   feel free to gulp that fluid or sip it.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.680]   I'm a gulper, not a sipper,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.520]   but many of you are going to be sippers, not gulpers.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.880]   Consume fluid at the rate that feels right to you,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.540]   but feel comfortable gulping that fluid.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.520]   However, in the evening,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   if you are somebody who has challenges
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.300]   with waking up excessively in the middle of the night,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.640]   reduce your fluid intake,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.120]   provided you've hydrated properly throughout the day.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.280]   And I suggest consuming no more than five,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.560]   maybe eight ounces of fluid
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.940]   between the time of 10 hours after waking
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.260]   and when you go to sleep.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.460]   Again, if you're very thirsty or you under hydrate
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.380]   or it's very hot, feel free to ingest more fluid, please.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.460]   But most people will find
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.940]   that if they reduce their fluid intake
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.500]   to about five ounces or less of fluid
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.260]   in that later part of the day,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.580]   after 10 hours of having woken up and before sleep,
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.880]   and they sip those beverages as opposed to gulping them,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.380]   that they will have fewer bouts
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.580]   of waking up in the middle of the night
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.380]   to go to the restroom and ideally zero.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.960]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.540]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.120]   (upbeat music)
